        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "title": "Single-cell transcriptional gene signature analysis identifies IL-17 signaling pathway as the key pathway in sepsis.",
        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population. Taken together, we concluded that the IL-17 signaling pathway serves as a significant potential mechanism of sepsis and provides a promising therapeutic target for sepsis treatment. This research will further deepen our understanding of sepsis development.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of childhood mortality. Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations of demographic, clinical, laboratory, organ dysfunction, and illness severity variable values with: 1) sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock in children with infection and 2) multiple organ dysfunction or death in children with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms \"sepsis,\" \"septicemia,\" or \"septic shock\" in the title or abstract. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Strong associations of several markers of organ dysfunction with the outcomes of interest among infected and septic children support their inclusion in the data validation phase of the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce.",

        "title": "Identification and validation of a novel four-gene diagnostic model for neonatal early-onset sepsis with bacterial infection.",
        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method. The model has better diagnostic performance compared with conventional inflammatory indicators such as CRP, Hb, NEU%, and PCT.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To study the metabolic mechanism of neonatal sepsis at different stages by analyzing the metabolic pathways involving the serum metabolites with significant differences in neonates with sepsis at different time points after admission. METHODS: A total of 20 neonates with sepsis who were hospitalized in the Department of Neonatology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, from January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2020 were enrolled as the sepsis group. Venous blood samples were collected on days 1, 4, and 7 after admission. Ten healthy neonates who underwent physical examination during the same period were enrolled as the control group. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for the metabonomic analysis of serum samples to investigate the change in metabolomics in neonates with sepsis at different time points. RESULTS: On day 1 after admission, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between the sepsis and control groups were mainly involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid skeleton. For the sepsis group, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 4 after admission were mainly involved in pyruvate metabolism, and those between days 4 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in the metabolism of cysteine and methionine. The differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in ascorbic acid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic mechanism of serum metabolites varies at different stages in neonates with sepsis and is mainly associated with terpenoid skeleton biosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism, cysteine/methionine metabolism, and ascorbic acid metabolism.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide expression profiles have been previously employed as clinical research diagnostic tools for newborn sepsis. We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Sepsis recognition is a clinical challenge in children. We aim to determine whether peripheral blood gene expression profiles are associated with pathogen type and sepsis severity in children with suspected sepsis. METHODS: This was a prospective pilot observational study in a tertiary pediatric emergency department with a convenience sample of children enrolled. Participants were older than 56 days and younger than 18 years, had suspected sepsis, and had not received broad-spectrum antibiotics in the previous 4 hours. Primary outcome was source pathogen, defined as confirmed bacterial source from sterile body fluid or confirmed viral source. Secondary outcome was sepsis severity, defined as maximum therapy required for shock reversal in the first 3 hospital days. We drew peripheral blood for ribonucleic acid isolation at the sepsis protocol activation, obtained gene expression measures with the GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array, and conducted differential expression analysis. RESULTS: We collected ribonucleic acid samples from a convenience sample of 122 children with suspected sepsis and 12 healthy controls. We compared the 66 children (54%) with confirmed bacterial or viral infection and found 558 differentially expressed genes, many related to interferon signaling or viral immunity. We did not find statistically significant gene expression differences in patients according to sepsis severity. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates feasibility of evaluating gene expression profiling data in children evaluated for sepsis in the pediatric emergency department setting. Our results suggest that gene expression profiling may facilitate identification of source pathogen in children with suspected sepsis, which could ultimately lead to improved tailoring of sepsis treatment and antimicrobial stewardship.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to suspected or proven infection. Given its importance in terms of morbidity and mortality, a number of initiatives by several professional societies in recent years have led to the development of guidelines for the recognition and timely management of sepsis. The principal elements of the most recent guidelines are summarized in this practice point. These elements include recognition of changes in clinical condition and vital signs, such as fever, tachycardia, and changes in peripheral perfusion, which should raise concern for sepsis; initial stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation; timely administration of empiric antimicrobial therapy; use of fluid boluses and vasoactive medications; and specific considerations in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as the use of corticosteroids for possible adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic-adrenal suppression. Two changes from previous guidelines are the concern for fluid overload, implying the need for clinical re-assessment after administration of each fluid bolus, and the removal of dopamine as the initial vasoactive agent for use in hypotensive paediatric patients, with recommendations for the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine as dictated by the clinical context.

METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection.

        "title": "Magnitude and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of bacteria isolated from pediatric sepsis cases at University of Gondar Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among pediatric patients throughout the world. The varying microbiological pattern of sepsis warrants the need for researches on the causative organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. The epidemiology of neonatal and pediatric sepsis in Ethiopia is under-research. The objective of this study was to evaluate the burden of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among children suspected of sepsis. METHODS: An institutional-based prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 370 pediatric(age birth-15 years) patients suspected of sepsis at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized hospital from December 2020 to November 2021. Blood samples were collected aseptically and inoculated into Tryptone Soya Broth for culture. The organisms grown were identified by standard microbiological methods and subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing by modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method recommended by Clinical laboratory and standard institute. Methicillin resistance was confirmed using Cefoxitin disk diffusion method. Data entry and analysis were done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 software. A p-value less than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval was considered statically significant. RESULTS: Out of the total 370 study subjects, 21.6% (80/370) of them were culture positive. Of these, 43 (53.8%) and 37 (46.3%) were Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, respectively. The most prevalent Gram-positive bacterial isolate was Staphylococcus aureus (n\u2009=\u200924; 30%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (n\u2009=\u20097; 8.8%). Among the Gram-negative bacterial isolates, the leading bacteria was Klebsiella pneumoniae (n\u2009=\u200920; 25%) followed by Escherichia coli (n\u2009=\u20097; 8.8%). Clindamycin, Chloramphenicol, Gentamicin and Ciprofloxacin were the most effective antibiotics against Gram-positive bacterial isolates while Amikacin, Meropenem and Chloramphenicol were effective against Gram-negative pathogens. Methicillin resistance was detected in 45.8% of Staphylococcus aureus. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was observed in 76% of the bacterial isolates. CONCLUSION: Gram positive bacteria were the predominant isolates among pediatric sepsis cases and most of the bacterial isolates showed MDR. Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were frequently isolated bacteria. The high prevalence of drug resistance warrants rational use of antibiotics and the need for regular antibiotic susceptibility surveillance studies.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cannabis use has been the most commonly used illicit psychoactive substance in India. Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.",

        "title": "Antimicrobial Susceptibility Patterns of Bacterial Isolates from Blood Culture of Pediatric Patients with Suspected Sepsis at a Tertiary Care Hospital in Mymensingh, Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition, occurring when an infectious agent invades the body, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2\u03bcg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin. Early detection of bacteria followed by antimicrobial susceptibility test can help by selection of appropriate antibiotic and prevent spread of infection.",

Because of international travel and population movements, cases are also occasionally diagnosed in non-endemic countries. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Antitrypanosomal medicines to treat the disease are available gratis through the World Health Organization (WHO) thanks to a public-private partnership, and exclusive distribution of the majority of them enables WHO to gather information on all exported cases. Data collected by WHO are complemented by case reports and scientific publications. During 2011-2020, 49 cases of HAT were diagnosed in 16 non-endemic countries across five continents: 35 cases were caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, mainly in tourists visiting wildlife areas in eastern and southern Africa, and 14 cases were due to T. b. gambiense, mainly in African migrants originating from or visiting endemic areas in western and central Africa. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: HAT diagnosis in non-endemic countries is rare and can be challenging, but alertness and surveillance must be maintained to contribute to WHO's elimination goals.

        "title": "Identification and validation of a novel four-gene diagnostic model for neonatal early-onset sepsis with bacterial infection.",
        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method. The model has better diagnostic performance compared with conventional inflammatory indicators such as CRP, Hb, NEU%, and PCT.",

METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library up to the 1st of January 2021. We included studies that assessed neonatal sepsis and the following outcomes; (1) change in the metabolism compared to healthy neonates and/or (2) metabolomics compared to traditional diagnostic tools of neonatal sepsis. The screened abstracts were independently considered for eligibility by two researchers. PROSPERO ID: CRD42020164454. RESULTS: The search identified in total 762 articles. Fifteen articles were assessed for eligibility. Four studies were included, with totally 78 neonates. The studies used different diagnostic criteria and had between 1 and 16 sepsis cases. All studies with bacterial sepsis found alterations in the glucose and lactate metabolism, reflecting possible redistribution of glucose consumption from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to the lactate and pentose phosphate pathway. We also found signs of increased oxidative stress and fatty acid oxidation in sepsis cases. CONCLUSION: We found signs of metabolomic signatures in neonatal sepsis. This may lead to better understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and detection of new candidate biomarkers. Results should be validated in large-scale multicentre studies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adolescence is crucial period for laying the foundations for healthy development and mental well-being. The increasing prevalence of mental disorders amongst adolescents makes promotion of mental well-being and prevention interventions at schools important. UPRIGHT (Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally implemented in schools to improve and promote mental Health for Teenagers) is designed as a whole school approach (school community, students and families) to promote a culture of mental well-being and prevent mental disorders by enhancing resilience capacities. The present article aims at describing the rationale, conceptual framework, as well as methodology of implementation and evaluation of the UPRIGHT intervention. METHODS: UPRIGHT project is a research and innovation project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement No. 754919 (Duration: 48\u2009months). The theoretical framework has been developed by an innovative and multidisciplinary approach using a co-creation process inside the UPRIGHT Consortium (involving seven institutions from Spain, Italy, Poland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland). Resulted is the UPRIGHT programme with 18 skills related to 4 components: Mindfulness, Coping, Efficacy and Social and Emotional Learning. Among the five Pan-European regions, 34 schools have been currently involved (17 control; 17 intervention) and around 6000 adolescents and their families are foreseen to participate along a 3-year period of evaluation. Effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated as a randomized controlled trial including quantitative and qualitative analysis in the five Pan-European regions representative of the cultural and socioeconomic diversity. The cost-effectiveness assessment will be performed by simulation modelling methods. DISCUSSION: We expect a short- to medium-term improvement of mental well-being in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities. The study may provide robust evidence on intrapersonal, familiar and social environmental resilience factors promoting positive mental well-being.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most studies regarding late-onset sepsis (LOS) address selected populations (i.e., neonates with low birth weight or extremely preterm neonates). Studying all age groups is more suitable to assess the burden of single pathogens and their clinical relevance. METHODS: This is a retrospective regional study involving paediatric departments and NICUs in Emilia-Romagna (Italy). Regional laboratory databases were searched from 2009 to 2012. Records of infants (aged 4 to 90 days) with a positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture were retrospectively reviewed and analysed according to acquisition mode (whether hospital- or community-acquired). RESULTS: During the study period, there were 146,682 live births (LBs), with 296 patients experiencing 331 episodes of LOS (incidence rate: 2.3/1000 LBs). Brain lesions upon discharge from the hospital were found in 12.3% (40/296) of cases, with death occurring in 7.1% (23/296; 0.14/1000 LBs). With respect to full-term neonates, extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight neonates had very high risk of LOS and related mortality (> 100- and > 800-fold higher respectively). Hospital-acquired LOS (n = 209) was significantly associated with very low birth weight, extremely preterm birth, pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, and death (p< 0.01). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, catecholamine support (OR = 3.2), central venous line before LOS (OR = 14.9), and meningitis (OR = 44.7) were associated with brain lesions or death in hospital-acquired LOS (area under the ROC curve 0.81, H-L p = 0.41). Commonly identified pathogens included coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS n = 71, 21.4%), Escherichia coli (n = 50, 15.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 41, 12.4%) and Enterobacteriaceae (n = 41, 12.4%). Group B streptococcus was the predominant cause of meningitis (16 of 38 cases, 42%). Most pathogens were sensitive to first line antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first Italian data regarding late-onset sepsis (LOS) in all gestational age groups. Compared to full-term neonates, very high rates of LOS and mortality occurred in neonates with a lower birth weight and gestational age. Group B streptococcus was the leading cause of meningitis. Excluding CoNS, the predominant pathogens were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Neonates with hospital-acquired LOS had a worse outcome. Antibiotic associations, recommended for empirical treatment of hospital- or community-acquired LOS, were adequate.",

CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in the treatment of R/R childhood B-ALL, although the majority of reports have been in noninfant patients. Barriers to the successful implementation of CAR T-cell therapy in infant B-ALL include challenges related to apheresis, product manufacturing, and disease-specific considerations such as lineage switch. We describe our experience using 2 experimental CD19 CAR T-cell products, SCRI-CAR19 or SCRI-CAR19x22, for 19 patients with R/R infant B-ALL enrolled in 3 clinical trials. CAR T-cell products were successfully manufactured in 18 of 19 (94.7%) patients, with a median age of 22.5\u00a0months at enrollment (range, 14.5-40.1). Of 17 (94.1%) treated patients, 16 achieved a complete remission without detectable minimal residual disease. The 1-year leukemia-free survival was 75%, and 1-year overall survival was 76.5%, with a median follow-up time of 35.8\u00a0months (range, 1.7-83.6). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 14 of 17 (82.4%) patients, with only 1 patient experiencing grade 3 CRS. Neurotoxicity occurred in 2 of 17 (11.8%) patients with all events grade \u22642. With the successful early clinical experience of CAR T-cell therapy in this population, more systematic evaluation specific to infant ALL is warranted.",

        "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, still represents one of the most common causes of persisting disability with an early disease onset. Growing evidence suggests B cells to play a crucial role in its pathogenesis and progression. Over the last decades, monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against the surface protein CD20 have been intensively studied as a B cell targeting therapy in relapsing MS (RMS) as well as primary progressive MS (PPMS). Pivotal studies on anti-CD20 therapy in RMS showed remarkable clinical and radiological effects, especially on acute inflammation and relapse biology. These results paved the way for further research on the implication of B cells in the pathogenesis of MS. Besides controlling relapse development in RMS, ocrelizumab (OCR) also showed clinical benefits in patients with PPMS and became the first approved drug for this disease course. In this review, we provide an overview of the current anti-CD20 mabs used or tested for the treatment of MS-namely rituximab (RTX), OCR, ofatumumab (OFA), and ublituximab (UB). Besides their effectiveness, we also discuss possible limitations and safety concerns especially in regard to long-term treatment, both for this class of drugs overall as well as for each anti-CD20 mab individually. Additionally, we elucidate to what extent anti-CD20 therapy may alter the function of other immune cells, both directly or indirectly. Finally, we cover the current knowledge on repopulation of CD20",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: B cells can contribute to immune-mediated disorders. Targeting CD20 has proved to be efficacious in several B cell-mediated immunopathologies, as illustrated by the use of rituximab, the first anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Following rituximab, second- and third-generation anti-CD20 mAbs have been developed and tried in immune-mediated diseases, including obinutuzumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, and veltuzumab. However, their safety and efficacy has not been systematically reviewed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, and veltuzumab for the treatment of immune-mediated disorders compared to placebo, conventional treatment or other biologics. METHODS: The PRISMA checklist guided the reporting of the data. We searched the PubMed database between 4 October 2016 and 22 July 2021 concentrating on immune-mediated disorders. RESULTS: The literature search identified 2220 articles. After screening titles and abstracts against the inclusion and exclusion criteria and assessing full texts, 27 articles were finally included in a narrative synthesis.

        "title": "A Mathematical Description of the Bone Marrow Dynamics during CAR T-Cell Therapy in B-Cell Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.",
        "abstract": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated high rates of response in recurrent B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in children and young adults. Despite this success, a fraction of patients' experience relapse after treatment. Relapse is often preceded by recovery of healthy B cells, which suggests loss or dysfunction of CAR T-cells in bone marrow. This site is harder to access, and thus is not monitored as frequently as peripheral blood. Understanding the interplay between B cells, leukemic cells, and CAR T-cells in bone marrow is paramount in ascertaining the causes of lack of response. In this paper, we put forward a mathematical model representing the interaction between constantly renewing B cells, CAR T-cells, and leukemic cells in the bone marrow. Our model accounts for the maturation dynamics of B cells and incorporates effector and memory CAR T-cells. The model provides a plausible description of the dynamics of the various cellular compartments in bone marrow after CAR T infusion. After exploration of the parameter space, we found that the dynamics of CAR T product and disease were independent of the dose injected, initial B-cell load, and leukemia burden. We also show theoretically the importance of CAR T product attributes in determining therapy outcome, and have studied a variety of possible response scenarios, including second dosage schemes. We conclude by setting out ideas for the refinement of the model.",

Disease resistance or relapse after successful initial therapy and declining efficacy of subsequent rounds of treatment were the basis for the development of alternative anti-CD20-based antibody therapies. AREAS COVERED: The novel anti-CD20 antibodies of atumumab, ublituximab, and obinutuzumab were developed to be differentiated via structural and mechanistic features over rituximab. We provide an overview of preclinical and clinical data, and demonstrate ways in which the pharmacodynamic properties of these novel agents translate into clinical benefit for patients. EXPERT OPINION: Of the novel anti-CD20 antibodies, only obinutuzumab has shown consistently improved efficacy over rituximab in randomized pivotal trials in indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The Phase 3 GALLIUM trial demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival with obinutuzumab-based immunochemotherapy over rituximab-based immunochemotherapy. Novel combinations of obinutuzumab, including with chemotherapy-free options are being explored, such as with the newly approved combinations of obinutuzumab with venetoclax, ibrutinib, or acalabrutinib. The biggest unmet need remains in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; emerging options in this field include the use of CAR-T cells and T-cell bispecific antibodies.",

Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the B-cell antigen CD20 with enhanced B-cell targeting. AREAS COVERED: This evaluation is of the identical ULTIMATE (UbLiTuximab In Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Effects) I and II trials comparing ublituximab (TG-1101) and teriflunomide in relapsing multiple sclerosis. The primary efficacy end point was the annualized relapse rate and was lower in the ublituximab than the teriflunomide group. EXPERT OPINION: The continuation rates to oral teriflunomide in ULTIMATE were higher than in other trials, possibly because of the supervised double-dummy protocol used with intravenous ublituximab. This may have contributed to the higher efficacy with teriflunomide in this trial than previously reported. Nevertheless, ublituximab was more effective than teriflunomide at reducing the annualized relapse rates and MRI endpoints, but not for no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the ULTIMATE trials did show that ublituximab was superior to teriflunomide in NEDA. Long-term studies of the adverse effects of ublituximab are required. Despite the positive results from ULTIMATE for ublituximab, it is still under the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and conclusions should await their findings.",

In this review, we summarize the immunotherapeutic agents that have been approved for treating childhood cancers and provide an updated review of molecules expressed by pediatric cancers that are under study or are emerging candidates for future immunotherapies. Advances in our knowledge of tumor immunology and in genome profiling of cancers has led to the identification of new tumor-specific/associated antigens. While cell surface antigens are normally targeted in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent manner using antibody-based therapies, intracellular antigens are normally targeted with MHC-dependent T cell therapies. Glypican 2 (GPC2) and B7-H3 (CD276) are two cell surface antigens that are expressed by a variety of pediatric tumors such as neuroblastoma and potentially can have a positive impact on the treatment of pediatric cancers in the clinic.",

Diet and nu-trition, coupled with proper physical activity have a significant impact on the health status of the elderly with a decreased risk of disease being indicative of successful aging. Musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia are the most frequently reported disorders among the elderly community. METHODS: This study presents a systematic review of the literature on the potential benefits of several nutra-ceuticals in promoting healthy aging and in reducing the risk of chronic diseases in elderly individuals. RESULTS: Dietary components including vitamins (vitamin C, B vitamin and vitamin K) flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, anthocyanins, and isoflavones), minerals (e.g., magnesium, zinc and potassium) and other nutrients such phytoestrogens, amino acids, and omega-3 fatty acids help in slowing the aging process, which ultimately results in increased lifespan and longevity. CONCLUSIONS: This paper highlights the key nutrients and phytochemicals of nutraceutical importance for the healthy aging of the elderly population. Although the scientific literature provides evidences of therapeutic effectiveness of nutraceuticals, more in-depth clinical investigations are needed.",

        "abstract": "Several years ago, dozens of cases were described in patients with symptoms very similar to mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). This new disease entity was described as mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome (MPSPS). The name of the disease indicates that in addition to the typical symptoms of conventional MPS, patients develop other features such as congenital heart defects and kidney and hematopoietic system disorders. The symptoms are highly advanced, and patients usually do not survive past the second year of life. MPSPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a homozygous-specific mutation in the gene encoding the VPS33A protein. To date, it has been described in 41 patients. Patients with MPSPS exhibited excessive excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the urine and exceptionally high levels of heparan sulfate in the plasma, but the accumulation of substrates is not caused by a decrease in the activity of any lysosomal enzymes. Here, we discuss the pathomechanisms and symptoms of MPSPS, comparing them to those of MPS. Moreover, we asked the question whether MPSPS should be classified as a type of MPS or a separate disease, as contrary to 'classical' MPS types, despite GAG accumulation, no defects in lysosomal enzymes responsible for degradation of these compounds could be detected in MPSPS. The molecular mechanism of the appearance of GAG accumulation in MPSPS is suggested on the basis of results available in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Fatigue is defined as a symptom leading to the inability to continue functioning at the expected activity level. It is a highly prevalent symptom, challenging to frame into monodimensional pathophysiological mechanisms. As a result, fatigue is often underestimated in the clinical setting and is wrongly considered an unavoidable consequence of ageing. Several potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue have been proposed, including sleep patterns, autonomic nervous system abnormalities and biological complexity. Inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the most promising mechanisms through which malnutrition may cause fatigue. Not surprisingly, fatigue is highly prevalent in inflammatory conditions (e.g. COVID-19 infection). The nutritional status may also represent a critical factor in the development and presentation of fatigue, which may mimic the exhaustion of the individual's metabolic reserves. For example, the insufficient dietary intake of energy and proteins may determine the catabolism of body fat and muscles, disrupt the homeostatic balance and cause the onset of fatigue. It is necessary to conduct research on fatigue. By characterising its pathophysiological mechanisms, it will be possible to (1) support the design and development of targeted interventions, (2) improve the quality of life of many persons by acting on the symptom and (3) reduce the direct and indirect costs of a burdening condition typical of advancing age.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide expression profiles have been previously employed as clinical research diagnostic tools for newborn sepsis. We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of childhood mortality. Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal, progressive disease of the motor system. Most approved treatments have a modest effect on disease progression. Tofersen is a recently approved medication that acts by reducing a toxic protein found in a particular form of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This is an overview of the published clinical data for tofersen as well as some background information about tofersen and other treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.What were the results? Treatment with tofersen reduced levels of the target protein and markers of nervous system damage. In longer follow-up, patients treated with tofersen showed less disease progression.What do the results of the study mean? Treatment with tofersen likely slows progression in this form of inherited ALS, though longer duration studies would likely be needed to demonstrate this effect.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Parental intimate partner violence (IPV) and maternal depression are associated with increased risk of depression in children at the population level. However, it is not known whether having information about these experiences can accurately identify individual children at higher risk of depression. OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which experiencing parental IPV and/or maternal depression before age 12 years is associated with depression at age 18 years at the population and individual level. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a UK population-based birth cohort, which initially recruited pregnant mothers with estimated due dates in 1991 and 1992. Data used in this study were collected from 1991 to 2009. Data analysis was performed from February to March 2022. EXPOSURES: Mother-reported parental IPV was assessed on 8 occasions (child age, 1-11 years). Maternal depression was assessed via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale or by the mother taking medication for depression, as reported by the mother on 8 occasions (child age, 2-12 years). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Depressive symptoms were measured with the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) and Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) when the child was aged 18 years. Binary indicators of a case of depression were derived the cutoff point of 11 points or above for the SMFQ and 12 points or above for the CIS-R. RESULTS: The study included 5029 children (2862 girls [56.9%]; 2167 boys [43.1%]) with a measure of depressive symptoms at age 18 years. IPV only was associated with a 24% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.97-1.59) higher risk of depression at age 18 years, exposure to maternal depression only was associated with a 35% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.11-1.64) higher risk, and exposure to both IPV and maternal depression was associated with a 68% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.34-2.10) higher risk. At the individual level, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.55-0.60) for depression according to the SMFQ and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.55-0.62) for the CIS-R, indicating a 58% to 59% probability (ie, 8%-9% above chance) that a random participant with depression at age 18 years had been exposed to IPV and/or maternal depression compared with a random participant who did not have depression. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, parental IPV and maternal depression were associated with depression in adolescence at the population level. However, estimation of an individual developing depression in adolescence based only on information about IPV or maternal depression is poor. Screening children for maternal depression and IPV to target interventions to prevent adolescent depression will fail to identify many children who might benefit and may unnecessarily target many others who do not develop depression.",

However, it is also involved in the maturation of another 11 or 12 proteins that play different roles, encompassing in particular the modulation of the calcification of connective tissues. Since this process is physiologically needed in bones, but is pathological in arteries, a great deal of research has been devoted to finding a possible link between vitamin K and the prevention of osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, the current knowledge does not allow us to make a decisive conclusion about such a link. One possible explanation for this is the diversity of the biological activity of vitamin K, which is not a single compound but a general term covering natural plant and animal forms of vitamin K (K1 and K2) as well as their synthetic congeners (K3 and K4). Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) is found in several vegetables. Menaquinones (MK4-MK13, a series of compounds known as vitamin K2) are mostly of a bacterial origin and are introduced into the human diet mainly through fermented cheeses.

METHOD: Patients were recruited from the department of surgery in a large medical center in Taiwan. In this longitudinal pilot study, the Fatigue Symptom Inventory and fasting blood samples were collected at three assessments (i.e., prior to surgery (T0), three months (T1) and six months (T2) after surgery). Metabolomic profile analysis was used. Multilevel regression and pathway analyses were performed to identify differences in metabolomic profiles between the fatigued and non-fatigued groups. RESULTS: Of the 49 patients, 55.1% (n\u00a0=\u00a027) were in the fatigue group. All of the 15 metabolites that had statistically significant group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interactions in the differential metabolite analysis were entered into the pathway analysis. Two pathways were enriched for these metabolites, namely galactose metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this pilot study suggest that pathways involved in galactose metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis are associated with cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with CRC during CTX. These findings are consistent with the hypotheses that alterations in energy metabolism and increases in inflammation are associated with the development and maintenance of CRF.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mortality rate for children with septic shock is stil quite high in low-income and middle-income countries (31.7%). One of the most widely used scoring systems to assess mortality in sepsis or septic shock is Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD-2). However, it requires various laboratory evaluations. A non-invasive, fast and easy method is needed to assess the mortality of children with septic shock at an early stage. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the ability of Vascular Reactivity Index (VRI) compared with PELOD-2 score as a predictor of mortality in children with septic shock based on vascular response to vasoactive agents. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from children aged 1\u2009month to 18 years with septic shock treated in the ER and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the tertiary hospital from 2017 to 2021. The serial haemodynamic data were analysed including Systemic Vascular Resistant Index (SVRI) and the cardiac index from ultrasound cardiac output monitoring device was recorded in the first and sixth hours after the diagnosis of septic shock. The VRI was determined by dividing SVRI/Vasoactive Inotropic Score (ie, accumulated doses of dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, milrinone, vasopressin and norepinephrine). The receiver operating curve was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off point. RESULTS: A total of 68 subjects fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the median age was 54 months with a range of 2-204 months and the mortality rate was 47%. The majority of the patients who died were found in the high cardiac index and low SVRI group (17.6%). Moreover, the optimum cut-off point of VRI was obtained to predict mortality in septic shock of 32.1, with 87.5% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. The AUC for predicting death using VRI was 95% (95% CI 90% to 100%, p<0.001) and PELOD-2 92.6% (95% CI 96.4% to 98.8%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The VRI <32.1\u2009may potentially be used to predict mortality in children with septic shock and its predictive ability is as good as PELOD-2. The assessment of VRI is faster and easier than PELOD-2.",

        "abstract": "Current research on personality disorders strives to identify key behavioural and cognitive facets of patient functioning, to unravel the underlying root causes and maintenance mechanisms. This process often involves the application of social paradigms - however, these often only include momentary affective depictions rather than unfolding interactions. This constitutes a limitation in our capacity to probe core symptoms, and leaves potential findings uncovered which could help those who are in close relationships with affected individuals. Here, we deployed a novel task in which subjects interact with four unknown virtual partners in a turn-taking paradigm akin to a dance, and report on their experience with each. The virtual partners embody four combinations of low/high expressivity of positive/negative mood. Higher scores on our symptomatic measures of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were all linked to a general negative appraisal of all the interpersonal experiences. Moreover, the negative appraisal of the partner who displayed a high negative/low positive mood was tied with attachment anxiety and BPD symptoms. The extent to which subjects felt responsible for causing partners' distress was most strongly linked to attachment anxiety. Finally, we provide a fully-fledged exploration of move-by-move action latencies and click distances from partners. This analysis underscored slower movement initiation from anxiously attached individuals throughout all virtual interactions. In summary, we describe a novel paradigm for second-person neuroscience, which allowed both the replication of established results and the capture of new behavioural signatures associated with attachment anxiety, and discuss its limitations.",

        "title": "Modifying effects of prenatal exposure to rare earth elements on birth outcomes through maternal thyroid function in early pregnancy.",
        "abstract": "The potential health effects of exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) remain largely unexplored. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "title": "Intimate partner violence and maternal health services utilization: evidence from 36 National Household Surveys.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High rates of maternal mortality and intimate partner violence (IPV) are both major worldwide health challenges. Evidence from single-country samples suggests that IPV may be an important risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services, but there is little large-scale evidence on this association. This paper evaluates whether IPV is a risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services in a large cross-country sample, and also compiles evidence on the relative effects of different forms of IPV. METHODS: We analyze the association between intimate partner violence\u00a0and utilization of maternal health care, using a dataset compiling all Demographic and Health Surveys that report data on intimate partner violence. Using data on 166,685 women observed in 36 countries between 2005 and 2016, we estimate logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between lifetime experience of IPV and utilization of antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery care, and postnatal care. We estimate both unadjusted models and models adjusted for geographic and sociodemographic characteristics that are generally correlated with utilization of maternal health care (including age, education, number of children, wealth status, marital status, and urbanity). RESULTS: Lifetime experience of any IPV is associated with decreased use of maternal health services in a broad sample of births observed in lower and middle-income countries: in particular, the utilization of four or more ANC visits, the number of ANC visits, and the utilization of facility care at birth. This association remains statistically significant even after adjusting for country of residence, subnational region of residence, and additional individual-level covariates; however, there is no statistically significant association between experience of any IPV and postnatal care. The only form of IPV significantly associated with care utilization is physical IPV. CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing physical intimate partner violence show lower levels of utilization of maternal health services in a large sample of developing and middle-income countries. Given that reduced utilization of maternal health services is correlated with maternal and neonatal health outcomes, this pattern suggests that IPV prevention may be an important component of interventions targeting enhanced maternal and neonatal health.",

        "abstract": "Human livelihood highly depends on applying different sources of energy whose utilization is associated with air pollution. On the other hand, air pollution may be associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Unlike other environmental causes of cancer (e.g., irradiation), air pollution cannot efficiently be controlled by geographical borders, regulations, and policies. The unavoidable exposure to air pollution can modify cancer incidence and mortality. GBM treatment with chemotherapy or even its surgical removal has proven insufficient (100% recurrence rate; patient's survival mean of 15 months; 90% fatality within five years) due to glioma infiltrative and migratory capacities. Given the barrage of attention and research investments currently plowed into next-generation cancer therapy, oncolytic viruses are perhaps the most vigorously pursued. Provision of an insight into the current state of the research and future direction is essential for stimulating new ideas with the potentials of filling research gaps. This review manuscript aims to overview types of brain cancer, their burden, and different causative agents. It also describes why air pollution is becoming a concerning factor. The different opinions on the association of air pollution with brain cancer are reviewed. It tries to address the significant controversy in this field by hypothesizing the air-pollution-brain-cancer association via inflammation and atopic conditions. The last section of this review deals with the oncolytic viruses, which have been used in, or are still under clinical trials for GBM treatment. Engineered adenoviruses (i.e., DNX-2401, DNX-2440, CRAd8-S-pk7 loaded Neural stem cells), herpes simplex virus type 1 (i.e., HSV-1 C134, HSV-1 rQNestin34.5v.2, HSV-1 G207, HSV-1 M032), measles virus (i.e., MV-CEA), parvovirus (i.e., ParvOryx), poliovirus (i.e., Poliovirus PVSRIPO), reovirus (i.e., pelareorep), moloney murine leukemia virus (i.e., Toca 511 vector), and vaccinia virus (i.e., vaccinia virus TG6002) as possible life-changing alleviations for GBM have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first review that comprehensively discusses both (i) the negative/positive association of air pollution with GBM; and (ii) the application of oncolytic viruses for GBM, including the most recent advances and clinical trials. It is also the first review that addresses the controversies over air pollution and brain cancer association. We believe that the article will significantly appeal to a broad readership of virologists, oncologists, neurologists, environmentalists, and those who work in the field of (bio)energy. Policymakers may also use it to establish better health policies and regulations about air pollution and (bio)fuels exploration, production, and consumption.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence is a prevalent public health issue associated with all-cause maternal mortality. This study investigated the relationship between intimate partner violence, severe acute maternal morbidity in the intensive care unit (ICU), and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study in a hospital in Lima, Peru, with 109 cases (maternal ICU admissions) and 109 controls (obstetric patients not admitted to the ICU). Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and medical record review. Partner violence was assessed using the World Health Organization instrument. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the association between intimate partner violence and severe acute maternal morbidity. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher rate of intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy among cases (58.7%) than controls (27.5%). In multivariate analysis, intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy (aOR 3.83 (95% CI: 1.99-7.37)), being married (3.86 (1.27-11.73)), having <8 antenatal care visits (2.78 (1.14-6.80)), and having previous abortions (miscarriage, therapeutic, or unsafe) (1.69 (1.13-2.51)) were significantly associated with severe acute maternal morbidity. The ICU admission rate was 18.8 (per 1000 live births), and ICU maternal mortality was 1.7%. The perinatal mortality rate was higher in cases (9.3%) than in controls (1.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Intimate partner violence was associated with an increased risk of severe acute maternal morbidity. This suggests a more severe impact of intimate partner violence on pregnancy than has been previously identified.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: To determine if a set of time-varying biological indicators can be used to: 1) predict the sepsis mortality risk over time and 2) generate mortality risk profiles. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Nine Canadian ICUs. SUBJECTS: Three-hundred fifty-six septic patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical data and plasma levels of biomarkers were collected longitudinally. We used a complementary log-log model to account for the daily mortality risk of each patient until death in ICU/hospital, discharge, or 28 days after admission. The model, which is a versatile version of the Cox model for gaining longitudinal insights, created a composite indicator (the daily hazard of dying) from the \"day 1\" and \"change\" variables of six time-varying biological indicators (cell-free DNA, protein C, platelet count, creatinine, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and lactate) and a set of contextual variables (age, presence of chronic lung disease or previous brain injury, and duration of stay), achieving a high predictive power (conventional area under the curve, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94). Including change variables avoided misleading inferences about the effects of day 1 variables, signifying the importance of the longitudinal approach. We then generated mortality risk profiles that highlight the relative contributions among the time-varying biological indicators to overall mortality risk. The tool was validated in 28 nonseptic patients from the same ICUs who became septic later and was subject to 10-fold cross-validation, achieving similarly high area under the curve. CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel version of the Cox model, we created a prognostic tool for septic patients that yields not only a predicted probability of dying but also a mortality risk profile that reveals how six time-varying biological indicators differentially and longitudinally account for the patient's overall daily mortality risk.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess Gram-positive bacterial (GPB) bloodstream infection (BSI) in neonates, covering incidence, morbidity, mortality, antimicrobial resistance patterns and biomarkers in Region Stockholm, Sweden between 2006 and 2016. METHODS: A population-based retrospective epidemiological study including infants with GPB-BSI, admitted to the neonatal units at Karolinska University Hospital (KUH). Data were collected from patient records, the Swedish Neonatal Quality Register, the microbiological laboratory at KUH and the Swedish Public Health Agency. RESULTS: We identified 357 infants with GPB-BSI, representing an incidence of 1.47/1000 live births (LB). Group B streptococcus (GBS) was the most common pathogen causing BSI in full-term infants and early-onset sepsis (EOS) (0.20/1000 LB), while coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were predominant in infants born very preterm and in late-onset sepsis (LOS) (0.79/1000 LB). There were no fatal GBS BSI cases, but 10.2% developed meningitis. The GPB case fatality rate was 9.5% and the sepsis fatality rate 2.8%. In GPB-BSI, 1/10 did not have an elevated C-reactive protein level. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) BSI increased during the study period, but no methicillin or vancomycin resistant strains were found. The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rate was highest in CoNS isolates. CONCLUSION: GPB-BSI was four times more common than Gram-negative BSI in neonates but resulted in lower mortality rate. GBS was the most common pathogen in full-term infants and in EOS. CoNS was the most common pathogen in LOS and infants born very preterm, and the AMR rate was high in these isolates. The increasing trend of S. aureus BSI indicates a need of further investigation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Between 1990 and the mid-2010s, France registered a sharp rise in the spread and consumption of cannabis. At the same time, there has been an increase in the concentration of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol contained in cannabis. The aims of our study are to measure addictive and psychiatric comorbidities in cannabis users in France, and to compare characteristics between women and men. METHODS: Three hundred and forty-two\u00a0heavy cannabis users seen in a cannabis clinic between 2004 and 2014 were assessed during a 2-h clinical interview (DSM-IV, MINI). RESULTS: 83.2% of users are currently cannabis dependent, 10.6% alcohol dependent, and 2.1% cocaine/crack dependent. 37.8% have a current mood disorder, 47.6% have a current anxiety disorder, and 8.8% are psychotic. Women suffer significantly more often than men from major depressive episodes, dysthymia, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), both current and lifetime. Logistic regression shows that women have a significantly higher risk than men of suffering from PTSD over their lifetime (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20095.48; p\u2009<\u200910 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: French women heavy cannabis users are particularly at risk of PTSD\u00a0and are more likely than men to be dependent despite consuming fewer.

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cannabis use has been the most commonly used illicit psychoactive substance in India. Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Drug abuse is common among patients with mental disorder. The use of cannabis is likely to be associated with mental-health issues. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among cannabis user in engineering college and associated demographic factors. METHODS: In this study, 100 cannabis-consuming engineering students of (XXX) were selected by snowball sampling. After confirmation of cannabis use and individual selection according to DSM-5 criteria, Beck anxiety and depression inventories were used to access prevalence and severity of anxiety and depression among the participants. Demographic information such as age, gender, education and town of residence were also filled in a research questionnaire for analysis. RESULTS: The overall frequency of people with anxiety in the population of cannabis users was 60% and the overall frequency of people with depression was 33%. The frequency of cannabis users was highest in the age range of 24-25, in men and participants with diploma. The prevalence and severity of anxiety and depression was not significantly associated with age, gender, education and town of residence among the participants, p\u00a0>\u00a00.05. CONCLUSION: Due to the higher frequency of anxiety and depression disorders in cannabis users in this study compared to the general population, cannabis use is likely to be associated with anxiety and depression.",

        "title": "Oncolytic viruses as a promising therapeutic strategy against the detrimental health impacts of air pollution: The case of glioblastoma multiforme.",
        "abstract": "Human livelihood highly depends on applying different sources of energy whose utilization is associated with air pollution. On the other hand, air pollution may be associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Unlike other environmental causes of cancer (e.g., irradiation), air pollution cannot efficiently be controlled by geographical borders, regulations, and policies. The unavoidable exposure to air pollution can modify cancer incidence and mortality. GBM treatment with chemotherapy or even its surgical removal has proven insufficient (100% recurrence rate; patient's survival mean of 15 months; 90% fatality within five years) due to glioma infiltrative and migratory capacities. Given the barrage of attention and research investments currently plowed into next-generation cancer therapy, oncolytic viruses are perhaps the most vigorously pursued. Provision of an insight into the current state of the research and future direction is essential for stimulating new ideas with the potentials of filling research gaps. This review manuscript aims to overview types of brain cancer, their burden, and different causative agents. It also describes why air pollution is becoming a concerning factor. The different opinions on the association of air pollution with brain cancer are reviewed. It tries to address the significant controversy in this field by hypothesizing the air-pollution-brain-cancer association via inflammation and atopic conditions. The last section of this review deals with the oncolytic viruses, which have been used in, or are still under clinical trials for GBM treatment. Engineered adenoviruses (i.e., DNX-2401, DNX-2440, CRAd8-S-pk7 loaded Neural stem cells), herpes simplex virus type 1 (i.e., HSV-1 C134, HSV-1 rQNestin34.5v.2, HSV-1 G207, HSV-1 M032), measles virus (i.e., MV-CEA), parvovirus (i.e., ParvOryx), poliovirus (i.e., Poliovirus PVSRIPO), reovirus (i.e., pelareorep), moloney murine leukemia virus (i.e., Toca 511 vector), and vaccinia virus (i.e., vaccinia virus TG6002) as possible life-changing alleviations for GBM have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first review that comprehensively discusses both (i) the negative/positive association of air pollution with GBM; and (ii) the application of oncolytic viruses for GBM, including the most recent advances and clinical trials. It is also the first review that addresses the controversies over air pollution and brain cancer association. We believe that the article will significantly appeal to a broad readership of virologists, oncologists, neurologists, environmentalists, and those who work in the field of (bio)energy. Policymakers may also use it to establish better health policies and regulations about air pollution and (bio)fuels exploration, production, and consumption.",

        "abstract": "Cannabis is one of the most commonly used and abused illicit drugs in the world today. The United States (US) currently has the highest annual prevalence rate of cannabis consumption in the world, 17.9% in individuals aged 12 or older, and it is on the rise. With increasing cannabis use comes the potential for an increase in abuse, and according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), approximately 5.1% of Americans had Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) in 2020. Research has shown that genetics and epigenetics play a significant role in cannabis use and CUD. In fact, approximately 50-70% of liability to CUD and 40-48% of cannabis use initiation have been found to be the result of genetic factors. Cannabis usage and CUD have also been linked to an increased risk of psychiatric disorders and Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) subsets like schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. Comprehension of the genetic and epigenetic aspects of cannabinoids is necessary for future research, treatment plans, and the production of pure cannabinoid compounds, which will be essential for FDA approval. In conclusion, having a better understanding of the epigenetic and genetic underpinnings of cannabis use, CUD, and the endocannabinoid system as a whole will aid in the development of effective FDA-approved treatment therapies and the advancement of personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "Cannabis use and somatic consequences. Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit psychoactive substance in the world. It is perceived as a low-risk drug, as it is a plant, although many warnings in the medical literature underlined increased complications of cannabis use. Acute and chronic cannabis use is known to be harmful inducing psychiatric and addictive effects. An increase in the potency of cannabis as defined by a high ratio between the more important components, tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol has been observed for years, which leads to more serious complications. Evidence indicates that both acute and chronic consumptions of cannabis can be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Effects of cannabis use include mood disorders, exacerbation of psychotic disorders in vulnerable people, cannabis use disorders, withdrawal syndrome, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular and respiratory and other diseases. Synthetic cannabinoid has rapidly spread for the last few years; they are chemical substances inducing similar psychoactive effects to cannabis. Although, cannabis users call these substances \"cannabis\", synthetic cannabinoids have different pharmacological properties, which make them dangerous substances leading to more serious complications. Physicians dealing with cannabis users should be aware of these differences between vegetal cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids. Complications somatiques du cannabis.

        "abstract": "France has been identified with one of the highest rates of cannabis consumption of Western European countries. Yet we lack data in medical students who are at risk of addictive behavior. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of cannabis consumption and cannabis use disorder (CUD) among French medical students and their association with psychotropic drug consumption and psychosocial factors. Medical students were recruited from 35 French universities of medicine through administration mailing lists and social networks, between December 2016 and May 2017. Cannabis consumption was self-declared by anonymous questionnaire and CUD was defined by a Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) score\u2009\u2265\u20093. 10,985 medical students with a mean age of 21.8\u00a0years (\u00b1\u20093.3) were included, 32% of which were men. Overall, 1642 [14.9 (14.3; 15.6)%] reported cannabis consumption and 622 [5.7 (5.2; 6.1)%] students were identified with CUD at screening. Men were at two-time higher risk of cannabis consumption and three-time higher risk of CUD (22.4% and 10.6% for men vs. 11.5% and 3.4%, respectively, for women). In multivariate analyses, men sex, alcohol use disorder, tobacco smoking, parents' divorce, and history of physical assault and lower rates of lower rates of\u2009\u2265\u200940 weekly worked hours were identified as common associated factors for cannabis consumption and CUD. Hypnotic consumption, psychiatric follow-up, and history of sexual assault were identified as factors associated specifically with CUD, suggesting that these factors were associated with more severe cannabis consumption. Only 17% of students identified with CUD reported a psychiatric follow-up. Altogether, these results suggest that health policies should target cannabis consumption in medical students that is frequent, especially in men, with low rates of psychiatric follow-up. We have identified psychological factors and increased hypnotic drug consumption in CUD participants suggesting that psychiatric follow-up should be systematically proposed to this group.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is unmet need for male contraceptive options, but a recent injectable combination male contraceptive trial was terminated early due to adverse events (AEs). METHODS: We examined the frequency of reported AEs by male research participants compared with AEs reported in prescribing information of approved female hormonal contraceptive methods. Published data from trials of the top five most-used female hormonal contraceptives, supplemented by contemporary contraceptive research, were compared with the frequency of AEs reported in a male injectable hormonal contraceptive trial. RESULTS: We observed similar frequencies of AEs reported by users of male contraceptives compared with those reported by female users. Among quantitatively comparable AEs, compared with men, women reported experiencing higher frequencies of headaches, pelvic pain, and weight gain and similar frequencies of decreased libido. Compared with women, men reported experiencing higher frequencies of acne and mood changes. Men discontinued participation due to AEs at a lower frequency than women. CONCLUSIONS: Female hormonal methods generally have similar frequencies of AEs to those reported in a recent male hormonal contraceptive trial, and male users had lower rates of discontinuation due to AEs. There were fewer serious AEs of the male contraceptive than reported in contemporary female trials which resulted in FDA licensure. This suggests there may be implicit bias in the scientific community regarding the level of acceptable risk for users of male contraceptive methods.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death among women with nonmetastatic breast cancer. Whether exercise is associated with reductions in CVD risk in patients with breast cancer with an elevated CVD risk phenotype is not known. METHODS: Using a prospective design, women (n = 2,973; mean age, 57 years) diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer participating in two registry-based, regional cohort studies, completed a questionnaire that assessed leisure-time recreational physical activity (metabolic equivalent task [MET]-h/wk). The primary end point was the first occurrence of any of the following: new diagnosis of coronary artery disease, heart failure, valve abnormality, arrhythmia, stroke, or CVD death, occurring after study enrollment. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 8.6 years (range, 0.2 to 14.8 years). In multivariable analysis, the incidence of cardiovascular events decreased across increasing total MET-h/wk categories (Ptrend < .001). Compared with < 2 MET-h/wk, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.09) for 2 to 10.9 MET-h/wk, 0.79 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.96) for 11 to 24.5 MET-h/wk, and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.80) for \u2265 24.5 MET-h/wk. Similar trends were observed for the incidence of coronary artery disease and heart failure (P values < .05). Adherence to national exercise guidelines for adult patients with cancer (ie, \u2265 9 MET-h/wk) was associated with an adjusted 23% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events in comparison with not meeting the guidelines (< 9 MET-h/wk; P < .001). The association with exercise did not differ according to age, CVD risk factors, menopausal status, or anticancer treatment. CONCLUSION: Exercise is associated with substantial, graded reductions in the incidence of cardiovascular events in women with nonmetastatic breast cancer.",

The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

        "abstract": "The potential health effects of exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) remain largely unexplored. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety problems are common in children, yet few affected children access evidence-based treatment. Digitally augmented psychological therapies bring potential to increase availability of effective help for children with mental health problems. This study aimed to establish whether therapist-supported, digitally augmented, parent-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could increase the efficiency of treatment without compromising clinical effectiveness and acceptability. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, unblinded, two-arm, multisite, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapist-supported, parent-led CBT using the Online Support and Intervention (OSI) for child anxiety platform compared with treatment as usual for child (aged 5-12 years) anxiety problems in 34 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in England and Northern Ireland. We examined acceptability of OSI plus therapist support via qualitative interviews. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OSI plus therapist support or treatment as usual, minimised by child age, gender, service type, and baseline child anxiety interference. Outcomes were assessed at week 14 and week 26 after randomisation. The primary clinical outcome was parent-reported interference caused by child anxiety at week 26 assessment, using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale-parent report (CAIS-P). The primary measure of health economic effect was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Outcome analyses were conducted blind in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with a standardised non-inferiority margin of 0\u00b733 for clinical analyses. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, 12890382. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2020, and Aug 3, 2022, 706 families (706 children and their parents or carers) were referred to the study information. 444 families were enrolled. Parents reported 255 (58%) child participants' gender to be female, 184 (41%) male, three (<1%) other, and one (<1%) preferred not to report their child's gender. 400 (90%) children were White and the mean age was 9\u00b720 years (SD 1\u00b779). 85% of families for whom clinicians provided information in the treatment as usual group received CBT. OSI plus therapist support was non-inferior for parent-reported anxiety interference on the CAIS-P (SMD 0\u00b701, 95% CI -0\u00b715 to 0\u00b717; p<0\u00b70001) and all secondary outcomes. The mean difference in QALYs across trial arms approximated to zero, and OSI plus therapist support was associated with lower costs than treatment as usual. OSI plus therapist support was likely to be cost effective under certain scenarios, but uncertainty was high. OSI plus therapist support acceptability was good. No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Digitally augmented intervention brought promising savings without compromising outcomes and as such presents a valuable tool for increasing access to psychological therapies and meeting the demand for treatment of child anxiety problems.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms \"sepsis,\" \"septicemia,\" or \"septic shock\" in the title or abstract. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Strong associations of several markers of organ dysfunction with the outcomes of interest among infected and septic children support their inclusion in the data validation phase of the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce.",

        "abstract": "Dependency on digital devices resulting in an ever-increasing daily screen time has subsequently also been the cause of several adverse effects on physical and mental or psychological health. Constant exposure to devices like smartphones, personal computers, and television can severely affect mental health- increase stress and anxiety, for example, and cause various sleep issues in both children as well as adults. Risk factors for obesity and cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, poor regulation of stress, low HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance are among the physical health repercussions we see. The psychological health effects comprise suicidal tendencies and symptoms of depression which are associated with digital device dependency, screen-time-induced poor sleep quality, and content-influenced negativity. Oftentimes it can cause the induction of a state of hyper-arousal, increase stress hormones, desynchronize the body clock or the circadian cycle, alter brain chemistry and create a drag on mental energy and development. With a focus on brain development in children and detrimental effects in both adults and children, this research article goes on to explore the various aspects of screen addiction and excessive screen exposure.",

METHODS: Single-center, retrospective cohort study in children with a diagnosis of sepsis visiting the PED and then admitted to the PICU from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019. Sepsis organ dysfunction scores-pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) (Schlapbach, Matics, Shime), quickSOFA, quickSOFA-L, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD)-2, quickPELOD-2, and Pediatric Multiple Organ Dysfunction score-were calculated during the first 24 hours of admission (day 1) and their performance compared with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and severe sepsis-International Consensus Conference on Pediatric Sepsis(ICCPS)-derived criteria-using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Primary outcome was PICU mortality. Secondary outcomes were: a composite of death and new disability (ie, change from baseline Pediatric Overall Performance Category score \u22651); prolonged PICU length of stay (>5 d); prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) (>3 d). RESULTS: Among 60 patients with sepsis, 4 (6.7%) died, 7 (11.7%) developed new disability, 26 (43.3%) experienced prolonged length of stay, and 21 (35%) prolonged invasive MV. The prognostic ability in mortality discrimination was significantly higher for organ dysfunction scores, with PELOD-2 showing the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.924; 95% confidence interval, 0.837-1.000), significantly better than SIRS 3 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P = 0.009), SIRS 4 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P < 0.001), and severe sepsis (0.924 vs 0.527, P < 0.001). Among secondary outcomes, PELOD-2 performed significantly better than SIRS criteria and severe sepsis to predict prolonged duration of invasive MV, whereas better than severe sepsis to predict \"poor outcome\" (mortality or new disability). CONCLUSIONS: Day 1 organ dysfunction scores performed better in predicting mortality and morbidity outcomes than ICCPS-derived criteria. The PELOD-2 was the organ dysfunction score with the best performance for all outcomes.",

Given its importance in terms of morbidity and mortality, a number of initiatives by several professional societies in recent years have led to the development of guidelines for the recognition and timely management of sepsis. The principal elements of the most recent guidelines are summarized in this practice point. These elements include recognition of changes in clinical condition and vital signs, such as fever, tachycardia, and changes in peripheral perfusion, which should raise concern for sepsis; initial stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation; timely administration of empiric antimicrobial therapy; use of fluid boluses and vasoactive medications; and specific considerations in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as the use of corticosteroids for possible adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic-adrenal suppression. Two changes from previous guidelines are the concern for fluid overload, implying the need for clinical re-assessment after administration of each fluid bolus, and the removal of dopamine as the initial vasoactive agent for use in hypotensive paediatric patients, with recommendations for the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine as dictated by the clinical context.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is unmet need for male contraceptive options, but a recent injectable combination male contraceptive trial was terminated early due to adverse events (AEs). METHODS: We examined the frequency of reported AEs by male research participants compared with AEs reported in prescribing information of approved female hormonal contraceptive methods. Published data from trials of the top five most-used female hormonal contraceptives, supplemented by contemporary contraceptive research, were compared with the frequency of AEs reported in a male injectable hormonal contraceptive trial. RESULTS: We observed similar frequencies of AEs reported by users of male contraceptives compared with those reported by female users. Among quantitatively comparable AEs, compared with men, women reported experiencing higher frequencies of headaches, pelvic pain, and weight gain and similar frequencies of decreased libido. Compared with women, men reported experiencing higher frequencies of acne and mood changes. Men discontinued participation due to AEs at a lower frequency than women. CONCLUSIONS: Female hormonal methods generally have similar frequencies of AEs to those reported in a recent male hormonal contraceptive trial, and male users had lower rates of discontinuation due to AEs. There were fewer serious AEs of the male contraceptive than reported in contemporary female trials which resulted in FDA licensure. This suggests there may be implicit bias in the scientific community regarding the level of acceptable risk for users of male contraceptive methods.",

This study investigated the relationship between intimate partner violence, severe acute maternal morbidity in the intensive care unit (ICU), and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study in a hospital in Lima, Peru, with 109 cases (maternal ICU admissions) and 109 controls (obstetric patients not admitted to the ICU). Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and medical record review. Partner violence was assessed using the World Health Organization instrument. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the association between intimate partner violence and severe acute maternal morbidity. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher rate of intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy among cases (58.7%) than controls (27.5%). In multivariate analysis, intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy (aOR 3.83 (95% CI: 1.99-7.37)), being married (3.86 (1.27-11.73)), having <8 antenatal care visits (2.78 (1.14-6.80)), and having previous abortions (miscarriage, therapeutic, or unsafe) (1.69 (1.13-2.51)) were significantly associated with severe acute maternal morbidity. The ICU admission rate was 18.8 (per 1000 live births), and ICU maternal mortality was 1.7%. The perinatal mortality rate was higher in cases (9.3%) than in controls (1.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Intimate partner violence was associated with an increased risk of severe acute maternal morbidity. This suggests a more severe impact of intimate partner violence on pregnancy than has been previously identified. Inquiring about intimate partner violence during prenatal visits may prevent further harm to the mother-baby dyad.",

We compared the effectiveness and safety of pharmacopuncture and physiotherapy for AC. METHODS: This pragmatic, randomized, controlled, parallel-group pilot study enrolled patients with limitations of shoulder movement and a numeric rating scale (NRS) score for shoulder pain \u22655 randomized (1:1) to the pharmacopuncture therapy (PPT) and physiotherapy (PT) groups. Treatment sessions were administered twice weekly for 6 weeks, and the participants were followed up for 13 weeks after randomization. The primary outcome was the NRS score for shoulder pain, and the secondary outcomes were the visual analog scale (VAS), Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), range of motion (ROM), patient global impression of change (PGIC), EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), and Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12) scores. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was set as the primary analysis. RESULTS: Among 50 participants, for the primary endpoint (week 7) the PPT group showed a significantly superior improvement in NRS, VAS, SPADI, ROM for flexion, ROM for abduction, and EQ-5D-5L scores. The ROM for extension, ROM for adduction, physical component summary, and patient global impression of change were significantly better in the PPT than in the PT group, and these effects were sustained until week 13.

        "abstract": "Analytic morphomics refers to the accurate measurement of specific biological markers of human body composition in diagnostic medical imaging. The increasing prevalence of disease processes that alter body composition including obesity, cachexia, and sarcopenia has generated interest in specific targeted measurement of these metrics to possibly prevent or reduce negative health outcomes. Typical morphomic measurements include the area and density of muscle, bone, vascular calcification, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat on a specific validated axial level in the patient's cross-sectional diagnostic imaging. A distinct advantage of these measurements is that they can be made retrospectively and opportunistically with pre-existing datasets. We provide a narrative review of the current state of art in morphomics, but also consider some potential future directions for this exciting field. Imaging based quantitative assessment of body composition has enormous potential across the breadth and scope of modern clinical practice. From risk stratification to treatment planning, and outcome assessment, all can be enhanced with the use of analytic morphomics. Moreover, it is likely that many new opportunities for personalized medicine will emerge as the field evolves.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. There is a paucity of data on the criteria used to define sepsis and septic shock and predict mortality. Schlapbach et al. published Phoenix criteria to define sepsis in JAMA in 2024. Previously, paediatricians have used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, but these criteria lack sensitivity and specificity. This group recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Though included in the 8-point criteria, important criteria like renal and liver are missing from the main criteria. We remain worried about the way these criteria got excluded from the main criteria. Therefore, in this brief report, whilst commending the authors for this stelar task, we highlight the main pitfalls in these criteria especially the renal, neurologic, and liver criteria. These criteria have been shown to be independently associated with outcomes, and we recommend that in the future iterations of the criteria, renal and liver criteria should be defined according to latest definitions and the task force consider utilizing latest criteria for each organ system involved within the formulated criteria. CONCLUSION: \u00a0In conclusion, Phoenix criteria are a step in the right direction to define life-threatening organ dysfunction in sepsis, but clinicians need to be mindful that diagnosis/treatment of less severe sepsis should not be delayed if these criteria are not met. Therefore, local early detection and management tools for sepsis should be followed. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 There has always been a quest for a definition for pediatric sepsis. There are limitations to the previous pediatric sepsis criteria which were published in 2005 by the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC). IPSCC defines sepsis as a suspected or confirmed infection in the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). These new Phoenix Pediatric Sepsis (PPS) criteria for sepsis and septic shock are intended to identify children with life-threatening organ dysfunction due to infection, and the score was developed based on a very large pediatric dataset. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022 Though the intention of Phoenix criteria is to help identify children with life threatening organ dysfunction, unfortunately the crietria will miss signs of early sepis. In this manuscript, we point out some of the drawbacks of these criteria which need to be borne in mind while applying these criteria.",

Treatment with tofersen likely slows progression in this form of inherited ALS, though longer duration studies would likely be needed to demonstrate this effect.",

        "title": "Identification and validation of a novel four-gene diagnostic model for neonatal early-onset sepsis with bacterial infection.",
        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method. The model has better diagnostic performance compared with conventional inflammatory indicators such as CRP, Hb, NEU%, and PCT.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that embryo donation can be a successful treatment for infertile couples,<br />however the willingness of Dutch couples to donate or accept embryos was unknown. The aim of this article is to<br />describe the protocol and results for altruistic embryo donation of the only embryo bank in the Netherlands.<br />Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive study. Since 2011, donated cryo-embryos from couples that have undergone<br />in vitro-fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) treatments, are being stored in our embryo<br />bank. The majority of the donated embryos were frozen on day 3 or 4 by slow freezing techniques. We perform a<br />thorough medical and psychological screening of donor couples and recipients, according to the protocol drawn up in<br />close collaboration with the Dutch Ministry of Health.<br />Results: Up to June 2021, 54 women have received embryos from our embryo bank, all single embryo transfers.<br />While the clinical pregnancy rate in 'unknown' embryo donations was relatively high (25.3%), the live birth rate<br />shows limited success (12.6%), partly due to high pregnancy loss through miscarriage. In known donation procedures,<br />the recipients tend to undergo more procedures, depending on the number of donated cryo-embryos. Twentyeight<br />women received embryos from known donors, with a clinical pregnancy rate per embryo transfer of 24%, and<br />live birth rate of 14%. In total, 82 recipients were granted donated cryo-embryos, twenty had an ongoing pregnancy<br />(24.4%), nineteen of whom have given birth to a healthy child (23%).<br />Conclusion: Altruistic embryo donation of embryos appears to be satisfying for the donors, as they are not obliged to destroy<br />their embryos, but instead help others build a family. Although success rates are still limited, partly due to the relatively high<br />miscarriage rates and inferior freezing techniques, to this date nineteen out of 82 recipients have given birth to a healthy child.",

        "title": "Vascular Reactivity Index and PELOD-2 as a mortality predictor in paediatric septic shock: a single-centre retrospective study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mortality rate for children with septic shock is stil quite high in low-income and middle-income countries (31.7%). One of the most widely used scoring systems to assess mortality in sepsis or septic shock is Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD-2). However, it requires various laboratory evaluations. A non-invasive, fast and easy method is needed to assess the mortality of children with septic shock at an early stage. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the ability of Vascular Reactivity Index (VRI) compared with PELOD-2 score as a predictor of mortality in children with septic shock based on vascular response to vasoactive agents. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from children aged 1\u2009month to 18 years with septic shock treated in the ER and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the tertiary hospital from 2017 to 2021. The serial haemodynamic data were analysed including Systemic Vascular Resistant Index (SVRI) and the cardiac index from ultrasound cardiac output monitoring device was recorded in the first and sixth hours after the diagnosis of septic shock. The VRI was determined by dividing SVRI/Vasoactive Inotropic Score (ie, accumulated doses of dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, milrinone, vasopressin and norepinephrine). The receiver operating curve was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off point. RESULTS: A total of 68 subjects fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the median age was 54 months with a range of 2-204 months and the mortality rate was 47%. The majority of the patients who died were found in the high cardiac index and low SVRI group (17.6%). Moreover, the optimum cut-off point of VRI was obtained to predict mortality in septic shock of 32.1, with 87.5% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. The AUC for predicting death using VRI was 95% (95% CI 90% to 100%, p<0.001) and PELOD-2 92.6% (95% CI 96.4% to 98.8%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The VRI <32.1\u2009may potentially be used to predict mortality in children with septic shock and its predictive ability is as good as PELOD-2. The assessment of VRI is faster and easier than PELOD-2.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis remains one of the leading causes of mortality in newborns. Several brainstem-regulated physiological processes undergo disruption during neonatal sepsis. Mechanistic knowledge gaps exist at the interplay between metabolism and immune activation to brainstem neural circuits and pertinent physiological functions in neonates. To delineate this association, we induced systemic inflammation either by TLR4 (LPS) or TLR1/2 (PAM3CSK4) ligand administration in postnatal day 5 mice (PD5). Our findings show that LPS and PAM3CSK4 evoke substantial changes in respiration and metabolism. Physiological trade-offs led to hypometabolic-hypothermic responses due to LPS, but not PAM3CSK4, whereas to both TLR ligands blunted respiratory chemoreflexes. Neuroinflammatory pathways modulation in brainstem showed more robust effects in LPS than PAM3CSK4. Brainstem neurons, microglia, and astrocyte gene expression analyses showed unique responses to TLR ligands. PAM3CSK4 did not significantly modulate gene expression changes in GLAST-1 positive brainstem astrocytes. PD5 pups receiving PAM3CSK4 failed to maintain a prolonged metabolic state repression, which correlated to enhanced gasping latency and impaired autoresuscitation during anoxic chemoreflex challenges. In contrast, LPS administered pups showed no significant changes in anoxic chemoreflex. Electrophysiological studies from brainstem slices prepared from pups exposed to either TLR4 or PAM3CSK4 showed compromised transmission between preB\u00f6tzinger complex and Hypoglossal as an exclusive response to the TLR1/2 ligand. Spatial gene expression analysis demonstrated a region-specific modulation of PAM3CSK4 within the raphe nucleus relative to other anatomical sites evaluated. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes due to inflammation might be a crucial tolerance mechanism for neonatal sepsis preserving neural control of breathing.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Previous studies applying Sepsis-3 criteria to children were based on retrospective analyses of PICU cohorts. We aimed to compare organ dysfunction criteria in children with blood culture-proven sepsis, including emergency department, PICU, and ward patients, and to assess relevance of organ dysfunctions for mortality prediction. DESIGN: We have carried out a nonprespecified, secondary analysis of a prospective dataset collected from September 2011 to December 2015. SETTING: Emergency departments, wards, and PICUs in 10 tertiary children's hospitals in Switzerland. PATIENTS: Children younger than 17 years old with blood culture-proven sepsis. We excluded preterm infants and term infants younger than 7 days old. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC), Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2), pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA), and Pediatric Organ Dysfunction Information Update Mandate (PODIUM) scores, measured at blood culture sampling, to predict 30-day mortality. We analyzed 877 sepsis episodes in 807 children, with a 30-day mortality of 4.3%. Percentage with organ dysfunction ranged from 32.7% (IPSCC) to 55.3% (pSOFA). In adjusted analyses, the accuracy for identification of 30-day mortality was area under the curve (AUC) 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82-0.92) for IPSCC, 0.83 (0.76-0.89) for PELOD-2, 0.85 (0.78-0.92) for pSOFA, and 0.85 (0.78-0.91) for PODIUM. When restricting scores to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction, the adjusted AUC was 0.89 (0.84-0.94) for IPSCC, 0.85 (0.79-0.91) for PELOD-2, 0.87 (0.81-0.93) for pSOFA, and 0.88 (0.83-0.93) for PODIUM. CONCLUSIONS: IPSCC, PELOD-2, pSOFA, and PODIUM performed similarly to predict 30-day mortality. Simplified scores restricted to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction yielded comparable performance.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms \"sepsis,\" \"septicemia,\" or \"septic shock\" in the title or abstract. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001).

Epidemiological data about sepsis from the 2017 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factor Study showed that the global burden of sepsis was greater than previously estimated. Bacteria have been shown to be the predominant pathogen of sepsis among patients with pathogens detected, while sepsis caused by viruses is underdiagnosed worldwide. The coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 in China and now in many other countries has brought viral sepsis back into the vision of physicians and researchers worldwide. Although the current understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis has improved, the differences between viral and bacterial sepsis at the level of pathophysiology are not well understood. Diagnosis methods that can broadly differentiate between bacterial and viral sepsis at the initial stage after the development of sepsis are limited.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency of primary multiple organ failure and the role of sepsis as a causative agent in critically ill pediatric patients; and calculate and evaluate the accuracy of the Pediatric Risk of Mortality III (PRISM III) and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) scores to predict the outcomes of critically ill children. METHODS: Retrospective study, which evaluated data from patients admitted from January to December 2011 in the pediatric intensive care unit of the Children's Hospital of the University of Cairo. RESULTS: Out of 237 patients in the study, 72% had multiple organ dysfunctions, and 45% had sepsis with multiple organ dysfunctions. The mortality rate in patients with multiple organ dysfunction was 73%. Independent risk factors for death were mechanical ventilation and neurological failure [OR: 36 and 3.3, respectively]. The PRISM III score was more accurate than the PELOD score in predicting death, with a Hosmer-Lemeshow X2 (Chi-square value) of 7.3 (df = 8, p = 0.5). The area under the curve was 0.723 for PRISM III and 0.78 for PELOD. CONCLUSION: A multiple organ dysfunctions was associated with high mortality. Sepsis was the major cause. Pneumonia, diarrhea and central nervous system infections were the major causes of sepsis. PRISM III had a better calibration than the PELOD for prognosis of the patients, despite the high frequency of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

OBJETIVO: Avaliar a frequ\u00eancia de fal\u00eancia de m\u00faltiplos \u00f3rg\u00e3os prim\u00e1ria e o papel da sepse como agente causal em pacientes pedi\u00e1tricos cr\u00edticos; e calcular e avaliar a precis\u00e3o dos escores  M\u00c9TODOS: Estudo retrospectivo, que avaliou dados de pacientes admitidos entre janeiro a dezembro de 2011 na unidade de terapia intensiva pedi\u00e1trica do  RESULTADOS: Dentre os 237 pacientes estudo, 72% tiveram fal\u00eancia de m\u00faltiplos \u00f3rg\u00e3os e 45% sepse com fal\u00eancia de m\u00faltiplos \u00f3rg\u00e3os. A taxa de mortalidade em pacientes com fal\u00eancia de m\u00faltiplos \u00f3rg\u00e3os foi de 73%. Os fatores independentes de risco para \u00f3bito foram ventila\u00e7\u00e3o mec\u00e2nica e fal\u00eancia neurol\u00f3gica (OR: 36 e 3,3, respectivamente). O PRISM III foi mais preciso para prever \u00f3bito, com qui quadrado no teste de Hosmer-Lemeshow de 7,3 (df = 8; p = 0,5). A \u00e1rea sob a curva foi de 0,723 para o PRISM III e de 0,78 para o PELOD. CONCLUS\u00c3O: A fal\u00eancia de m\u00faltiplos \u00f3rg\u00e3os esteve associada \u00e0 elevada mortalidade. A sepse foi sua principal causa. Pneumonia, diarreia e infec\u00e7\u00f5es do sistema nervoso central foram as principais causas de sepse. O PRISM III teve melhor calibra\u00e7\u00e3o do que o PELOD para progn\u00f3stico dos pacientes, apesar da elevada frequ\u00eancia da s\u00edndrome de fal\u00eancia de m\u00faltiplos \u00f3rg\u00e3os.",

        "abstract": "Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score is used as a predictor of outcome of sepsis in the pediatric intensive care unit. The aim of the study is to determine the application of SOFA scores as a predictor of outcome in children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with a diagnosis of sepsis. The design involved is prospective observational study. The study took place at the multidisciplinary pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), tertiary care hospital, South India. The patients included are children, aged 1 month to 18 years admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis (suspected/proven) to a single center PICU in India from November 2017 to November 2019. Data collected included the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome-related variables. Severity of illness scores was calculated to include SOFA score day 1 (SF1) and day 3 (SF3) using a pediatric version (pediatric SOFA score or pSOFA) with age-adjusted cutoff variables for organ dysfunction, pediatric risk of mortality III (PRISM III; within 24\u2009hours of admission), and pediatric logistic organ dysfunction-2 or PELOD-2 (days 1, 3, and 5). A total of 240 patients were admitted to the PICU with septic shock during the study period. The overall mortality rate was 42 of 240 patients (17.5%). The majority (59%) required mechanical ventilation, while only 19% required renal replacement therapy. The PRISM III, PELOD-2, and pSOFA scores correlated well with mortality. All three severity of illness scores were higher among nonsurvivors as compared with survivors ( ",

        "title": "Epidemiology and Immune Pathogenesis of Viral Sepsis.",
        "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can be caused by a broad range of pathogens; however, bacterial infections represent the majority of sepsis cases. Up to 42% of sepsis presentations are culture negative, suggesting a non-bacterial cause. Despite this, diagnosis of viral sepsis remains very rare. Almost any virus can cause sepsis in vulnerable patients (e.g., neonates, infants, and other immunosuppressed groups). The prevalence of viral sepsis is not known, nor is there enough information to make an accurate estimate. The initial standard of care for all cases of sepsis, even those that are subsequently proven to be culture negative, is the immediate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the absence of definite diagnostic criteria for viral sepsis, or at least to exclude bacterial sepsis, this inevitably leads to unnecessary antimicrobial use, with associated consequences for antimicrobial resistance, effects on the host microbiome and excess healthcare costs. It is important to understand non-bacterial causes of sepsis so that inappropriate treatment can be minimised, and appropriate treatments can be developed to improve outcomes. In this review, we summarise what is known about viral sepsis, its most common causes, and how the immune responses to severe viral infections can contribute to sepsis. We also discuss strategies to improve our understanding of viral sepsis, and ways we can integrate this new information into effective treatment.",
