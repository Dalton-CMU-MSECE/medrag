        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of childhood mortality. Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population. Taken together, we concluded that the IL-17 signaling pathway serves as a significant potential mechanism of sepsis and provides a promising therapeutic target for sepsis treatment. This research will further deepen our understanding of sepsis development.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This case-control study included 124 neonates with sepsis (88 survivors/36 non-survivors) admitted to the neonatal ICU and 17 healthy neonates. The relative expressions were quantified by real-time PCR and correlated to the clinic-laboratory data. RESULTS: The three circulating lncRNAs were upregulated in the cases; the median levels were MALAT1 (median = 1.71, IQR: -0.5 to 3.27), ANRIL (median = 1.09, IQR: 0.89 to 1.30), and HOTAIR (median = 1.83, IQR: 1.44 to 2.41).

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method. The model has better diagnostic performance compared with conventional inflammatory indicators such as CRP, Hb, NEU%, and PCT.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To study the metabolic mechanism of neonatal sepsis at different stages by analyzing the metabolic pathways involving the serum metabolites with significant differences in neonates with sepsis at different time points after admission. METHODS: A total of 20 neonates with sepsis who were hospitalized in the Department of Neonatology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, from January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2020 were enrolled as the sepsis group. Venous blood samples were collected on days 1, 4, and 7 after admission. Ten healthy neonates who underwent physical examination during the same period were enrolled as the control group. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for the metabonomic analysis of serum samples to investigate the change in metabolomics in neonates with sepsis at different time points. RESULTS: On day 1 after admission, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between the sepsis and control groups were mainly involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid skeleton. For the sepsis group, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 4 after admission were mainly involved in pyruvate metabolism, and those between days 4 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in the metabolism of cysteine and methionine. The differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in ascorbic acid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic mechanism of serum metabolites varies at different stages in neonates with sepsis and is mainly associated with terpenoid skeleton biosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism, cysteine/methionine metabolism, and ascorbic acid metabolism.

        "abstract": "According to the Third International Consensus Definition for Sepsis and Septic Shock, sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction resulting from dysregulated host responses to infection. Epidemiological data about sepsis from the 2017 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factor Study showed that the global burden of sepsis was greater than previously estimated. Bacteria have been shown to be the predominant pathogen of sepsis among patients with pathogens detected, while sepsis caused by viruses is underdiagnosed worldwide. The coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 in China and now in many other countries has brought viral sepsis back into the vision of physicians and researchers worldwide. Although the current understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis has improved, the differences between viral and bacterial sepsis at the level of pathophysiology are not well understood. Diagnosis methods that can broadly differentiate between bacterial and viral sepsis at the initial stage after the development of sepsis are limited. New treatments that can be applied at clinics for sepsis are scarce and this situation is not consistent with the growing understanding of pathophysiology.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms \"sepsis,\" \"septicemia,\" or \"septic shock\" in the title or abstract. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide expression profiles have been previously employed as clinical research diagnostic tools for newborn sepsis. We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

The varying microbiological pattern of sepsis warrants the need for researches on the causative organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. The epidemiology of neonatal and pediatric sepsis in Ethiopia is under-research. The objective of this study was to evaluate the burden of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among children suspected of sepsis. METHODS: An institutional-based prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 370 pediatric(age birth-15 years) patients suspected of sepsis at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized hospital from December 2020 to November 2021. Blood samples were collected aseptically and inoculated into Tryptone Soya Broth for culture. The organisms grown were identified by standard microbiological methods and subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing by modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method recommended by Clinical laboratory and standard institute. Methicillin resistance was confirmed using Cefoxitin disk diffusion method. Data entry and analysis were done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 software. A p-value less than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval was considered statically significant. RESULTS: Out of the total 370 study subjects, 21.6% (80/370) of them were culture positive. Of these, 43 (53.8%) and 37 (46.3%) were Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, respectively. The most prevalent Gram-positive bacterial isolate was Staphylococcus aureus (n\u2009=\u200924; 30%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (n\u2009=\u20097; 8.8%). Among the Gram-negative bacterial isolates, the leading bacteria was Klebsiella pneumoniae (n\u2009=\u200920; 25%) followed by Escherichia coli (n\u2009=\u20097; 8.8%). Clindamycin, Chloramphenicol, Gentamicin and Ciprofloxacin were the most effective antibiotics against Gram-positive bacterial isolates while Amikacin, Meropenem and Chloramphenicol were effective against Gram-negative pathogens. Methicillin resistance was detected in 45.8% of Staphylococcus aureus. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was observed in 76% of the bacterial isolates. CONCLUSION: Gram positive bacteria were the predominant isolates among pediatric sepsis cases and most of the bacterial isolates showed MDR. Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were frequently isolated bacteria. The high prevalence of drug resistance warrants rational use of antibiotics and the need for regular antibiotic susceptibility surveillance studies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cannabis use has been the most commonly used illicit psychoactive substance in India. Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.",

We included studies that assessed neonatal sepsis and the following outcomes; (1) change in the metabolism compared to healthy neonates and/or (2) metabolomics compared to traditional diagnostic tools of neonatal sepsis. The screened abstracts were independently considered for eligibility by two researchers. PROSPERO ID: CRD42020164454. RESULTS: The search identified in total 762 articles. Fifteen articles were assessed for eligibility. Four studies were included, with totally 78 neonates. The studies used different diagnostic criteria and had between 1 and 16 sepsis cases. All studies with bacterial sepsis found alterations in the glucose and lactate metabolism, reflecting possible redistribution of glucose consumption from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to the lactate and pentose phosphate pathway. We also found signs of increased oxidative stress and fatty acid oxidation in sepsis cases. CONCLUSION: We found signs of metabolomic signatures in neonatal sepsis. This may lead to better understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and detection of new candidate biomarkers. Results should be validated in large-scale multicentre studies.",

        "abstract": "Almost 50% of the infertility cases are due to male factors. Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) allow to overcome the incapacity of these patients' spermatozoa to fertilize the oocyte and produce a viable and healthy offspring, but the efficiency of the different techniques has still the potential to improve. According to the latest reports of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC), the percentages of deliveries per ART cycle in 2014 and 2016 were 21 and 22%, respectively. Among the reasons for this relatively low efficiency, the quality of the spermatozoa has been pointed out as critical, and the presence of high percentages of DNA-damaged spermatozoa in patients' ejaculates is possibly one of the main factors reducing the ARTs outcomes. Thus, one of the main challenges in reproductive medicine is to ensure the highest quality of the spermatozoa used in ARTs, and specifically, in terms of genetic integrity. The latest techniques for the preparation and selection of human spermatozoa are herein discussed focusing on those proven to improve one or several of the following parameters: sperm genetic integrity, fertilization capacity, embryo production, and ",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adolescence is crucial period for laying the foundations for healthy development and mental well-being. The increasing prevalence of mental disorders amongst adolescents makes promotion of mental well-being and prevention interventions at schools important. UPRIGHT (Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally implemented in schools to improve and promote mental Health for Teenagers) is designed as a whole school approach (school community, students and families) to promote a culture of mental well-being and prevent mental disorders by enhancing resilience capacities. The present article aims at describing the rationale, conceptual framework, as well as methodology of implementation and evaluation of the UPRIGHT intervention. METHODS: UPRIGHT project is a research and innovation project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement No. 754919 (Duration: 48\u2009months). The theoretical framework has been developed by an innovative and multidisciplinary approach using a co-creation process inside the UPRIGHT Consortium (involving seven institutions from Spain, Italy, Poland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland). Resulted is the UPRIGHT programme with 18 skills related to 4 components: Mindfulness, Coping, Efficacy and Social and Emotional Learning. Among the five Pan-European regions, 34 schools have been currently involved (17 control; 17 intervention) and around 6000 adolescents and their families are foreseen to participate along a 3-year period of evaluation. Effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated as a randomized controlled trial including quantitative and qualitative analysis in the five Pan-European regions representative of the cultural and socioeconomic diversity. The cost-effectiveness assessment will be performed by simulation modelling methods. DISCUSSION: We expect a short- to medium-term improvement of mental well-being in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities. The study may provide robust evidence on intrapersonal, familiar and social environmental resilience factors promoting positive mental well-being.

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition, occurring when an infectious agent invades the body, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2\u03bcg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin. Early detection of bacteria followed by antimicrobial susceptibility test can help by selection of appropriate antibiotic and prevent spread of infection.",

CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in the treatment of R/R childhood B-ALL, although the majority of reports have been in noninfant patients. Barriers to the successful implementation of CAR T-cell therapy in infant B-ALL include challenges related to apheresis, product manufacturing, and disease-specific considerations such as lineage switch. We describe our experience using 2 experimental CD19 CAR T-cell products, SCRI-CAR19 or SCRI-CAR19x22, for 19 patients with R/R infant B-ALL enrolled in 3 clinical trials. CAR T-cell products were successfully manufactured in 18 of 19 (94.7%) patients, with a median age of 22.5\u00a0months at enrollment (range, 14.5-40.1).

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The involvement of B-cells in multiple sclerosis has only recently emerged. Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the B-cell antigen CD20 with enhanced B-cell targeting. AREAS COVERED: This evaluation is of the identical ULTIMATE (UbLiTuximab In Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Effects) I and II trials comparing ublituximab (TG-1101) and teriflunomide in relapsing multiple sclerosis. The primary efficacy end point was the annualized relapse rate and was lower in the ublituximab than the teriflunomide group. EXPERT OPINION: The continuation rates to oral teriflunomide in ULTIMATE were higher than in other trials, possibly because of the supervised double-dummy protocol used with intravenous ublituximab. This may have contributed to the higher efficacy with teriflunomide in this trial than previously reported. Nevertheless, ublituximab was more effective than teriflunomide at reducing the annualized relapse rates and MRI endpoints, but not for no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the ULTIMATE trials did show that ublituximab was superior to teriflunomide in NEDA. Long-term studies of the adverse effects of ublituximab are required. Despite the positive results from ULTIMATE for ublituximab, it is still under the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and conclusions should await their findings.",

During 2011-2020, 49 cases of HAT were diagnosed in 16 non-endemic countries across five continents: 35 cases were caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, mainly in tourists visiting wildlife areas in eastern and southern Africa, and 14 cases were due to T. b. gambiense, mainly in African migrants originating from or visiting endemic areas in western and central Africa. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: HAT diagnosis in non-endemic countries is rare and can be challenging, but alertness and surveillance must be maintained to contribute to WHO's elimination goals. Early detection is particularly important as it considerably improves the prognosis.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The introduction of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy with rituximab in the 1990s greatly improved outcomes for patients with B-cell malignancies. Disease resistance or relapse after successful initial therapy and declining efficacy of subsequent rounds of treatment were the basis for the development of alternative anti-CD20-based antibody therapies. AREAS COVERED: The novel anti-CD20 antibodies of atumumab, ublituximab, and obinutuzumab were developed to be differentiated via structural and mechanistic features over rituximab. We provide an overview of preclinical and clinical data, and demonstrate ways in which the pharmacodynamic properties of these novel agents translate into clinical benefit for patients. EXPERT OPINION: Of the novel anti-CD20 antibodies, only obinutuzumab has shown consistently improved efficacy over rituximab in randomized pivotal trials in indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The Phase 3 GALLIUM trial demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival with obinutuzumab-based immunochemotherapy over rituximab-based immunochemotherapy. Novel combinations of obinutuzumab, including with chemotherapy-free options are being explored, such as with the newly approved combinations of obinutuzumab with venetoclax, ibrutinib, or acalabrutinib. The biggest unmet need remains in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; emerging options in this field include the use of CAR-T cells and T-cell bispecific antibodies.",

Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies targeting CD19 have shown success for the treatment of pediatric patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody has demonstrated efficacy in neuroblastoma. In this review, we summarize the immunotherapeutic agents that have been approved for treating childhood cancers and provide an updated review of molecules expressed by pediatric cancers that are under study or are emerging candidates for future immunotherapies. Advances in our knowledge of tumor immunology and in genome profiling of cancers has led to the identification of new tumor-specific/associated antigens. While cell surface antigens are normally targeted in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent manner using antibody-based therapies, intracellular antigens are normally targeted with MHC-dependent T cell therapies. Glypican 2 (GPC2) and B7-H3 (CD276) are two cell surface antigens that are expressed by a variety of pediatric tumors such as neuroblastoma and potentially can have a positive impact on the treatment of pediatric cancers in the clinic.",

Targeting CD20 has proved to be efficacious in several B cell-mediated immunopathologies, as illustrated by the use of rituximab, the first anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Following rituximab, second- and third-generation anti-CD20 mAbs have been developed and tried in immune-mediated diseases, including obinutuzumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, and veltuzumab. However, their safety and efficacy has not been systematically reviewed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, and veltuzumab for the treatment of immune-mediated disorders compared to placebo, conventional treatment or other biologics. METHODS: The PRISMA checklist guided the reporting of the data. We searched the PubMed database between 4 October 2016 and 22 July 2021 concentrating on immune-mediated disorders. RESULTS: The literature search identified 2220 articles.

        "abstract": "Several years ago, dozens of cases were described in patients with symptoms very similar to mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). This new disease entity was described as mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome (MPSPS). The name of the disease indicates that in addition to the typical symptoms of conventional MPS, patients develop other features such as congenital heart defects and kidney and hematopoietic system disorders. The symptoms are highly advanced, and patients usually do not survive past the second year of life. MPSPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a homozygous-specific mutation in the gene encoding the VPS33A protein. To date, it has been described in 41 patients. Patients with MPSPS exhibited excessive excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the urine and exceptionally high levels of heparan sulfate in the plasma, but the accumulation of substrates is not caused by a decrease in the activity of any lysosomal enzymes. Here, we discuss the pathomechanisms and symptoms of MPSPS, comparing them to those of MPS. Moreover, we asked the question whether MPSPS should be classified as a type of MPS or a separate disease, as contrary to 'classical' MPS types, despite GAG accumulation, no defects in lysosomal enzymes responsible for degradation of these compounds could be detected in MPSPS. The molecular mechanism of the appearance of GAG accumulation in MPSPS is suggested on the basis of results available in the literature.",

Risk factors for obesity and cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, poor regulation of stress, low HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance are among the physical health repercussions we see. The psychological health effects comprise suicidal tendencies and symptoms of depression which are associated with digital device dependency, screen-time-induced poor sleep quality, and content-influenced negativity. Oftentimes it can cause the induction of a state of hyper-arousal, increase stress hormones, desynchronize the body clock or the circadian cycle, alter brain chemistry and create a drag on mental energy and development.

        "abstract": "Fatigue is defined as a symptom leading to the inability to continue functioning at the expected activity level. It is a highly prevalent symptom, challenging to frame into monodimensional pathophysiological mechanisms. As a result, fatigue is often underestimated in the clinical setting and is wrongly considered an unavoidable consequence of ageing. Several potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue have been proposed, including sleep patterns, autonomic nervous system abnormalities and biological complexity. Inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the most promising mechanisms through which malnutrition may cause fatigue. Not surprisingly, fatigue is highly prevalent in inflammatory conditions (e.g. COVID-19 infection). The nutritional status may also represent a critical factor in the development and presentation of fatigue, which may mimic the exhaustion of the individual's metabolic reserves. For example, the insufficient dietary intake of energy and proteins may determine the catabolism of body fat and muscles, disrupt the homeostatic balance and cause the onset of fatigue. It is necessary to conduct research on fatigue. By characterising its pathophysiological mechanisms, it will be possible to (1) support the design and development of targeted interventions, (2) improve the quality of life of many persons by acting on the symptom and (3) reduce the direct and indirect costs of a burdening condition typical of advancing age. In the present review, we provide an overview of the role that nutrition may play as a determinant of fatigue in older people, also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method.

        "abstract": "Vitamin K is traditionally connected with blood coagulation, since it is needed for the posttranslational modification of 7 proteins involved in this cascade. However, it is also involved in the maturation of another 11 or 12 proteins that play different roles, encompassing in particular the modulation of the calcification of connective tissues. Since this process is physiologically needed in bones, but is pathological in arteries, a great deal of research has been devoted to finding a possible link between vitamin K and the prevention of osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, the current knowledge does not allow us to make a decisive conclusion about such a link. One possible explanation for this is the diversity of the biological activity of vitamin K, which is not a single compound but a general term covering natural plant and animal forms of vitamin K (K1 and K2) as well as their synthetic congeners (K3 and K4). Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) is found in several vegetables. Menaquinones (MK4-MK13, a series of compounds known as vitamin K2) are mostly of a bacterial origin and are introduced into the human diet mainly through fermented cheeses. Current knowledge about the kinetics of different forms of vitamin K, their detection, and their toxicity are discussed in this review.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of childhood mortality. Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

Diet and nu-trition, coupled with proper physical activity have a significant impact on the health status of the elderly with a decreased risk of disease being indicative of successful aging. Musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia are the most frequently reported disorders among the elderly community. METHODS: This study presents a systematic review of the literature on the potential benefits of several nutra-ceuticals in promoting healthy aging and in reducing the risk of chronic diseases in elderly individuals. RESULTS: Dietary components including vitamins (vitamin C, B vitamin and vitamin K) flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, anthocyanins, and isoflavones), minerals (e.g., magnesium, zinc and potassium) and other nutrients such phytoestrogens, amino acids, and omega-3 fatty acids help in slowing the aging process, which ultimately results in increased lifespan and longevity. CONCLUSIONS: This paper highlights the key nutrients and phytochemicals of nutraceutical importance for the healthy aging of the elderly population.

        "abstract": "Analytic morphomics refers to the accurate measurement of specific biological markers of human body composition in diagnostic medical imaging. The increasing prevalence of disease processes that alter body composition including obesity, cachexia, and sarcopenia has generated interest in specific targeted measurement of these metrics to possibly prevent or reduce negative health outcomes. Typical morphomic measurements include the area and density of muscle, bone, vascular calcification, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat on a specific validated axial level in the patient's cross-sectional diagnostic imaging. A distinct advantage of these measurements is that they can be made retrospectively and opportunistically with pre-existing datasets. We provide a narrative review of the current state of art in morphomics, but also consider some potential future directions for this exciting field. Imaging based quantitative assessment of body composition has enormous potential across the breadth and scope of modern clinical practice. From risk stratification to treatment planning, and outcome assessment, all can be enhanced with the use of analytic morphomics. Moreover, it is likely that many new opportunities for personalized medicine will emerge as the field evolves. As radiologists, embracing analytic morphomics will enable us to contribute added value in the care of every patient.",

        "title": "Association of Interparental Violence and Maternal Depression With Depression Among Adolescents at the Population and Individual Level.",
        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Parental intimate partner violence (IPV) and maternal depression are associated with increased risk of depression in children at the population level. However, it is not known whether having information about these experiences can accurately identify individual children at higher risk of depression. OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which experiencing parental IPV and/or maternal depression before age 12 years is associated with depression at age 18 years at the population and individual level. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a UK population-based birth cohort, which initially recruited pregnant mothers with estimated due dates in 1991 and 1992. Data used in this study were collected from 1991 to 2009. Data analysis was performed from February to March 2022. EXPOSURES: Mother-reported parental IPV was assessed on 8 occasions (child age, 1-11 years). Maternal depression was assessed via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale or by the mother taking medication for depression, as reported by the mother on 8 occasions (child age, 2-12 years). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Depressive symptoms were measured with the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) and Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) when the child was aged 18 years. Binary indicators of a case of depression were derived the cutoff point of 11 points or above for the SMFQ and 12 points or above for the CIS-R. RESULTS: The study included 5029 children (2862 girls [56.9%]; 2167 boys [43.1%]) with a measure of depressive symptoms at age 18 years. IPV only was associated with a 24% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.97-1.59) higher risk of depression at age 18 years, exposure to maternal depression only was associated with a 35% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.11-1.64) higher risk, and exposure to both IPV and maternal depression was associated with a 68% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.34-2.10) higher risk. At the individual level, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.55-0.60) for depression according to the SMFQ and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.55-0.62) for the CIS-R, indicating a 58% to 59% probability (ie, 8%-9% above chance) that a random participant with depression at age 18 years had been exposed to IPV and/or maternal depression compared with a random participant who did not have depression. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, parental IPV and maternal depression were associated with depression in adolescence at the population level. However, estimation of an individual developing depression in adolescence based only on information about IPV or maternal depression is poor. Screening children for maternal depression and IPV to target interventions to prevent adolescent depression will fail to identify many children who might benefit and may unnecessarily target many others who do not develop depression.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method. The model has better diagnostic performance compared with conventional inflammatory indicators such as CRP, Hb, NEU%, and PCT.",

METHOD: Patients were recruited from the department of surgery in a large medical center in Taiwan. In this longitudinal pilot study, the Fatigue Symptom Inventory and fasting blood samples were collected at three assessments (i.e., prior to surgery (T0), three months (T1) and six months (T2) after surgery). Metabolomic profile analysis was used. Multilevel regression and pathway analyses were performed to identify differences in metabolomic profiles between the fatigued and non-fatigued groups. RESULTS: Of the 49 patients, 55.1% (n\u00a0=\u00a027) were in the fatigue group. All of the 15 metabolites that had statistically significant group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interactions in the differential metabolite analysis were entered into the pathway analysis. Two pathways were enriched for these metabolites, namely galactose metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this pilot study suggest that pathways involved in galactose metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis are associated with cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with CRC during CTX. These findings are consistent with the hypotheses that alterations in energy metabolism and increases in inflammation are associated with the development and maintenance of CRF.",

        "abstract": "The potential health effects of exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) remain largely unexplored. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence is a prevalent public health issue associated with all-cause maternal mortality. This study investigated the relationship between intimate partner violence, severe acute maternal morbidity in the intensive care unit (ICU), and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study in a hospital in Lima, Peru, with 109 cases (maternal ICU admissions) and 109 controls (obstetric patients not admitted to the ICU). Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and medical record review. Partner violence was assessed using the World Health Organization instrument. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the association between intimate partner violence and severe acute maternal morbidity. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher rate of intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy among cases (58.7%) than controls (27.5%). In multivariate analysis, intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy (aOR 3.83 (95% CI: 1.99-7.37)), being married (3.86 (1.27-11.73)), having <8 antenatal care visits (2.78 (1.14-6.80)), and having previous abortions (miscarriage, therapeutic, or unsafe) (1.69 (1.13-2.51)) were significantly associated with severe acute maternal morbidity. The ICU admission rate was 18.8 (per 1000 live births), and ICU maternal mortality was 1.7%. The perinatal mortality rate was higher in cases (9.3%) than in controls (1.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Intimate partner violence was associated with an increased risk of severe acute maternal morbidity. This suggests a more severe impact of intimate partner violence on pregnancy than has been previously identified.

This results in reversible suppression of spermatogenesis and marked decrease in sperm output in the ejaculate and preventing pregnancy in the female partner. PRIOR STUDIES: Studies of testosterone administered alone or in combination of another gonadotropin suppressive agent such as a progestin or gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog showed decisively that the exogenous hormone administrations are effective in suppressing sperm output with few adverse events that are not anticipated. In contraceptive efficacy studies, testosterone alone or combined with a progestin are as effective in preventing pregnancies as female contraceptive methods. CONCLUSION: Hormone combinations for male contraception are in late-phase clinical trials and hold the promise of being the new, reversible contraception method for men in over half a century. Lessons learned from the male hormonal contraceptive development pave the way for new targeted approached to regulate male fertility.",

        "abstract": "Current research on personality disorders strives to identify key behavioural and cognitive facets of patient functioning, to unravel the underlying root causes and maintenance mechanisms. This process often involves the application of social paradigms - however, these often only include momentary affective depictions rather than unfolding interactions. This constitutes a limitation in our capacity to probe core symptoms, and leaves potential findings uncovered which could help those who are in close relationships with affected individuals. Here, we deployed a novel task in which subjects interact with four unknown virtual partners in a turn-taking paradigm akin to a dance, and report on their experience with each. The virtual partners embody four combinations of low/high expressivity of positive/negative mood. Higher scores on our symptomatic measures of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were all linked to a general negative appraisal of all the interpersonal experiences. Moreover, the negative appraisal of the partner who displayed a high negative/low positive mood was tied with attachment anxiety and BPD symptoms. The extent to which subjects felt responsible for causing partners' distress was most strongly linked to attachment anxiety. Finally, we provide a fully-fledged exploration of move-by-move action latencies and click distances from partners. This analysis underscored slower movement initiation from anxiously attached individuals throughout all virtual interactions. In summary, we describe a novel paradigm for second-person neuroscience, which allowed both the replication of established results and the capture of new behavioural signatures associated with attachment anxiety, and discuss its limitations.",

        "title": "Intimate partner violence and maternal health services utilization: evidence from 36 National Household Surveys.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High rates of maternal mortality and intimate partner violence (IPV) are both major worldwide health challenges. Evidence from single-country samples suggests that IPV may be an important risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services, but there is little large-scale evidence on this association. This paper evaluates whether IPV is a risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services in a large cross-country sample, and also compiles evidence on the relative effects of different forms of IPV. METHODS: We analyze the association between intimate partner violence\u00a0and utilization of maternal health care, using a dataset compiling all Demographic and Health Surveys that report data on intimate partner violence. Using data on 166,685 women observed in 36 countries between 2005 and 2016, we estimate logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between lifetime experience of IPV and utilization of antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery care, and postnatal care. We estimate both unadjusted models and models adjusted for geographic and sociodemographic characteristics that are generally correlated with utilization of maternal health care (including age, education, number of children, wealth status, marital status, and urbanity). RESULTS: Lifetime experience of any IPV is associated with decreased use of maternal health services in a broad sample of births observed in lower and middle-income countries: in particular, the utilization of four or more ANC visits, the number of ANC visits, and the utilization of facility care at birth. This association remains statistically significant even after adjusting for country of residence, subnational region of residence, and additional individual-level covariates; however, there is no statistically significant association between experience of any IPV and postnatal care. The only form of IPV significantly associated with care utilization is physical IPV. CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing physical intimate partner violence show lower levels of utilization of maternal health services in a large sample of developing and middle-income countries. Given that reduced utilization of maternal health services is correlated with maternal and neonatal health outcomes, this pattern suggests that IPV prevention may be an important component of interventions targeting enhanced maternal and neonatal health.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "title": "Vascular Reactivity Index and PELOD-2 as a mortality predictor in paediatric septic shock: a single-centre retrospective study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mortality rate for children with septic shock is stil quite high in low-income and middle-income countries (31.7%). One of the most widely used scoring systems to assess mortality in sepsis or septic shock is Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD-2). However, it requires various laboratory evaluations. A non-invasive, fast and easy method is needed to assess the mortality of children with septic shock at an early stage. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the ability of Vascular Reactivity Index (VRI) compared with PELOD-2 score as a predictor of mortality in children with septic shock based on vascular response to vasoactive agents. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from children aged 1\u2009month to 18 years with septic shock treated in the ER and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the tertiary hospital from 2017 to 2021. The serial haemodynamic data were analysed including Systemic Vascular Resistant Index (SVRI) and the cardiac index from ultrasound cardiac output monitoring device was recorded in the first and sixth hours after the diagnosis of septic shock. The VRI was determined by dividing SVRI/Vasoactive Inotropic Score (ie, accumulated doses of dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, milrinone, vasopressin and norepinephrine). The receiver operating curve was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off point. RESULTS: A total of 68 subjects fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the median age was 54 months with a range of 2-204 months and the mortality rate was 47%. The majority of the patients who died were found in the high cardiac index and low SVRI group (17.6%). Moreover, the optimum cut-off point of VRI was obtained to predict mortality in septic shock of 32.1, with 87.5% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. The AUC for predicting death using VRI was 95% (95% CI 90% to 100%, p<0.001) and PELOD-2 92.6% (95% CI 96.4% to 98.8%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The VRI <32.1\u2009may potentially be used to predict mortality in children with septic shock and its predictive ability is as good as PELOD-2. The assessment of VRI is faster and easier than PELOD-2.",

        "title": "Family Talk versus usual services in improving child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness (PRIMERA-Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parental mental illness is common and can lead to dependent children incurring a high risk of developing mental disorders, physical illness, and impaired educational and occupational outcomes. Family Talk is one of the better known interventions designed to prevent the intergenerational transmission of mental illness. However, its evidence base is small, with few robust independent randomised controlled trials, and no associated process or cost evaluations. The PRIMERA (Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children) research programme involves a mixed method evaluation of Family Talk which is being delivered in mental health settings in Ireland to improve child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness. METHODS: The study comprises a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT), with nested economic and process evaluations, to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness and implementation mechanisms of Family Talk compared to usual services. The study is being conducted in 15 adult and child mental health settings in Ireland. Families with a parent with mental illness, and children aged 5-18\u2009years (n\u2009=\u2009144 families) will be randomised to either the 7-session Family Talk programme (n\u2009=\u200996) or to standard care (n\u2009=\u200948) using a 2:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcomes are child psychosocial functioning and family functioning. Secondary outcomes are as follows: understanding and experience of parental mental illness, parental mental health, child and parental resilience, partner wellbeing and service utilisation. Blind assessments will take place at pre-intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Given the prevalence and burden of intergenerational mental illness, it is imperative that prevention through evidence-based interventions becomes a public health priority. The current study will provide an important contribution to the international evidence base for Family Talk whilst also helping to identify key implementation lessons in the scaling up of Family Talk, and other similar interventions, within routine mental health settings.

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cannabis use has been the most commonly used illicit psychoactive substance in India. Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.",

At the same time, there has been an increase in the concentration of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol contained in cannabis. The aims of our study are to measure addictive and psychiatric comorbidities in cannabis users in France, and to compare characteristics between women and men. METHODS: Three hundred and forty-two\u00a0heavy cannabis users seen in a cannabis clinic between 2004 and 2014 were assessed during a 2-h clinical interview (DSM-IV, MINI). RESULTS: 83.2% of users are currently cannabis dependent, 10.6% alcohol dependent, and 2.1% cocaine/crack dependent. 37.8% have a current mood disorder, 47.6% have a current anxiety disorder, and 8.8% are psychotic. Women suffer significantly more often than men from major depressive episodes, dysthymia, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), both current and lifetime. Logistic regression shows that women have a significantly higher risk than men of suffering from PTSD over their lifetime (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20095.48; p\u2009<\u200910 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: French women heavy cannabis users are particularly at risk of PTSD\u00a0and are more likely than men to be dependent despite consuming fewer.

The United States (US) currently has the highest annual prevalence rate of cannabis consumption in the world, 17.9% in individuals aged 12 or older, and it is on the rise. With increasing cannabis use comes the potential for an increase in abuse, and according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), approximately 5.1% of Americans had Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) in 2020. Research has shown that genetics and epigenetics play a significant role in cannabis use and CUD. In fact, approximately 50-70% of liability to CUD and 40-48% of cannabis use initiation have been found to be the result of genetic factors. Cannabis usage and CUD have also been linked to an increased risk of psychiatric disorders and Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) subsets like schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. Comprehension of the genetic and epigenetic aspects of cannabinoids is necessary for future research, treatment plans, and the production of pure cannabinoid compounds, which will be essential for FDA approval. In conclusion, having a better understanding of the epigenetic and genetic underpinnings of cannabis use, CUD, and the endocannabinoid system as a whole will aid in the development of effective FDA-approved treatment therapies and the advancement of personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "Cannabis use and somatic consequences. Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit psychoactive substance in the world. It is perceived as a low-risk drug, as it is a plant, although many warnings in the medical literature underlined increased complications of cannabis use. Acute and chronic cannabis use is known to be harmful inducing psychiatric and addictive effects. An increase in the potency of cannabis as defined by a high ratio between the more important components, tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol has been observed for years, which leads to more serious complications. Evidence indicates that both acute and chronic consumptions of cannabis can be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Effects of cannabis use include mood disorders, exacerbation of psychotic disorders in vulnerable people, cannabis use disorders, withdrawal syndrome, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular and respiratory and other diseases. Synthetic cannabinoid has rapidly spread for the last few years; they are chemical substances inducing similar psychoactive effects to cannabis. Although, cannabis users call these substances \"cannabis\", synthetic cannabinoids have different pharmacological properties, which make them dangerous substances leading to more serious complications. Physicians dealing with cannabis users should be aware of these differences between vegetal cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids. Complications somatiques du cannabis.

Medical students were recruited from 35 French universities of medicine through administration mailing lists and social networks, between December 2016 and May 2017. Cannabis consumption was self-declared by anonymous questionnaire and CUD was defined by a Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) score\u2009\u2265\u20093. 10,985 medical students with a mean age of 21.8\u00a0years (\u00b1\u20093.3) were included, 32% of which were men. Overall, 1642 [14.9 (14.3; 15.6)%] reported cannabis consumption and 622 [5.7 (5.2; 6.1)%] students were identified with CUD at screening. Men were at two-time higher risk of cannabis consumption and three-time higher risk of CUD (22.4% and 10.6% for men vs. 11.5% and 3.4%, respectively, for women). In multivariate analyses, men sex, alcohol use disorder, tobacco smoking, parents' divorce, and history of physical assault and lower rates of lower rates of\u2009\u2265\u200940 weekly worked hours were identified as common associated factors for cannabis consumption and CUD. Hypnotic consumption, psychiatric follow-up, and history of sexual assault were identified as factors associated specifically with CUD, suggesting that these factors were associated with more severe cannabis consumption. Only 17% of students identified with CUD reported a psychiatric follow-up. Altogether, these results suggest that health policies should target cannabis consumption in medical students that is frequent, especially in men, with low rates of psychiatric follow-up. We have identified psychological factors and increased hypnotic drug consumption in CUD participants suggesting that psychiatric follow-up should be systematically proposed to this group.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess Gram-positive bacterial (GPB) bloodstream infection (BSI) in neonates, covering incidence, morbidity, mortality, antimicrobial resistance patterns and biomarkers in Region Stockholm, Sweden between 2006 and 2016. METHODS: A population-based retrospective epidemiological study including infants with GPB-BSI, admitted to the neonatal units at Karolinska University Hospital (KUH). Data were collected from patient records, the Swedish Neonatal Quality Register, the microbiological laboratory at KUH and the Swedish Public Health Agency. RESULTS: We identified 357 infants with GPB-BSI, representing an incidence of 1.47/1000 live births (LB). Group B streptococcus (GBS) was the most common pathogen causing BSI in full-term infants and early-onset sepsis (EOS) (0.20/1000 LB), while coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were predominant in infants born very preterm and in late-onset sepsis (LOS) (0.79/1000 LB). There were no fatal GBS BSI cases, but 10.2% developed meningitis. The GPB case fatality rate was 9.5% and the sepsis fatality rate 2.8%. In GPB-BSI, 1/10 did not have an elevated C-reactive protein level. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) BSI increased during the study period, but no methicillin or vancomycin resistant strains were found. The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rate was highest in CoNS isolates. CONCLUSION: GPB-BSI was four times more common than Gram-negative BSI in neonates but resulted in lower mortality rate. GBS was the most common pathogen in full-term infants and in EOS. CoNS was the most common pathogen in LOS and infants born very preterm, and the AMR rate was high in these isolates. The increasing trend of S. aureus BSI indicates a need of further investigation.",

        "abstract": "Cannabis remains the most commonly used and trafficked illicit drug in the world. Its use is largely concentrated among young people (15- to 34-year-olds). There is a variety of cannabis use patterns, ranging from experimental use to dependent use. Men are more likely than women to report both early initiation and frequent use of cannabis. Due to the high prevalence of cannabis use, the impact of cannabis on public health may be significant. A range of acute and chronic health problems associated with cannabis use has been identified. Cannabis can frequently have negative effects in its users, which may be amplified by certain demographic and/or psychosocial factors. Acute adverse effects include hyperemesis syndrome, impaired coordination and performance, anxiety, suicidal ideations/tendencies, and psychotic symptoms. Acute cannabis consumption is also associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle crashes, especially fatal collisions. Evidence indicates that frequent and prolonged use of cannabis can be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Chronic effects of cannabis use include mood disorders, exacerbation of psychotic disorders in vulnerable people, cannabis use disorders, withdrawal syndrome, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular and respiratory and other diseases.",

        "title": "Modifying effects of prenatal exposure to rare earth elements on birth outcomes through maternal thyroid function in early pregnancy.",
        "abstract": "The potential health effects of exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) remain largely unexplored. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

        "title": "Digitally augmented, parent-led CBT versus treatment as usual for child anxiety problems in child mental health services in England and Northern Ireland: a pragmatic, non-inferiority, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety problems are common in children, yet few affected children access evidence-based treatment. Digitally augmented psychological therapies bring potential to increase availability of effective help for children with mental health problems. This study aimed to establish whether therapist-supported, digitally augmented, parent-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could increase the efficiency of treatment without compromising clinical effectiveness and acceptability. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, unblinded, two-arm, multisite, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapist-supported, parent-led CBT using the Online Support and Intervention (OSI) for child anxiety platform compared with treatment as usual for child (aged 5-12 years) anxiety problems in 34 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in England and Northern Ireland. We examined acceptability of OSI plus therapist support via qualitative interviews. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OSI plus therapist support or treatment as usual, minimised by child age, gender, service type, and baseline child anxiety interference. Outcomes were assessed at week 14 and week 26 after randomisation. The primary clinical outcome was parent-reported interference caused by child anxiety at week 26 assessment, using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale-parent report (CAIS-P). The primary measure of health economic effect was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Outcome analyses were conducted blind in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with a standardised non-inferiority margin of 0\u00b733 for clinical analyses. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, 12890382. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2020, and Aug 3, 2022, 706 families (706 children and their parents or carers) were referred to the study information. 444 families were enrolled. Parents reported 255 (58%) child participants' gender to be female, 184 (41%) male, three (<1%) other, and one (<1%) preferred not to report their child's gender. 400 (90%) children were White and the mean age was 9\u00b720 years (SD 1\u00b779). 85% of families for whom clinicians provided information in the treatment as usual group received CBT. OSI plus therapist support was non-inferior for parent-reported anxiety interference on the CAIS-P (SMD 0\u00b701, 95% CI -0\u00b715 to 0\u00b717; p<0\u00b70001) and all secondary outcomes. The mean difference in QALYs across trial arms approximated to zero, and OSI plus therapist support was associated with lower costs than treatment as usual. OSI plus therapist support was likely to be cost effective under certain scenarios, but uncertainty was high. OSI plus therapist support acceptability was good. No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Digitally augmented intervention brought promising savings without compromising outcomes and as such presents a valuable tool for increasing access to psychological therapies and meeting the demand for treatment of child anxiety problems.

        "abstract": "The present study examined genetic, prenatal, and postnatal environmental pathways in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and depressive symptoms from parents to early adolescents (when these symptoms start to increase), while considering timing effects of exposure to parent anxiety and depressive symptoms postnatally. The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

        "abstract": "Dependency on digital devices resulting in an ever-increasing daily screen time has subsequently also been the cause of several adverse effects on physical and mental or psychological health. Constant exposure to devices like smartphones, personal computers, and television can severely affect mental health- increase stress and anxiety, for example, and cause various sleep issues in both children as well as adults. Risk factors for obesity and cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, poor regulation of stress, low HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance are among the physical health repercussions we see. The psychological health effects comprise suicidal tendencies and symptoms of depression which are associated with digital device dependency, screen-time-induced poor sleep quality, and content-influenced negativity. Oftentimes it can cause the induction of a state of hyper-arousal, increase stress hormones, desynchronize the body clock or the circadian cycle, alter brain chemistry and create a drag on mental energy and development.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence is a prevalent public health issue associated with all-cause maternal mortality. This study investigated the relationship between intimate partner violence, severe acute maternal morbidity in the intensive care unit (ICU), and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study in a hospital in Lima, Peru, with 109 cases (maternal ICU admissions) and 109 controls (obstetric patients not admitted to the ICU). Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and medical record review. Partner violence was assessed using the World Health Organization instrument. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the association between intimate partner violence and severe acute maternal morbidity. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher rate of intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy among cases (58.7%) than controls (27.5%). In multivariate analysis, intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy (aOR 3.83 (95% CI: 1.99-7.37)), being married (3.86 (1.27-11.73)), having <8 antenatal care visits (2.78 (1.14-6.80)), and having previous abortions (miscarriage, therapeutic, or unsafe) (1.69 (1.13-2.51)) were significantly associated with severe acute maternal morbidity. The ICU admission rate was 18.8 (per 1000 live births), and ICU maternal mortality was 1.7%. The perinatal mortality rate was higher in cases (9.3%) than in controls (1.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Intimate partner violence was associated with an increased risk of severe acute maternal morbidity. This suggests a more severe impact of intimate partner violence on pregnancy than has been previously identified. Inquiring about intimate partner violence during prenatal visits may prevent further harm to the mother-baby dyad.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of several prognostic scores calculated in the first 24 hours of admission (day 1) in predicting mortality and morbidity among critically ill children with sepsis presenting to the pediatric emergency department (PED) and then admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). METHODS: Single-center, retrospective cohort study in children with a diagnosis of sepsis visiting the PED and then admitted to the PICU from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019. Sepsis organ dysfunction scores-pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) (Schlapbach, Matics, Shime), quickSOFA, quickSOFA-L, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD)-2, quickPELOD-2, and Pediatric Multiple Organ Dysfunction score-were calculated during the first 24 hours of admission (day 1) and their performance compared with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and severe sepsis-International Consensus Conference on Pediatric Sepsis(ICCPS)-derived criteria-using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Primary outcome was PICU mortality. Secondary outcomes were: a composite of death and new disability (ie, change from baseline Pediatric Overall Performance Category score \u22651); prolonged PICU length of stay (>5 d); prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) (>3 d). RESULTS: Among 60 patients with sepsis, 4 (6.7%) died, 7 (11.7%) developed new disability, 26 (43.3%) experienced prolonged length of stay, and 21 (35%) prolonged invasive MV. The prognostic ability in mortality discrimination was significantly higher for organ dysfunction scores, with PELOD-2 showing the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.924; 95% confidence interval, 0.837-1.000), significantly better than SIRS 3 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P = 0.009), SIRS 4 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P < 0.001), and severe sepsis (0.924 vs 0.527, P < 0.001). Among secondary outcomes, PELOD-2 performed significantly better than SIRS criteria and severe sepsis to predict prolonged duration of invasive MV, whereas better than severe sepsis to predict \"poor outcome\" (mortality or new disability). CONCLUSIONS: Day 1 organ dysfunction scores performed better in predicting mortality and morbidity outcomes than ICCPS-derived criteria. The PELOD-2 was the organ dysfunction score with the best performance for all outcomes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preterm infants are a special population that vulnerable to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and the lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) caused by RSV could be severe and even life-threating. The purpose of the present study was to identify candidate genes of preterm infants who are susceptible to RSV infection and provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of RSV infection. METHODS: Three datasets (GSE77087, GSE69606 and GSE41374) containing 183 blood samples of RSV infected patients and 33 blood samples of healthy controls from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were downloaded and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out. The function and pathway enrichments were analyzed through Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for DEGs was constructed through Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). The module analysis was performed by Cytoscape software and hub genes were identified. Clinical verification was employed to verify the expression level of top five hub genes among 72 infants including 50 RSV infected patients and 22 non-RSV-infected patients hospitalized in our center. Further, the RSV infected infants with high-expression IFI27 and those with low-expression IFI27 were compared (defined as higher or lower than the median mRNA level). Finally, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) focusing on IFI27 was carried out. RESULTS: Totally, 4028 DEGs were screened out and among which, 131 most significant DEGs were selected. Subsequently, 13 hub genes were identified, and function and pathway enrichments of hub genes mainly were: response to virus, defense response to virus, regulation of viral genome replication and regulation of viral life cycle. Furthermore, IFI27 was confirmed to be the most significantly expressed in clinical verification. Gene sets associated with calcium signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix receptor interaction and so on were significantly enriched when IFI27 was highly expressed. Moreover, high-expression IFI27 was associated with more severe cases (p\u2009=\u20090.041), more requirements of mechanical ventilation (p\u2009=\u20090.034), more frequent hospitalization (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and longer cumulative hospital stay (p\u2009=\u20090.012). CONCLUSION: IFI27 might serve to predict RSV infection and evaluate the severity of RSV infection in preterm infants.",

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms \"sepsis,\" \"septicemia,\" or \"septic shock\" in the title or abstract. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Strong associations of several markers of organ dysfunction with the outcomes of interest among infected and septic children support their inclusion in the data validation phase of the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce.",

        "abstract": "Analytic morphomics refers to the accurate measurement of specific biological markers of human body composition in diagnostic medical imaging. The increasing prevalence of disease processes that alter body composition including obesity, cachexia, and sarcopenia has generated interest in specific targeted measurement of these metrics to possibly prevent or reduce negative health outcomes. Typical morphomic measurements include the area and density of muscle, bone, vascular calcification, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat on a specific validated axial level in the patient's cross-sectional diagnostic imaging. A distinct advantage of these measurements is that they can be made retrospectively and opportunistically with pre-existing datasets. We provide a narrative review of the current state of art in morphomics, but also consider some potential future directions for this exciting field. Imaging based quantitative assessment of body composition has enormous potential across the breadth and scope of modern clinical practice. From risk stratification to treatment planning, and outcome assessment, all can be enhanced with the use of analytic morphomics. Moreover, it is likely that many new opportunities for personalized medicine will emerge as the field evolves. As radiologists, embracing analytic morphomics will enable us to contribute added value in the care of every patient.",

The aim of this article is to<br />describe the protocol and results for altruistic embryo donation of the only embryo bank in the Netherlands.<br />Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive study. Since 2011, donated cryo-embryos from couples that have undergone<br />in vitro-fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) treatments, are being stored in our embryo<br />bank. The majority of the donated embryos were frozen on day 3 or 4 by slow freezing techniques. We perform a<br />thorough medical and psychological screening of donor couples and recipients, according to the protocol drawn up in<br />close collaboration with the Dutch Ministry of Health.<br />Results: Up to June 2021, 54 women have received embryos from our embryo bank, all single embryo transfers.<br />While the clinical pregnancy rate in 'unknown' embryo donations was relatively high (25.3%), the live birth rate<br />shows limited success (12.6%), partly due to high pregnancy loss through miscarriage. In known donation procedures,<br />the recipients tend to undergo more procedures, depending on the number of donated cryo-embryos.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method. The model has better diagnostic performance compared with conventional inflammatory indicators such as CRP, Hb, NEU%, and PCT.",

STUDY DESIGN: After a Phase I double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating trial of oral DMAU for 28-days, 57 healthy male volunteers completed a survey assessing their experience and satisfaction with the regimen. In the trial, participants were randomized to receive up to 4 DMAU capsules daily versus placebo and instructed to ingest them within 30\u00a0min of consuming a high fat meal. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were performed, followed by a 6-week recovery phase. Participants were counseled that they could not rely on the drug for contraception. RESULTS: Fifty-seven participants were offered acceptability surveys (39 DMAU, 18 placebo). Most respondents, 80% (45/56), reported satisfaction with the method; 77% (44/57) would recommend it. 54% (31/57), reported that, if available, they would use the method as their primary contraceptive. More respondents reported satisfaction with active DMAU than placebo (87% vs. 67%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Most respondents, 91% (52/57), reported no difficulty with having to take up to 4 pills within 30\u00a0min of ingesting a high-fat meal. CONCLUSION: Most participants reported that the study method, daily oral DMAU or placebo, was satisfactory and acceptable. Having to take the drug after a high-fat meal did not detract from acceptability. IMPLICATIONS: Most participants in a 4-week trial of daily DMAU capsules would recommend and use the method. High satisfaction among DMAU and placebo groups affirms acceptability of a daily male contraceptive pill, warranting further study of oral DMAU.",

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC), Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2), pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA), and Pediatric Organ Dysfunction Information Update Mandate (PODIUM) scores, measured at blood culture sampling, to predict 30-day mortality. We analyzed 877 sepsis episodes in 807 children, with a 30-day mortality of 4.3%. Percentage with organ dysfunction ranged from 32.7% (IPSCC) to 55.3% (pSOFA). In adjusted analyses, the accuracy for identification of 30-day mortality was area under the curve (AUC) 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82-0.92) for IPSCC, 0.83 (0.76-0.89) for PELOD-2, 0.85 (0.78-0.92) for pSOFA, and 0.85 (0.78-0.91) for PODIUM. When restricting scores to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction, the adjusted AUC was 0.89 (0.84-0.94) for IPSCC, 0.85 (0.79-0.91) for PELOD-2, 0.87 (0.81-0.93) for pSOFA, and 0.88 (0.83-0.93) for PODIUM. CONCLUSIONS: IPSCC, PELOD-2, pSOFA, and PODIUM performed similarly to predict 30-day mortality. Simplified scores restricted to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction yielded comparable performance.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mortality rate for children with septic shock is stil quite high in low-income and middle-income countries (31.7%). One of the most widely used scoring systems to assess mortality in sepsis or septic shock is Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD-2). However, it requires various laboratory evaluations. A non-invasive, fast and easy method is needed to assess the mortality of children with septic shock at an early stage. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the ability of Vascular Reactivity Index (VRI) compared with PELOD-2 score as a predictor of mortality in children with septic shock based on vascular response to vasoactive agents. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from children aged 1\u2009month to 18 years with septic shock treated in the ER and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the tertiary hospital from 2017 to 2021. The serial haemodynamic data were analysed including Systemic Vascular Resistant Index (SVRI) and the cardiac index from ultrasound cardiac output monitoring device was recorded in the first and sixth hours after the diagnosis of septic shock. The VRI was determined by dividing SVRI/Vasoactive Inotropic Score (ie, accumulated doses of dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, milrinone, vasopressin and norepinephrine). The receiver operating curve was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off point. RESULTS: A total of 68 subjects fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the median age was 54 months with a range of 2-204 months and the mortality rate was 47%. The majority of the patients who died were found in the high cardiac index and low SVRI group (17.6%). Moreover, the optimum cut-off point of VRI was obtained to predict mortality in septic shock of 32.1, with 87.5% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. The AUC for predicting death using VRI was 95% (95% CI 90% to 100%, p<0.001) and PELOD-2 92.6% (95% CI 96.4% to 98.8%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The VRI <32.1\u2009may potentially be used to predict mortality in children with septic shock and its predictive ability is as good as PELOD-2. The assessment of VRI is faster and easier than PELOD-2.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis remains one of the leading causes of mortality in newborns. Several brainstem-regulated physiological processes undergo disruption during neonatal sepsis. Mechanistic knowledge gaps exist at the interplay between metabolism and immune activation to brainstem neural circuits and pertinent physiological functions in neonates. To delineate this association, we induced systemic inflammation either by TLR4 (LPS) or TLR1/2 (PAM3CSK4) ligand administration in postnatal day 5 mice (PD5). Our findings show that LPS and PAM3CSK4 evoke substantial changes in respiration and metabolism. Physiological trade-offs led to hypometabolic-hypothermic responses due to LPS, but not PAM3CSK4, whereas to both TLR ligands blunted respiratory chemoreflexes. Neuroinflammatory pathways modulation in brainstem showed more robust effects in LPS than PAM3CSK4. Brainstem neurons, microglia, and astrocyte gene expression analyses showed unique responses to TLR ligands. PAM3CSK4 did not significantly modulate gene expression changes in GLAST-1 positive brainstem astrocytes. PD5 pups receiving PAM3CSK4 failed to maintain a prolonged metabolic state repression, which correlated to enhanced gasping latency and impaired autoresuscitation during anoxic chemoreflex challenges. In contrast, LPS administered pups showed no significant changes in anoxic chemoreflex. Electrophysiological studies from brainstem slices prepared from pups exposed to either TLR4 or PAM3CSK4 showed compromised transmission between preB\u00f6tzinger complex and Hypoglossal as an exclusive response to the TLR1/2 ligand. Spatial gene expression analysis demonstrated a region-specific modulation of PAM3CSK4 within the raphe nucleus relative to other anatomical sites evaluated. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes due to inflammation might be a crucial tolerance mechanism for neonatal sepsis preserving neural control of breathing.",

Although the current understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis has improved, the differences between viral and bacterial sepsis at the level of pathophysiology are not well understood. Diagnosis methods that can broadly differentiate between bacterial and viral sepsis at the initial stage after the development of sepsis are limited.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms \"sepsis,\" \"septicemia,\" or \"septic shock\" in the title or abstract. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001).

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can be caused by a broad range of pathogens; however, bacterial infections represent the majority of sepsis cases. Up to 42% of sepsis presentations are culture negative, suggesting a non-bacterial cause. Despite this, diagnosis of viral sepsis remains very rare. Almost any virus can cause sepsis in vulnerable patients (e.g., neonates, infants, and other immunosuppressed groups). The prevalence of viral sepsis is not known, nor is there enough information to make an accurate estimate. The initial standard of care for all cases of sepsis, even those that are subsequently proven to be culture negative, is the immediate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the absence of definite diagnostic criteria for viral sepsis, or at least to exclude bacterial sepsis, this inevitably leads to unnecessary antimicrobial use, with associated consequences for antimicrobial resistance, effects on the host microbiome and excess healthcare costs. It is important to understand non-bacterial causes of sepsis so that inappropriate treatment can be minimised, and appropriate treatments can be developed to improve outcomes. In this review, we summarise what is known about viral sepsis, its most common causes, and how the immune responses to severe viral infections can contribute to sepsis. We also discuss strategies to improve our understanding of viral sepsis, and ways we can integrate this new information into effective treatment.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pediatric sepsis is a complicated condition characterized by life-threatening organ failure resulting from a dysregulated host response to infection in children. It is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, and rapid detection and administration of antimicrobials have been emphasized. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic biomarkers of pediatric sepsis and the function of immune cell infiltration in the development of this illness. METHODS: Three gene expression datasets were available from the Gene Expression Omnibus collection. First, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found with the use of the R program, and then gene set enrichment analysis was carried out. Subsequently, the DEGs were combined with the major module genes chosen using the weighted gene co-expression network. The hub genes were identified by the use of three machine-learning algorithms: random forest, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The receiver operating characteristic curve and nomogram model were used to verify the discrimination and efficacy of the hub genes. In addition, the inflammatory and immune status of pediatric sepsis was assessed using cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT). The relationship between the diagnostic markers and infiltrating immune cells was further studied. RESULTS: Overall, after overlapping key module genes and DEGs, we detected 402 overlapping genes. As pediatric sepsis diagnostic indicators, CYSTM1 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.988), MMP8 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.973), and CD177 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.986) were investigated and demonstrated statistically significant differences (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and diagnostic efficacy in the validation set. As indicated by the immune cell infiltration analysis, multiple immune cells may be involved in the development of pediatric sepsis. Additionally, all diagnostic characteristics may correlate with immune cells to varying degrees. CONCLUSIONS: The candidate hub genes (CD177, CYSTM1, and MMP8) were identified, and the nomogram was constructed for pediatric sepsis diagnosis. Our study could provide potential peripheral blood diagnostic candidate genes for pediatric sepsis patients.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The open-label phase 3 \"Treatment with IncobotulinumtoxinA in Movement Open-Label\" (TIMO) study investigated longer-term safety and efficacy of incobotulinumtoxin A in children/adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP). METHODS: Patients on standard treatment, with unilateral or bilateral lower limb (LL) or combined upper limb (UL)/LL spasticity received four incobotulinumtoxinA injection cycles (16 or 20 Units/kg bodyweight total [maximum 400 or 500 Units] per cycle depending on ambulatory status/clinical pattern treated), each followed by 12-16 weeks' observation. Treatment for pes equinus was mandatory; flexed knee or adducted thigh were options for unilateral treatment and/or ULs for unilateral/bilateral treatment. The primary endpoint was safety; changes in Ashworth Scale and Gross Motor Function Measure-66 scores, and Global Impression of Change Scale scores at week 4 of each injection cycle were also evaluated. RESULTS: IncobotulinumtoxinA (\u2264500 Units for \u226498 weeks) was safe, well-tolerated, and effective across all endpoints for multipattern treatment of LL and combined LL/UL spasticity in ambulant/nonambulant children/adolescents with CP. Treatment effects increased with each injection cycle. No new/unexpected safety concerns were identified. CONCLUSION: IncobotulinumtoxinA showed a good safety and tolerability profile, with efficacy over multiple clinical presentations. As an adjunct treatment, it offers an effective, individualized treatment option for pediatric CP-related spasticity.",

        "title": "Fatigue in older persons: the role of nutrition.",
        "abstract": "Fatigue is defined as a symptom leading to the inability to continue functioning at the expected activity level. It is a highly prevalent symptom, challenging to frame into monodimensional pathophysiological mechanisms. As a result, fatigue is often underestimated in the clinical setting and is wrongly considered an unavoidable consequence of ageing. Several potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue have been proposed, including sleep patterns, autonomic nervous system abnormalities and biological complexity. Inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the most promising mechanisms through which malnutrition may cause fatigue. Not surprisingly, fatigue is highly prevalent in inflammatory conditions (e.g. COVID-19 infection). The nutritional status may also represent a critical factor in the development and presentation of fatigue, which may mimic the exhaustion of the individual's metabolic reserves. For example, the insufficient dietary intake of energy and proteins may determine the catabolism of body fat and muscles, disrupt the homeostatic balance and cause the onset of fatigue. It is necessary to conduct research on fatigue. By characterising its pathophysiological mechanisms, it will be possible to (1) support the design and development of targeted interventions, (2) improve the quality of life of many persons by acting on the symptom and (3) reduce the direct and indirect costs of a burdening condition typical of advancing age. In the present review, we provide an overview of the role that nutrition may play as a determinant of fatigue in older people, also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Diet and nu-trition, coupled with proper physical activity have a significant impact on the health status of the elderly with a decreased risk of disease being indicative of successful aging. Musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia are the most frequently reported disorders among the elderly community. METHODS: This study presents a systematic review of the literature on the potential benefits of several nutra-ceuticals in promoting healthy aging and in reducing the risk of chronic diseases in elderly individuals. RESULTS: Dietary components including vitamins (vitamin C, B vitamin and vitamin K) flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, anthocyanins, and isoflavones), minerals (e.g., magnesium, zinc and potassium) and other nutrients such phytoestrogens, amino acids, and omega-3 fatty acids help in slowing the aging process, which ultimately results in increased lifespan and longevity. CONCLUSIONS: This paper highlights the key nutrients and phytochemicals of nutraceutical importance for the healthy aging of the elderly population.

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has become the standard of care for children and young adults with relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and it is a highly promising therapy under investigation for adults with relapsed disease. Despite having potentially life-threatening toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, the benefits of CAR T-cell therapy far outweigh these risks, particularly as increased experience and improved supportive care measures are mitigating these toxicities. CAR T cells can result in complete remission for significant proportion of patients with relapsed and refractory B-ALL and permit them to proceed to potentially curative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). CAR T cells may also be curative by themselves. Herein lie the greatest challenges and questions for clinical investigators, specifically, how are CAR T cells best employed and how do we overcome mechanisms of resistance to them? The primary clinical question is the timing and even the necessity of allo-HSCT. Relative to resistance, we know that target antigen loss, specifically CD19, is a major contributor to resistance. However, current investigations of alternative targets, such CD22, and CAR T cells expressing dual targeting antigen receptors have demonstrated encouraging initial results and provide a high degree of optimism that the efficacy and the broader application of CAR T-cell therapy will gradually increase in B-ALL. That optimism is not as high and the challenges are increased for the application of CAR T cells in T-cell leukemias and acute myeloid leukemia due to the relative lack of suitable leukemia surface targets that are not also expressed on normal hematopoietic progenitors. Despite these significant challenges, considerable research is being conducted into the development of CAR T cells for these diseases utilizing unique technologies, which may be applicable to other diseases.",

It is perceived as a low-risk drug, as it is a plant, although many warnings in the medical literature underlined increased complications of cannabis use. Acute and chronic cannabis use is known to be harmful inducing psychiatric and addictive effects. An increase in the potency of cannabis as defined by a high ratio between the more important components, tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol has been observed for years, which leads to more serious complications. Evidence indicates that both acute and chronic consumptions of cannabis can be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Effects of cannabis use include mood disorders, exacerbation of psychotic disorders in vulnerable people, cannabis use disorders, withdrawal syndrome, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular and respiratory and other diseases. Synthetic cannabinoid has rapidly spread for the last few years; they are chemical substances inducing similar psychoactive effects to cannabis. Although, cannabis users call these substances \"cannabis\", synthetic cannabinoids have different pharmacological properties, which make them dangerous substances leading to more serious complications. Physicians dealing with cannabis users should be aware of these differences between vegetal cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids. Complications somatiques du cannabis.

Disease resistance or relapse after successful initial therapy and declining efficacy of subsequent rounds of treatment were the basis for the development of alternative anti-CD20-based antibody therapies. AREAS COVERED: The novel anti-CD20 antibodies of atumumab, ublituximab, and obinutuzumab were developed to be differentiated via structural and mechanistic features over rituximab. We provide an overview of preclinical and clinical data, and demonstrate ways in which the pharmacodynamic properties of these novel agents translate into clinical benefit for patients. EXPERT OPINION: Of the novel anti-CD20 antibodies, only obinutuzumab has shown consistently improved efficacy over rituximab in randomized pivotal trials in indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The Phase 3 GALLIUM trial demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival with obinutuzumab-based immunochemotherapy over rituximab-based immunochemotherapy. Novel combinations of obinutuzumab, including with chemotherapy-free options are being explored, such as with the newly approved combinations of obinutuzumab with venetoclax, ibrutinib, or acalabrutinib. The biggest unmet need remains in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; emerging options in this field include the use of CAR-T cells and T-cell bispecific antibodies.",

        "title": "Intimate partner violence and maternal health services utilization: evidence from 36 National Household Surveys.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High rates of maternal mortality and intimate partner violence (IPV) are both major worldwide health challenges. Evidence from single-country samples suggests that IPV may be an important risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services, but there is little large-scale evidence on this association. This paper evaluates whether IPV is a risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services in a large cross-country sample, and also compiles evidence on the relative effects of different forms of IPV. METHODS: We analyze the association between intimate partner violence\u00a0and utilization of maternal health care, using a dataset compiling all Demographic and Health Surveys that report data on intimate partner violence. Using data on 166,685 women observed in 36 countries between 2005 and 2016, we estimate logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between lifetime experience of IPV and utilization of antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery care, and postnatal care. We estimate both unadjusted models and models adjusted for geographic and sociodemographic characteristics that are generally correlated with utilization of maternal health care (including age, education, number of children, wealth status, marital status, and urbanity). RESULTS: Lifetime experience of any IPV is associated with decreased use of maternal health services in a broad sample of births observed in lower and middle-income countries: in particular, the utilization of four or more ANC visits, the number of ANC visits, and the utilization of facility care at birth. This association remains statistically significant even after adjusting for country of residence, subnational region of residence, and additional individual-level covariates; however, there is no statistically significant association between experience of any IPV and postnatal care. The only form of IPV significantly associated with care utilization is physical IPV. CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing physical intimate partner violence show lower levels of utilization of maternal health services in a large sample of developing and middle-income countries. Given that reduced utilization of maternal health services is correlated with maternal and neonatal health outcomes, this pattern suggests that IPV prevention may be an important component of interventions targeting enhanced maternal and neonatal health.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We evaluated adapting the quick Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment score (fast respiratory rate, altered mental status, low blood pressure) for pediatric use by selecting thresholds from three commonly used definitions: Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2, Pediatric Advanced Life Support, and International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference. We examined their respective performance in identifying children who had a discharge diagnosis of infection at high risk of mortality using PICU registry data, with additional focus on the influence of age on performance. DESIGN: Analysis of retrospective data obtained from the Virtual Pediatric Systems PICU database. The performance in predicting observed mortality was assessed for the three candidate approaches using receiver operating characteristics analysis, including age group effects. SETTING: The Virtual Pediatric Systems database contains data on diagnosis, clinical markers, and outcomes in prospectively collected clinical records from 130 participating PICUs in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: Children who had a discharge diagnosis of infection in a participating PICU between 2009 and 2014, for which all required data were available. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data from 40,228 children revealed an overall mortality of 4.22%. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (95% CI) was 0.760 (0.749-0.771) for Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 with mechanical ventilation, 0.700 (0.689-0.712) for Pediatric Advanced Life Support, and 0.709 (0.696-0.721) for International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference. When split by age group, the performance of Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 with mechanical ventilation was lowest in the youngest neonates (under 1\u2009wk old), with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (95% CI) of 0.724 (0.656-0.791), and in the teenagers (13-18 yr), with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.710 (0.682-0.738), yet it still outperformed Pediatric Advanced Life Support and International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among critically ill children who had a discharge diagnosis of infection in the PICU, quick Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment score performs best when using the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 age thresholds with mechanical ventilation, while all definitions performed worse at extremes of pediatric age. Thus, mortality risk varies with vital sign thresholds, and although Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 with mechanical ventilation performed marginally better, it is unlikely to be of use to clinicians. More work is needed to develop a robust and relevant pediatric sepsis risk score.",

ORA is therefore a critical method in the interpretation of 'omics data, relating gene lists to biological functions and themes. Although ORA is hugely popular, we and others have noticed two potentially undesired behaviours of some ORA tools. The first one we call the 'background problem', because it involves the software eliminating large numbers of genes from the background list if they are not annotated as belonging to any category. The second one we call the 'false discovery rate problem', because some tools underestimate the true number of parallel tests conducted. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate the impact of these issues on several real RNA-seq datasets and use simulated RNA-seq data to quantify the impact of these problems. We show that the severity of these problems depends on the gene set library, the number of genes in the list, and the degree of noise in the dataset. These problems can be mitigated by changing packages/websites for ORA or by changing to another approach such as functional class scoring.

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population. Taken together, we concluded that the IL-17 signaling pathway serves as a significant potential mechanism of sepsis and provides a promising therapeutic target for sepsis treatment.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transmembrane (TMEM) protein genes are a class of proteins that spans membranes and function to many physiological processes. However, there is very little known about TMEM gene expression, especially in cancer tissue. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequence may facilitate the understanding of this poorly characterized protein genes in PDAC. METHODS: We selected the TMEM family genes through the Human Protein Atlas and characterized their expression by single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. Identification of the key TMEM genes was performed through three machine learning algorithms: LASSO, SVM-RFE and RF-SRC. Then, we established TMEM gene riskscore and estimate its implication in predicting survival and response to systematic therapy. Additionally, we explored the difference and impact of TMEM gene expression in PDAC through immunohistochemistry and cell line research. RESULTS: 5 key TMEM genes (ANO1, TMEM59, TMEM204, TMEM205, TMEM92) were selected based on the single-cell analysis and machine learning survival outcomes. Patients stratified into the high and low-risk groups based on TMEM riskscore, were observed with distinct overall survival in internal and external datasets. Moreover, through bulk RNA-sequence and immunohistochemical staining we verified the protein expression of TMEM genes in PDAC and revealed TMEM92 as an essential regulator of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSION: Our study on TMEM gene expression and behavior in PDAC has revealed unique characteristics, offering potential for precise therapeutic approaches. Insights into molecular mechanisms expand understanding of PDAC complexity and TMEM gene roles. Such knowledge may inform targeted therapy development, benefiting patients.",

Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method. The model has better diagnostic performance compared with conventional inflammatory indicators such as CRP, Hb, NEU%, and PCT.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The involvement of B-cells in multiple sclerosis has only recently emerged. Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the B-cell antigen CD20 with enhanced B-cell targeting. AREAS COVERED: This evaluation is of the identical ULTIMATE (UbLiTuximab In Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Effects) I and II trials comparing ublituximab (TG-1101) and teriflunomide in relapsing multiple sclerosis. The primary efficacy end point was the annualized relapse rate and was lower in the ublituximab than the teriflunomide group. EXPERT OPINION: The continuation rates to oral teriflunomide in ULTIMATE were higher than in other trials, possibly because of the supervised double-dummy protocol used with intravenous ublituximab. This may have contributed to the higher efficacy with teriflunomide in this trial than previously reported. Nevertheless, ublituximab was more effective than teriflunomide at reducing the annualized relapse rates and MRI endpoints, but not for no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the ULTIMATE trials did show that ublituximab was superior to teriflunomide in NEDA. Long-term studies of the adverse effects of ublituximab are required. Despite the positive results from ULTIMATE for ublituximab, it is still under the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and conclusions should await their findings.",

The purpose of the present study was to identify candidate genes of preterm infants who are susceptible to RSV infection and provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of RSV infection. METHODS: Three datasets (GSE77087, GSE69606 and GSE41374) containing 183 blood samples of RSV infected patients and 33 blood samples of healthy controls from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were downloaded and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out. The function and pathway enrichments were analyzed through Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for DEGs was constructed through Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). The module analysis was performed by Cytoscape software and hub genes were identified. Clinical verification was employed to verify the expression level of top five hub genes among 72 infants including 50 RSV infected patients and 22 non-RSV-infected patients hospitalized in our center. Further, the RSV infected infants with high-expression IFI27 and those with low-expression IFI27 were compared (defined as higher or lower than the median mRNA level). Finally, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) focusing on IFI27 was carried out. RESULTS: Totally, 4028 DEGs were screened out and among which, 131 most significant DEGs were selected. Subsequently, 13 hub genes were identified, and function and pathway enrichments of hub genes mainly were: response to virus, defense response to virus, regulation of viral genome replication and regulation of viral life cycle. Furthermore, IFI27 was confirmed to be the most significantly expressed in clinical verification. Gene sets associated with calcium signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix receptor interaction and so on were significantly enriched when IFI27 was highly expressed. Moreover, high-expression IFI27 was associated with more severe cases (p\u2009=\u20090.041), more requirements of mechanical ventilation (p\u2009=\u20090.034), more frequent hospitalization (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and longer cumulative hospital stay (p\u2009=\u20090.012). CONCLUSION: IFI27 might serve to predict RSV infection and evaluate the severity of RSV infection in preterm infants.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide expression profiles have been previously employed as clinical research diagnostic tools for newborn sepsis. We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

Research suggests gender affirmation surgery has been established as an effective and medically indicated treatment for gender dysphoria. Although most data on gender-affirming surgeries are from adult populations, there is growing literature establishing their effectiveness in adolescents and young adults. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the perioperative outcomes for gender-diverse youth to deliver safe and affirming care. The primary objective of this retrospective case series is to examine the perioperative characteristics and outcomes of patients with gender identity disorders (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10-code F64) who underwent chest reconstruction (mastectomy) and genital surgery (phalloplasty, metoidioplasty, and vaginoplasty) in a pediatric academic hospital. The secondary aim is to evaluate the value of a specialized anesthesia team for improving clinical outcomes, interdisciplinary communication, and further advancing the transgender perioperative experience. We identified 204 gender affirmation surgical cases, 177 chests/top surgeries, and 27 genital/bottom surgeries. These findings indicate gender-diverse individuals who underwent life-changing surgery at our institution had a median age of 18 years old, with many patients identifying as transmen. Our data suggests that postoperative pain was significant, but adverse events were minimal. The evolution of a specialty anesthesia team and initiatives (anesthesia management guidelines, scheduling, continuity, and education) necessitate direct care coordination and multidisciplinary planning for gender affirmation surgery in transgender youth.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety problems are common in children, yet few affected children access evidence-based treatment. Digitally augmented psychological therapies bring potential to increase availability of effective help for children with mental health problems. This study aimed to establish whether therapist-supported, digitally augmented, parent-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could increase the efficiency of treatment without compromising clinical effectiveness and acceptability. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, unblinded, two-arm, multisite, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapist-supported, parent-led CBT using the Online Support and Intervention (OSI) for child anxiety platform compared with treatment as usual for child (aged 5-12 years) anxiety problems in 34 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in England and Northern Ireland. We examined acceptability of OSI plus therapist support via qualitative interviews. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OSI plus therapist support or treatment as usual, minimised by child age, gender, service type, and baseline child anxiety interference. Outcomes were assessed at week 14 and week 26 after randomisation. The primary clinical outcome was parent-reported interference caused by child anxiety at week 26 assessment, using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale-parent report (CAIS-P). The primary measure of health economic effect was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Outcome analyses were conducted blind in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with a standardised non-inferiority margin of 0\u00b733 for clinical analyses. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, 12890382. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2020, and Aug 3, 2022, 706 families (706 children and their parents or carers) were referred to the study information. 444 families were enrolled. Parents reported 255 (58%) child participants' gender to be female, 184 (41%) male, three (<1%) other, and one (<1%) preferred not to report their child's gender. 400 (90%) children were White and the mean age was 9\u00b720 years (SD 1\u00b779). 85% of families for whom clinicians provided information in the treatment as usual group received CBT. OSI plus therapist support was non-inferior for parent-reported anxiety interference on the CAIS-P (SMD 0\u00b701, 95% CI -0\u00b715 to 0\u00b717; p<0\u00b70001) and all secondary outcomes. The mean difference in QALYs across trial arms approximated to zero, and OSI plus therapist support was associated with lower costs than treatment as usual. OSI plus therapist support was likely to be cost effective under certain scenarios, but uncertainty was high. OSI plus therapist support acceptability was good. No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Digitally augmented intervention brought promising savings without compromising outcomes and as such presents a valuable tool for increasing access to psychological therapies and meeting the demand for treatment of child anxiety problems.

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cannabis use has been the most commonly used illicit psychoactive substance in India. Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mortality rate for children with septic shock is stil quite high in low-income and middle-income countries (31.7%). One of the most widely used scoring systems to assess mortality in sepsis or septic shock is Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD-2). However, it requires various laboratory evaluations. A non-invasive, fast and easy method is needed to assess the mortality of children with septic shock at an early stage. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the ability of Vascular Reactivity Index (VRI) compared with PELOD-2 score as a predictor of mortality in children with septic shock based on vascular response to vasoactive agents. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from children aged 1\u2009month to 18 years with septic shock treated in the ER and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the tertiary hospital from 2017 to 2021. The serial haemodynamic data were analysed including Systemic Vascular Resistant Index (SVRI) and the cardiac index from ultrasound cardiac output monitoring device was recorded in the first and sixth hours after the diagnosis of septic shock. The VRI was determined by dividing SVRI/Vasoactive Inotropic Score (ie, accumulated doses of dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, milrinone, vasopressin and norepinephrine). The receiver operating curve was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off point. RESULTS: A total of 68 subjects fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the median age was 54 months with a range of 2-204 months and the mortality rate was 47%. The majority of the patients who died were found in the high cardiac index and low SVRI group (17.6%). Moreover, the optimum cut-off point of VRI was obtained to predict mortality in septic shock of 32.1, with 87.5% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. The AUC for predicting death using VRI was 95% (95% CI 90% to 100%, p<0.001) and PELOD-2 92.6% (95% CI 96.4% to 98.8%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The VRI <32.1\u2009may potentially be used to predict mortality in children with septic shock and its predictive ability is as good as PELOD-2. The assessment of VRI is faster and easier than PELOD-2.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine men's satisfaction with and acceptability of a once-daily, oral regimen of dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU) versus placebo when used for 28\u00a0days. STUDY DESIGN: After a Phase I double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating trial of oral DMAU for 28-days, 57 healthy male volunteers completed a survey assessing their experience and satisfaction with the regimen. In the trial, participants were randomized to receive up to 4 DMAU capsules daily versus placebo and instructed to ingest them within 30\u00a0min of consuming a high fat meal. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were performed, followed by a 6-week recovery phase. Participants were counseled that they could not rely on the drug for contraception. RESULTS: Fifty-seven participants were offered acceptability surveys (39 DMAU, 18 placebo). Most respondents, 80% (45/56), reported satisfaction with the method; 77% (44/57) would recommend it. 54% (31/57), reported that, if available, they would use the method as their primary contraceptive. More respondents reported satisfaction with active DMAU than placebo (87% vs. 67%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Most respondents, 91% (52/57), reported no difficulty with having to take up to 4 pills within 30\u00a0min of ingesting a high-fat meal. CONCLUSION: Most participants reported that the study method, daily oral DMAU or placebo, was satisfactory and acceptable. Having to take the drug after a high-fat meal did not detract from acceptability. IMPLICATIONS: Most participants in a 4-week trial of daily DMAU capsules would recommend and use the method. High satisfaction among DMAU and placebo groups affirms acceptability of a daily male contraceptive pill, warranting further study of oral DMAU.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Better risk assessment tools are needed to predict post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM). Using analytic morphomic measurements from computed tomography (CT) scans, we aimed to identify specific measures of body composition associated with PTDM. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 99 non-diabetic kidney transplant recipients who received pre-transplant CT scans at a single institution between 1/2005 and 5/2014. Analytic morphomic techniques were used to measure abdominal adiposity, abdominal size, and psoas muscle area and density, standardized by gender. We measured the associations of these morphomic factors with PTDM. RESULTS: One-year incidence of PTDM was 18%. The morphomic factors significantly associated with PTDM included visceral fat area (OR=1.84 per standard deviation increase, P=.020), body depth (OR=1.79, P=.035), and total body area (OR=1.67, P=.049). Clinical factors significantly associated with PTDM included African American race (OR=3.01, P=.044), hypertension (OR=2.97, P=.041), and dialysis vintage (OR=1.24 per year on dialysis, P=.048). Body mass index was not associated with PTDM (OR=1.05, P=.188). On multivariate modeling, visceral fat area was an independent predictor of PTDM (OR=1.91, P=.035). CONCLUSIONS: Analytic morphomics can identify pre-transplant measurements of body composition that are predictive of PTDM in kidney transplant recipients. Pre-transplant imaging contains a wealth of underutilized data that may inform PTDM prevention strategies.",

To minimize functional impairments, the use of resveratrol as a therapeutic strategy is highlighted due to its neuroprotective and antioxidant effects in different regions of the brain. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of neonatal treatment with resveratrol on postural development, motor function, oxidative balance, and mitochondrial biogenesis in the brain of rats submitted to a cerebral palsy model. Neonatal treatment with resveratrol attenuated deficits in somatic growth, postural development, and muscle strength in rats submitted to cerebral palsy. Related to oxidative balance, resveratrol in cerebral palsy decreased the levels of MDA and carbonyls. Related to mitochondrial biogenesis, was observed in animals with cerebral palsy treated with resveratrol, an increase in mRNA levels of TFAM, in association with the increase of citrate synthase activity. The data demonstrated a promising effect of neonatal resveratrol treatment, improving postural and muscle deficits induced by cerebral palsy. These findings were associated with improvements in oxidative balance and mitochondrial biogenesis in the brain of rats submitted to cerebral palsy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its accurate and timely diagnosis is hindered by vague symptoms and the urgent necessity for early antibiotic intervention. The gold standard for diagnosing the condition is the identification of a pathogenic organism from normally sterile sites via laboratory testing. However, this method is resource-intensive and cannot be conducted continuously. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to predict the onset of late-onset sepsis (LOS) with good diagnostic value as early as possible using non-invasive biosignal measurements from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) monitors. METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study, we developed a multimodal machine learning algorithm based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure that uses the power spectral density (PSD) of recorded biosignals to predict the onset of LOS. This approach aimed to discern LOS-related pathogenic spectral signatures without labor-intensive manual artifact removal. RESULTS: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic score of 0.810 (95\u00a0% CI 0.698-0.922) on the validation dataset. With an optimal operating point, LOS detection had 83\u00a0% sensitivity and 73\u00a0% specificity. The median early detection was 44\u00a0h before clinical suspicion. The results highlighted the additive importance of electrocardiogram and respiratory impedance (RESP) signals in improving predictive accuracy. According to a more detailed analysis, the predictive power arose from the morphology of the electrocardiogram's R-wave and sudden changes in the RESP signal. CONCLUSION: Raw biosignals from NICU monitors, in conjunction with PSD transformation, as input to the CNN, can provide state-of-the-art prediction performance for LOS without the need for artifact removal. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to highlight the independent and additive predictive potential of electrocardiogram R-wave morphology and concurrent, sudden changes in the RESP waveform in predicting the onset of LOS using non-invasive biosignals.",

This has led to the emergence of  OBJECTIVE: This paper analyzes the role and functions of a neuropsychologist in primary schools and the possibilities of his/her collaboration with other specialists in diagnosing children's problems and organizing remediation for problematic kids. DESIGN: We established four steps for launching neuropsychological work at primary schools: 1) setting up a screening group for neuropsychological assessment of all children entering the first year of school; 2) a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of the children who showed poor results in the first step of the study; 3)ateam remediation program; and 4) evaluation of the remediation results by a new neuropsychological assessment at the end of the remediation program. RESULTS: The results of the first step of our study showed a very high percentage of children with cognitive problems- 37% of 202 6-8 year-old schoolchildren entering the first year of school. They formed a group at risk for future learning disabilities and maladjustment at school. Age and gender differences, and the structure of cognitive underdevelopment, were discussed in the second step of our study. In the third step, a team of school specialists, including a neuropsychologist, a teacher, a school psychologist, and a school social worker, implemented a remediation program which was created and supervised by a neuropsychologist. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of the pupils revealed a complex structure of cognitive disturbances which interfere with pupils' learning abilities in primary school. The team approach can efficiently prevent learning disabilities and help children with cognitive underdevelopment and risks of future unsuccess at school, when this collaboration of school specialists has a common theoretical approach and is based upon comprehensive neuropsychological assessment.",

PRIOR STUDIES: Studies of testosterone administered alone or in combination of another gonadotropin suppressive agent such as a progestin or gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog showed decisively that the exogenous hormone administrations are effective in suppressing sperm output with few adverse events that are not anticipated. In contraceptive efficacy studies, testosterone alone or combined with a progestin are as effective in preventing pregnancies as female contraceptive methods. CONCLUSION: Hormone combinations for male contraception are in late-phase clinical trials and hold the promise of being the new, reversible contraception method for men in over half a century.

METHODS: The descriptive study was conducted on 278 children with SLD. Strengths and difficulties in children were evaluated by the SDQ applied to their mothers. The percentage of cases above the cut-off limits of the SDQ was calculated. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis were used for analysis. RESULTS: The mean (SD) total SDQ score was 15.8 (6.5). The percentage of scores of abnormal total difficulties in SLD was 47.8%. Multivariate analysis revealed that cases exposed to antenatal smoking had higher odds ratio of abnormal emotional symptoms and abnormal total difficulties; cases with poor familial income and the presence of a history of antenatal smoking exposure showed considerably higher odds ratio of conduct problems; cases with younger age at the diagnosis of SLD, dyscalculia, extreme duration of preschool screen time (\u22654\u00a0h), and history of hospitalization had significantly higher odds ratio for hyperactivity-inattention problems; and cases having shorter breastfeeding duration had higher odds ratio of peer problems compared to counterparts. CONCLUSION: Children with SLD have a high score on the SDQ. Practitioners could especially give guidance and support to families with financial problems and those having a child with an early age at diagnosis, exposure to antenatal smoking, short breastfeeding period, early age of the first screen use, and long screen exposure duration during the preschool period.",

METHODS: Single-center, retrospective cohort study in children with a diagnosis of sepsis visiting the PED and then admitted to the PICU from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019. Sepsis organ dysfunction scores-pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) (Schlapbach, Matics, Shime), quickSOFA, quickSOFA-L, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD)-2, quickPELOD-2, and Pediatric Multiple Organ Dysfunction score-were calculated during the first 24 hours of admission (day 1) and their performance compared with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and severe sepsis-International Consensus Conference on Pediatric Sepsis(ICCPS)-derived criteria-using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Primary outcome was PICU mortality. Secondary outcomes were: a composite of death and new disability (ie, change from baseline Pediatric Overall Performance Category score \u22651); prolonged PICU length of stay (>5 d); prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) (>3 d). RESULTS: Among 60 patients with sepsis, 4 (6.7%) died, 7 (11.7%) developed new disability, 26 (43.3%) experienced prolonged length of stay, and 21 (35%) prolonged invasive MV. The prognostic ability in mortality discrimination was significantly higher for organ dysfunction scores, with PELOD-2 showing the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.924; 95% confidence interval, 0.837-1.000), significantly better than SIRS 3 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P = 0.009), SIRS 4 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P < 0.001), and severe sepsis (0.924 vs 0.527, P < 0.001). Among secondary outcomes, PELOD-2 performed significantly better than SIRS criteria and severe sepsis to predict prolonged duration of invasive MV, whereas better than severe sepsis to predict \"poor outcome\" (mortality or new disability). CONCLUSIONS: Day 1 organ dysfunction scores performed better in predicting mortality and morbidity outcomes than ICCPS-derived criteria. The PELOD-2 was the organ dysfunction score with the best performance for all outcomes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transmembrane (TMEM) protein genes are a class of proteins that spans membranes and function to many physiological processes. However, there is very little known about TMEM gene expression, especially in cancer tissue. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequence may facilitate the understanding of this poorly characterized protein genes in PDAC. METHODS: We selected the TMEM family genes through the Human Protein Atlas and characterized their expression by single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. Identification of the key TMEM genes was performed through three machine learning algorithms: LASSO, SVM-RFE and RF-SRC. Then, we established TMEM gene riskscore and estimate its implication in predicting survival and response to systematic therapy. Additionally, we explored the difference and impact of TMEM gene expression in PDAC through immunohistochemistry and cell line research. RESULTS: 5 key TMEM genes (ANO1, TMEM59, TMEM204, TMEM205, TMEM92) were selected based on the single-cell analysis and machine learning survival outcomes. Patients stratified into the high and low-risk groups based on TMEM riskscore, were observed with distinct overall survival in internal and external datasets. Moreover, through bulk RNA-sequence and immunohistochemical staining we verified the protein expression of TMEM genes in PDAC and revealed TMEM92 as an essential regulator of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSION: Our study on TMEM gene expression and behavior in PDAC has revealed unique characteristics, offering potential for precise therapeutic approaches. Insights into molecular mechanisms expand understanding of PDAC complexity and TMEM gene roles. Such knowledge may inform targeted therapy development, benefiting patients.",

        "title": "UPRIGHT, a resilience-based intervention to promote mental well-being in schools: study rationale and methodology for a European randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adolescence is crucial period for laying the foundations for healthy development and mental well-being. The increasing prevalence of mental disorders amongst adolescents makes promotion of mental well-being and prevention interventions at schools important. UPRIGHT (Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally implemented in schools to improve and promote mental Health for Teenagers) is designed as a whole school approach (school community, students and families) to promote a culture of mental well-being and prevent mental disorders by enhancing resilience capacities. The present article aims at describing the rationale, conceptual framework, as well as methodology of implementation and evaluation of the UPRIGHT intervention. METHODS: UPRIGHT project is a research and innovation project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement No. 754919 (Duration: 48\u2009months). The theoretical framework has been developed by an innovative and multidisciplinary approach using a co-creation process inside the UPRIGHT Consortium (involving seven institutions from Spain, Italy, Poland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland). Resulted is the UPRIGHT programme with 18 skills related to 4 components: Mindfulness, Coping, Efficacy and Social and Emotional Learning. Among the five Pan-European regions, 34 schools have been currently involved (17 control; 17 intervention) and around 6000 adolescents and their families are foreseen to participate along a 3-year period of evaluation. Effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated as a randomized controlled trial including quantitative and qualitative analysis in the five Pan-European regions representative of the cultural and socioeconomic diversity. The cost-effectiveness assessment will be performed by simulation modelling methods. DISCUSSION: We expect a short- to medium-term improvement of mental well-being in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities. The study may provide robust evidence on intrapersonal, familiar and social environmental resilience factors promoting positive mental well-being.

        "title": "Separating Visuospatial from Visuomotor Coordination in Skill Estimation in Learning Disabled Children: The Eta-Mu Model.",
        "abstract": "Purpose A model aimed at detecting the proportion of visuoperceptive and visuomotor coordination impairment in children with ascertained or suspected learning disability is described. The final purpose is to provide customized rehabilitation programs. Methods In this pilot study, four children (8-9 years) were administered a set of standardized tests to evaluate their ability to perform visuoperceptive and visuomotor tasks. Depending on the individual outcomes, two indexes have been computed from the resulting z-scores: \u03b7 (Eta) that quantifies the visuoperceptive impairment, and \u03bc (Mu) that expresses the alteration in visuomotor coordination. Results A condition of abnormality was evident in each patient: Subjects 1 and 3 suffered mainly from a visuoperceptive alteration (\u03b7 higher than expected), while Subject 4 had reduced visuomotor coordination (\u03bc higher than expected). Subject 2 showed balanced visuoperceptive and visuomotor impairment. Based on the obtained \u03b7 and \u03bc values, each child underwent a customized rehabilitation treatment, then they were examined again. At re-test, \u03b7 or \u03bc turned balanced and z-scores improved in the four patients. Conclusions The Eta/Mu model is effective in detecting the type of damage by quantifying the share of visuoperceptive and visuomotor coordination involvement in dyslexic children, allowing a customized rehabilitative approach. Such an approach, focused on treating the function found to be defective, appears to be effective in rebalancing individual visuomotor and visuoperceptive skills; it should, therefore, be\u00a0taken into consideration when updating the rehabilitation plans of learning disabled children.",

        "title": "Fatigue in older persons: the role of nutrition.",
        "abstract": "Fatigue is defined as a symptom leading to the inability to continue functioning at the expected activity level. It is a highly prevalent symptom, challenging to frame into monodimensional pathophysiological mechanisms. As a result, fatigue is often underestimated in the clinical setting and is wrongly considered an unavoidable consequence of ageing. Several potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue have been proposed, including sleep patterns, autonomic nervous system abnormalities and biological complexity. Inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the most promising mechanisms through which malnutrition may cause fatigue. Not surprisingly, fatigue is highly prevalent in inflammatory conditions (e.g. COVID-19 infection). The nutritional status may also represent a critical factor in the development and presentation of fatigue, which may mimic the exhaustion of the individual's metabolic reserves. For example, the insufficient dietary intake of energy and proteins may determine the catabolism of body fat and muscles, disrupt the homeostatic balance and cause the onset of fatigue. It is necessary to conduct research on fatigue. By characterising its pathophysiological mechanisms, it will be possible to (1) support the design and development of targeted interventions, (2) improve the quality of life of many persons by acting on the symptom and (3) reduce the direct and indirect costs of a burdening condition typical of advancing age. In the present review, we provide an overview of the role that nutrition may play as a determinant of fatigue in older people, also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "abstract": "The effect of cytokines on non-traditional immunological targets under conditions of chronic inflammation is an ongoing subject of study. Fatigue is a symptom often associated with autoimmune diseases. Chronic inflammatory response and activated cell-mediated immunity are associated with cardiovascular myopathies which can be driven by muscle weakness and fatigue. Thus, we hypothesize that immune dysfunction-driven changes in myocyte mitochondria may play a critical role in fatigue-related pathogenesis. We show that persistent low-level expression of IFN-\u03b3 in designated IFN-\u03b3 AU-Rich Element deletion mice (ARE mice) under androgen exposure resulted in mitochondrial and metabolic deficiencies in myocytes from male or castrated ARE mice. Most notably, echocardiography unveiled that low ejection fraction in the left ventricle post-stress correlated with mitochondrial deficiencies, explaining how heart function decreases under stress. We report that inefficiencies and structural changes in mitochondria, with changes to expression of mitochondrial genes, are linked to male-biased fatigue and acute cardiomyopathy under stress. Our work highlights how male androgen hormone backgrounds and active autoimmunity reduce mitochondrial function and the ability to cope with stress and how pharmacological blockade of stress signal protects heart function. These studies provide new insight into the diverse actions of IFN-\u03b3 in fatigue, energy metabolism, and autoimmunity. \u00a9 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate for differences in metabolomic profiles between fatigued and non-fatigued patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) during chemotherapy (CTX). METHOD: Patients were recruited from the department of surgery in a large medical center in Taiwan. In this longitudinal pilot study, the Fatigue Symptom Inventory and fasting blood samples were collected at three assessments (i.e., prior to surgery (T0), three months (T1) and six months (T2) after surgery). Metabolomic profile analysis was used. Multilevel regression and pathway analyses were performed to identify differences in metabolomic profiles between the fatigued and non-fatigued groups. RESULTS: Of the 49 patients, 55.1% (n\u00a0=\u00a027) were in the fatigue group. All of the 15 metabolites that had statistically significant group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interactions in the differential metabolite analysis were entered into the pathway analysis. Two pathways were enriched for these metabolites, namely galactose metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this pilot study suggest that pathways involved in galactose metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis are associated with cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with CRC during CTX. These findings are consistent with the hypotheses that alterations in energy metabolism and increases in inflammation are associated with the development and maintenance of CRF.",

Fatigue occurs in 70% of patients, characterizing primary SS (pSS) and significantly impacting the patient's quality of life. There are some generic and specific instruments used to measure fatigue in SS. The mechanisms involved with fatigue in SS are still poorly understood, but it appears fatigue signaling pathways are more associated with cell protection and defense than with pro-inflammatory pathways. There are no established pharmacological treatment options for fatigue in pSS. So far, exercise and neuromodulation techniques have shown positive effects on fatigue in pSS.

        "abstract": "Fatigue is the most commonly encountered symptom in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). The resulting decrease in quality of life contributes markedly to the societal costs of fatigue. Moreover, fatigue is associated with social dysfunction, increased daytime somnolence, impaired working ability, and increased risk of mortality. Fatigue is not related to the severity of the underlying liver fibrosis or dysfunction. In CLD patients, fatigue manifests with both central symptoms, characterised by cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, apathy, and autonomic dysfunction, and peripheral symptoms, characterised by decreased exercise tolerance and reduced physical activity levels. The pathogenesis of fatigue in CLD is multifactorial and involves changes in the brain-liver axis resulting from changes in inflammatory cytokines or the gut microbiome. Numerous interventions have attempted to alleviate fatigue in CLD by improving its central and peripheral manifestations or the underlying liver disease. Currently, however, there are no widely accepted or effective treatments for fatigue in CLD patients. In this review, we highlight the problem of fatigue in CLD, the current theories regarding its pathogenesis, and current approaches to its treatment.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of childhood mortality. Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population. Taken together, we concluded that the IL-17 signaling pathway serves as a significant potential mechanism of sepsis and provides a promising therapeutic target for sepsis treatment.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects adults, characterized by muscle weakness resulting from the specific death of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. The pathogenesis of ALS is associated with the accumulation of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) proteins and neurofilaments in motor neurons, highlighting the critical need for disease-modifying treatments. Current therapies, such as riluzole and edaravone, provide only symptomatic relief. Recently, tofersen gained approval from the US FDA under the brand name Qalsody as the first and only gene therapy for ALS, addressing a significant pathological aspect of the disease. METHODS: We carried out a literature survey using PubMed, Scopus, National Institutes of Health, and Biogen for articles published in the English language concerned with \"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\", pathophysiology, current treatment, treatment under clinical trial, and the newly approved drug \"tofersen\" and its detailed summary. RESULTS: A comprehensive review of the literature on the pathophysiology, available treatment, and newly approved drug for this condition revealed convincing evidence that we are now able to better monitor and treat ALS.

        "abstract": "Given prior literature focused on the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease framework, there is strong rationale to hypothesize that reducing depression in the prenatal period will cause improvements in offspring cardiometabolic health. The current review outlines evidence that prenatal depression is associated with offspring cardiometabolic risk and health behaviors. We review evidence of these associations in humans and in nonhuman animals at multiple developmental periods, from the prenatal period (maternal preeclampsia, gestational diabetes), neonatal period (preterm birth, small size at birth), infancy (rapid weight gain), childhood and adolescence (high blood pressure, impaired glucose-insulin homeostasis, unfavorable lipid profiles, abdominal obesity), and into adulthood (diabetes, cardiovascular disease). In addition to these cardiometabolic outcomes, we focus on health behaviors associated with cardiometabolic risk, such as child eating behaviors, diet, physical activity, and sleep health. Our review focuses on child behaviors (e.g., emotional eating, preference for highly palatable foods, short sleep duration) and parenting behaviors (e.g., pressuring child to eat, modeling of health behaviors). These changes in health behaviors may be detected before changes to cardiometabolic outcomes, which may allow for early identification of and prevention for children at risk for poor adult cardiometabolic outcomes. We also discuss the methods of the ongoing Care Project, which is a randomized clinical trial to test whether reducing prenatal maternal depression improves offspring's cardiometabolic health and health behaviors in preschool. The goal of this review and the Care Project are to inform future research, interventions, and policies that support prenatal mental health and offspring cardiometabolic health.

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population. Taken together, we concluded that the IL-17 signaling pathway serves as a significant potential mechanism of sepsis and provides a promising therapeutic target for sepsis treatment. This research will further deepen our understanding of sepsis development.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis remains one of the leading causes of mortality in newborns. Several brainstem-regulated physiological processes undergo disruption during neonatal sepsis. Mechanistic knowledge gaps exist at the interplay between metabolism and immune activation to brainstem neural circuits and pertinent physiological functions in neonates. To delineate this association, we induced systemic inflammation either by TLR4 (LPS) or TLR1/2 (PAM3CSK4) ligand administration in postnatal day 5 mice (PD5). Our findings show that LPS and PAM3CSK4 evoke substantial changes in respiration and metabolism. Physiological trade-offs led to hypometabolic-hypothermic responses due to LPS, but not PAM3CSK4, whereas to both TLR ligands blunted respiratory chemoreflexes. Neuroinflammatory pathways modulation in brainstem showed more robust effects in LPS than PAM3CSK4. Brainstem neurons, microglia, and astrocyte gene expression analyses showed unique responses to TLR ligands. PAM3CSK4 did not significantly modulate gene expression changes in GLAST-1 positive brainstem astrocytes. PD5 pups receiving PAM3CSK4 failed to maintain a prolonged metabolic state repression, which correlated to enhanced gasping latency and impaired autoresuscitation during anoxic chemoreflex challenges. In contrast, LPS administered pups showed no significant changes in anoxic chemoreflex. Electrophysiological studies from brainstem slices prepared from pups exposed to either TLR4 or PAM3CSK4 showed compromised transmission between preB\u00f6tzinger complex and Hypoglossal as an exclusive response to the TLR1/2 ligand. Spatial gene expression analysis demonstrated a region-specific modulation of PAM3CSK4 within the raphe nucleus relative to other anatomical sites evaluated. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes due to inflammation might be a crucial tolerance mechanism for neonatal sepsis preserving neural control of breathing.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To study the metabolic mechanism of neonatal sepsis at different stages by analyzing the metabolic pathways involving the serum metabolites with significant differences in neonates with sepsis at different time points after admission. METHODS: A total of 20 neonates with sepsis who were hospitalized in the Department of Neonatology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, from January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2020 were enrolled as the sepsis group. Venous blood samples were collected on days 1, 4, and 7 after admission. Ten healthy neonates who underwent physical examination during the same period were enrolled as the control group. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for the metabonomic analysis of serum samples to investigate the change in metabolomics in neonates with sepsis at different time points. RESULTS: On day 1 after admission, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between the sepsis and control groups were mainly involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid skeleton. For the sepsis group, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 4 after admission were mainly involved in pyruvate metabolism, and those between days 4 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in the metabolism of cysteine and methionine. The differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in ascorbic acid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic mechanism of serum metabolites varies at different stages in neonates with sepsis and is mainly associated with terpenoid skeleton biosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism, cysteine/methionine metabolism, and ascorbic acid metabolism.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide expression profiles have been previously employed as clinical research diagnostic tools for newborn sepsis. We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

The aim of the study was to compare the metabolic profiles of plasma and urine samples collected at birth from preterm neonates with and without earlyonset sepsis (EOS) to identify metabolic perturbations that might orient the search for new early biomarkers. All preterm newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were eligible for this proof-of-concept, prospective case-control study. Infants were enrolled as \"cases\" if they developed EOS, and as \"controls\"if they did not. Plasma samples collected at birth and urine samples collected within 24 h of birth underwent untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis using mass spectrometry coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Of 123 eligible newborns, 15 developed EOS. These 15 newborns matched controls for gestational age and weight. Metabolomic analysis revealed evident clustering of the cases versus controls, with the glutathione and tryptophan metabolic pathways markedly disrupted in the former. In conclusion, neonates with EOS had a metabolic profile at birth that clearly distinguished them from those without sepsis, and metabolites of glutathione and tryptophan pathways are promising as new biomarkers of neonatal sepsis.",

The screened abstracts were independently considered for eligibility by two researchers. PROSPERO ID: CRD42020164454. RESULTS: The search identified in total 762 articles. Fifteen articles were assessed for eligibility. Four studies were included, with totally 78 neonates. The studies used different diagnostic criteria and had between 1 and 16 sepsis cases. All studies with bacterial sepsis found alterations in the glucose and lactate metabolism, reflecting possible redistribution of glucose consumption from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to the lactate and pentose phosphate pathway. We also found signs of increased oxidative stress and fatty acid oxidation in sepsis cases. CONCLUSION: We found signs of metabolomic signatures in neonatal sepsis.

We aim to determine whether peripheral blood gene expression profiles are associated with pathogen type and sepsis severity in children with suspected sepsis. METHODS: This was a prospective pilot observational study in a tertiary pediatric emergency department with a convenience sample of children enrolled. Participants were older than 56 days and younger than 18 years, had suspected sepsis, and had not received broad-spectrum antibiotics in the previous 4 hours. Primary outcome was source pathogen, defined as confirmed bacterial source from sterile body fluid or confirmed viral source. Secondary outcome was sepsis severity, defined as maximum therapy required for shock reversal in the first 3 hospital days. We drew peripheral blood for ribonucleic acid isolation at the sepsis protocol activation, obtained gene expression measures with the GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array, and conducted differential expression analysis. RESULTS: We collected ribonucleic acid samples from a convenience sample of 122 children with suspected sepsis and 12 healthy controls. We compared the 66 children (54%) with confirmed bacterial or viral infection and found 558 differentially expressed genes, many related to interferon signaling or viral immunity. We did not find statistically significant gene expression differences in patients according to sepsis severity. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates feasibility of evaluating gene expression profiling data in children evaluated for sepsis in the pediatric emergency department setting. Our results suggest that gene expression profiling may facilitate identification of source pathogen in children with suspected sepsis, which could ultimately lead to improved tailoring of sepsis treatment and antimicrobial stewardship.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to pyrethroids, a significant class of the most widely used agricultural chemicals, has been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, although many different pyrethroids induce roughly the same symptoms of Parkinsonism, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To find the shared key features among these mechanisms, we focused on 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common and prominent metabolite of most pyrethroids produced via hydrolysis by CEs in mammals. To determine the contribution of 3-PBA to the initiation and progression of PD, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively, and found that 3-PBA not only accumulates in murine brain tissues over time but also further induces PD-like pathologies (increased \u03b1-syn and phospho-S129, decreased TH) to the same or even greater extent than the precursor pyrethroid. A before-after study of PET-DAT in the same mice revealed that low concentrations of 3-PBA (0.5 mg/kg) could paradoxically cause DAT to increase (22.46% higher than pre-drug test). The intervention of DAT inhibitors and activators respectively alleviated and enhanced the dopaminergic toxicity of 3-PBA, indicating that 3-PBA interacts with DAT. In particular, low concentrations of 3-PBA increase the DAT, which in turn induces 3-PBA to enter the dopaminergic neurons to exert toxic effects. Finally, we described a mechanism underlying this potential role of 3-PBA in the pathological aggregation of \u03b1-syn. Specifically, 3-PBA was found to dysregulate C/EBP \u03b2 levels and further anomalously activate AEP in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by increased accumulation of pathologically cleaved \u03b1-syn (N103 fragments) and accelerated \u03b1-syn aggregation. All these results suggest that 3-PBA exposure could mimic the pathological and pathogenetic features of PD, showing that this metabolite is a key pathogenic compound in pyrethroid-related pathological effects and a possible dopamine neurotoxin. Additionally, our findings provide a crucial reference for the primary prevention of PD.",

        "abstract": "The present study examined genetic, prenatal, and postnatal environmental pathways in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and depressive symptoms from parents to early adolescents (when these symptoms start to increase), while considering timing effects of exposure to parent anxiety and depressive symptoms postnatally. The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

        "title": "Digitally augmented, parent-led CBT versus treatment as usual for child anxiety problems in child mental health services in England and Northern Ireland: a pragmatic, non-inferiority, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety problems are common in children, yet few affected children access evidence-based treatment. Digitally augmented psychological therapies bring potential to increase availability of effective help for children with mental health problems. This study aimed to establish whether therapist-supported, digitally augmented, parent-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could increase the efficiency of treatment without compromising clinical effectiveness and acceptability. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, unblinded, two-arm, multisite, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapist-supported, parent-led CBT using the Online Support and Intervention (OSI) for child anxiety platform compared with treatment as usual for child (aged 5-12 years) anxiety problems in 34 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in England and Northern Ireland. We examined acceptability of OSI plus therapist support via qualitative interviews. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OSI plus therapist support or treatment as usual, minimised by child age, gender, service type, and baseline child anxiety interference. Outcomes were assessed at week 14 and week 26 after randomisation. The primary clinical outcome was parent-reported interference caused by child anxiety at week 26 assessment, using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale-parent report (CAIS-P). The primary measure of health economic effect was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Outcome analyses were conducted blind in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with a standardised non-inferiority margin of 0\u00b733 for clinical analyses. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, 12890382. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2020, and Aug 3, 2022, 706 families (706 children and their parents or carers) were referred to the study information. 444 families were enrolled. Parents reported 255 (58%) child participants' gender to be female, 184 (41%) male, three (<1%) other, and one (<1%) preferred not to report their child's gender. 400 (90%) children were White and the mean age was 9\u00b720 years (SD 1\u00b779). 85% of families for whom clinicians provided information in the treatment as usual group received CBT. OSI plus therapist support was non-inferior for parent-reported anxiety interference on the CAIS-P (SMD 0\u00b701, 95% CI -0\u00b715 to 0\u00b717; p<0\u00b70001) and all secondary outcomes. The mean difference in QALYs across trial arms approximated to zero, and OSI plus therapist support was associated with lower costs than treatment as usual. OSI plus therapist support was likely to be cost effective under certain scenarios, but uncertainty was high. OSI plus therapist support acceptability was good. No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Digitally augmented intervention brought promising savings without compromising outcomes and as such presents a valuable tool for increasing access to psychological therapies and meeting the demand for treatment of child anxiety problems.

        "title": "Elucidating Conserved Transcriptional Networks Underlying Pesticide Exposure and Parkinson's Disease: A Focus on Chemicals of Epidemiological Relevance.",
        "abstract": "While a number of genetic mutations are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), it is also widely acknowledged that the environment plays a significant role in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Epidemiological evidence suggests that occupational exposure to pesticides (e.g., dieldrin, paraquat, rotenone, maneb, and ziram) is associated with a higher risk of developing PD in susceptible populations. Within dopaminergic neurons, environmental chemicals can have an array of adverse effects resulting in cell death, such as aberrant redox cycling and oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, unfolded protein response, ubiquitin-proteome system dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and metabolic disruption. More recently, our understanding of how pesticides affect cells of the central nervous system has been strengthened by computational biology. New insight has been gained about transcriptional and proteomic networks, and the metabolic pathways perturbed by pesticides. These networks and cell signaling pathways constitute potential therapeutic targets for intervention to slow or mitigate neurodegenerative diseases. Here we review the epidemiological evidence that supports a role for specific pesticides in the etiology of PD and identify molecular profiles amongst these pesticides that may contribute to the disease. Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, these transcripts were compared to those regulated by the PD-associated neurotoxicant MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine). While many transcripts are already established as those related to PD (alpha-synuclein, caspases, leucine rich repeat kinase 2, and parkin2), lesser studied targets have emerged as \"pesticide/PD-associated transcripts\" [e.g., phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class C (Pigc), allograft inflammatory factor 1 (Aif1), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3, and DNA damage inducible transcript 4]. We also compared pesticide-regulated genes to a recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in PD which revealed new genetic mutant alleles; the pesticides under review regulated the expression of many of these genes (e.g., ELOVL fatty acid elongase 7, ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a1, and bridging integrator 3). The significance is that these proteins may contribute to pesticide-related increases in PD risk. This review collates information on transcriptome responses to PD-associated pesticides to develop a mechanistic framework for quantifying PD risk with exposures.",

        "title": "Combined exposure to agriculture pesticides, paraquat and maneb, induces alterations in the N/OFQ-NOPr and PDYN/KOPr systems in rats: Relevance to sporadic Parkinson's disease.",
        "abstract": "Despite several years of research, the aetiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is quite far from being solved. In PD, as well as in other neurodegenerative disorders, it has been proposed that the combination of multiple factors might contribute to the onset of the disease. Indeed, several authors have suggested that environmental factors, such as pollutants and chemicals, might be associated with the onset of several neurodegenerative disorders. On the other hand, several studies have described that the nociceptin/orphanin-NOP and prodynorphin-KOP opioid systems are implicated in the pathology of Parkinson's disease. Considering the nonrestricted commercial availability and common use of several pesticides, such as paraquat and maneb, in agriculture of less developed countries, the aim of our study was to investigate the involvement of nociceptin/orphanin-NOP and prodynorphin-KOP systems in a chronic paraquat and maneb animal model of Parkinson's disease. Our results showed that after paraquat/maneb (5/15 mg kg(-1) ) treatment, a significant reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis, was observed. Also, the association of paraquat and maneb (5/15 mg kg(-1) ) induced an increase in nociceptin/orphanin and a decrease of prodynorphin gene expression levels in the substantia nigra with a down-regulation of NOP and KOP receptors after both treatments in the substantia nigra and caudate putamen. These data further confirm that paraquat and maneb toxicity can modulate gene expression of the nociceptin/orphanin-NOP receptor and prodynorphin-KOP receptor systems in the substantia nigra and caudate putamen, offering further support to the hypothesis that chronic exposure to these agrochemicals might be implicated in the mechanisms underlying sporadic Parkinson's disease. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition, occurring when an infectious agent invades the body, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2\u03bcg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin. Early detection of bacteria followed by antimicrobial susceptibility test can help by selection of appropriate antibiotic and prevent spread of infection.",

The amounts of Th17 cells, IL-17A, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, and lipopolysaccharide is significantly elevated in sepsis patients. The increased differentiation of Th17 cells can promote lung cell pyroptosis and induce hyperpermeability via activating NLRP3 inflammasome and p38 pathway. The inhibitors targeting Th17 cells, NLRP3 inflammasome, and p38 pathway can significantly alleviate lung injury in sepsis mice.

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population.

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of childhood mortality. Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

        "abstract": "Transmembrane proteins (TMEM) are located in the different biological membranes of the cell and have at least one passage through these cellular compartments. TMEM proteins carry out a wide variety of functions necessary to maintain cell homeostasis TMEM165 participates in glycosylation protein, TMEM88 in the development of cardiomyocytes, TMEM45A in epidermal keratinization, and TMEM74 regulating autophagy. However, for many TMEM proteins, their physiological function remains unknown. The role of these proteins is being recently investigated in cancer since transcriptomic and proteomic studies have revealed that exits differential expression of TMEM proteins in different neoplasms concerning cancer-free tissues. Among the cellular processes in which TMEM proteins have been involved in cancer are the promotion or suppression of cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, migration, intravasation/extravasation, metastasis, modulation of the immune response, and response to antineoplastic drugs. Inclusive data suggests that the participation of TMEM proteins in these cellular events could be carried out through involvement in different cell signaling pathways. However, the exact mechanisms not clear. This review shows a description of the involvement of TMEM proteins that promote or decrease cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in cancer cells, describes those TMEM proteins for which both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter role have been identified, depending on the type of cancer in which the protein is expressed.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide expression profiles have been previously employed as clinical research diagnostic tools for newborn sepsis. We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

        "title": "Male contraception: narrative review of ongoing research.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the release of the combined oral contraceptive pill in 1960, women have shouldered the burden of contraception and family planning. Over 60 years later, this is still the case as the only practical, effective contraceptive options available to men are condoms and vasectomy. However, there are now a variety of promising hormonal and non-hormonal male contraceptive options being studied. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide clinicians and laypeople with focused, up-to-date descriptions of novel strategies and targets for male contraception. We include a cautiously optimistic discussion of benefits and potential drawbacks, highlighting several methods in preclinical and clinical stages of development. RESULTS: As of June 2023, two hormonal male contraceptive methods are undergoing phase II clinical trials for safety and efficacy. A large-scale, international phase IIb trial investigating efficacy of transdermal segesterone acetate (Nestorone) plus testosterone gel has enrolled over 460 couples with completion estimated for late 2024. A second hormonal method, dimethandrolone undecanoate, is in two clinical trials focusing on safety, pharmacodynamics, suppression of spermatogenesis and hormones; the first of these two is estimated for completion in December 2024. There are also several non-hormonal methods with strong potential in preclinical stages of development. CONCLUSIONS: There exist several hurdles to novel male contraception. Therapeutic development takes decades of time, meticulous work, and financial investment, but with so many strong candidates it is our hope that there will soon be several safe, effective, and reversible contraceptive options available to male patients. R\u00e9SUM\u00e9: CONTEXTE: Depuis la sortie de la pilule contraceptive orale combin\u00e9e en 1960, les femmes ont assum\u00e9 le fardeau de la contraception et de la planification familiale. Plus de 60 ans plus tard, c\u2019est toujours le cas, car les seules options contraceptives pratiques et efficaces disponibles pour les hommes sont les pr\u00e9servatifs et la vasectomie. Cependant, il existe maintenant une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019options contraceptives masculines hormonales et non hormonales prometteuses qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude. Le but de cette revue narrative est de fournir aux cliniciens et aux profanes des descriptions cibl\u00e9es et \u00e0 jour de nouvelles strat\u00e9gies et cibles pour la contraception masculine.

The purpose of the present study was to identify candidate genes of preterm infants who are susceptible to RSV infection and provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of RSV infection. METHODS: Three datasets (GSE77087, GSE69606 and GSE41374) containing 183 blood samples of RSV infected patients and 33 blood samples of healthy controls from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were downloaded and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out. The function and pathway enrichments were analyzed through Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for DEGs was constructed through Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). The module analysis was performed by Cytoscape software and hub genes were identified. Clinical verification was employed to verify the expression level of top five hub genes among 72 infants including 50 RSV infected patients and 22 non-RSV-infected patients hospitalized in our center. Further, the RSV infected infants with high-expression IFI27 and those with low-expression IFI27 were compared (defined as higher or lower than the median mRNA level). Finally, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) focusing on IFI27 was carried out. RESULTS: Totally, 4028 DEGs were screened out and among which, 131 most significant DEGs were selected. Subsequently, 13 hub genes were identified, and function and pathway enrichments of hub genes mainly were: response to virus, defense response to virus, regulation of viral genome replication and regulation of viral life cycle. Furthermore, IFI27 was confirmed to be the most significantly expressed in clinical verification. Gene sets associated with calcium signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix receptor interaction and so on were significantly enriched when IFI27 was highly expressed. Moreover, high-expression IFI27 was associated with more severe cases (p\u2009=\u20090.041), more requirements of mechanical ventilation (p\u2009=\u20090.034), more frequent hospitalization (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and longer cumulative hospital stay (p\u2009=\u20090.012).

        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Overrepresentation analysis (ORA) is used widely to assess the enrichment of functional categories in a gene list compared to a background list. ORA is therefore a critical method in the interpretation of 'omics data, relating gene lists to biological functions and themes. Although ORA is hugely popular, we and others have noticed two potentially undesired behaviours of some ORA tools. The first one we call the 'background problem', because it involves the software eliminating large numbers of genes from the background list if they are not annotated as belonging to any category. The second one we call the 'false discovery rate problem', because some tools underestimate the true number of parallel tests conducted. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate the impact of these issues on several real RNA-seq datasets and use simulated RNA-seq data to quantify the impact of these problems. We show that the severity of these problems depends on the gene set library, the number of genes in the list, and the degree of noise in the dataset. These problems can be mitigated by changing packages/websites for ORA or by changing to another approach such as functional class scoring.

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population. Taken together, we concluded that the IL-17 signaling pathway serves as a significant potential mechanism of sepsis and provides a promising therapeutic target for sepsis treatment.

However, there is very little known about TMEM gene expression, especially in cancer tissue. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequence may facilitate the understanding of this poorly characterized protein genes in PDAC. METHODS: We selected the TMEM family genes through the Human Protein Atlas and characterized their expression by single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. Identification of the key TMEM genes was performed through three machine learning algorithms: LASSO, SVM-RFE and RF-SRC. Then, we established TMEM gene riskscore and estimate its implication in predicting survival and response to systematic therapy. Additionally, we explored the difference and impact of TMEM gene expression in PDAC through immunohistochemistry and cell line research. RESULTS: 5 key TMEM genes (ANO1, TMEM59, TMEM204, TMEM205, TMEM92) were selected based on the single-cell analysis and machine learning survival outcomes. Patients stratified into the high and low-risk groups based on TMEM riskscore, were observed with distinct overall survival in internal and external datasets. Moreover, through bulk RNA-sequence and immunohistochemical staining we verified the protein expression of TMEM genes in PDAC and revealed TMEM92 as an essential regulator of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSION: Our study on TMEM gene expression and behavior in PDAC has revealed unique characteristics, offering potential for precise therapeutic approaches.

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis remains one of the leading causes of mortality in newborns. Several brainstem-regulated physiological processes undergo disruption during neonatal sepsis. Mechanistic knowledge gaps exist at the interplay between metabolism and immune activation to brainstem neural circuits and pertinent physiological functions in neonates. To delineate this association, we induced systemic inflammation either by TLR4 (LPS) or TLR1/2 (PAM3CSK4) ligand administration in postnatal day 5 mice (PD5). Our findings show that LPS and PAM3CSK4 evoke substantial changes in respiration and metabolism. Physiological trade-offs led to hypometabolic-hypothermic responses due to LPS, but not PAM3CSK4, whereas to both TLR ligands blunted respiratory chemoreflexes. Neuroinflammatory pathways modulation in brainstem showed more robust effects in LPS than PAM3CSK4. Brainstem neurons, microglia, and astrocyte gene expression analyses showed unique responses to TLR ligands. PAM3CSK4 did not significantly modulate gene expression changes in GLAST-1 positive brainstem astrocytes. PD5 pups receiving PAM3CSK4 failed to maintain a prolonged metabolic state repression, which correlated to enhanced gasping latency and impaired autoresuscitation during anoxic chemoreflex challenges. In contrast, LPS administered pups showed no significant changes in anoxic chemoreflex. Electrophysiological studies from brainstem slices prepared from pups exposed to either TLR4 or PAM3CSK4 showed compromised transmission between preB\u00f6tzinger complex and Hypoglossal as an exclusive response to the TLR1/2 ligand. Spatial gene expression analysis demonstrated a region-specific modulation of PAM3CSK4 within the raphe nucleus relative to other anatomical sites evaluated.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS.

Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended.

Moreover, high-expression IFI27 was associated with more severe cases (p\u2009=\u20090.041), more requirements of mechanical ventilation (p\u2009=\u20090.034), more frequent hospitalization (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and longer cumulative hospital stay (p\u2009=\u20090.012). CONCLUSION: IFI27 might serve to predict RSV infection and evaluate the severity of RSV infection in preterm infants.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide expression profiles have been previously employed as clinical research diagnostic tools for newborn sepsis. We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

However, an excess or deficiency of iron is related to certain pathologies. The maintenance of iron homeostasis is essential to avoid certain pathologies related to iron excess or deficiency. The existence of iron deposits in postmortem tissues of Parkinson's patients has been interpreted as evidence that iron plays a fundamental role in the degenerative process of the nigrostriatal system in this disease. The use of iron chelators has been successful in the treatment of diseases such as transfusion-dependent thalassemia and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. However, a clinical study with the iron chelator deferiprone in patients with Parkinson's disease has not shown positive effects but rather worsened clinical symptoms.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare, life-threatening, genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. Treatment in RTT encounters many challenges. Trofinetide, a modified amino-terminal tripeptide of insulin-like growth factor 1, has demonstrated clinically promising results in RTT. In this study, trofinetide efficacy and safety in RTT are systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed. METHODS: A systematic search of five electronic databases was conducted until January 2024. Review Manager 5.4 software was used for the analysis. The analysis was based on a weighted mean difference and standard error with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, and a statistically significant P-value was considered if it was\u2009<\u20090.05. The study was registered on PROSPERO with registration number CRD42024499849. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS: Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 276 patients were included in the analysis. Trofinetide improved both caregiver outcomes and clinical scales by improving the Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ) (mean difference (MD):\u2009-\u20093.46 points, 95% CI:\u2009-\u20095.63 to\u2009-\u20091.27, P\u2009=\u20090.0002) and Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I) (MD:\u2009-\u20090.35, 95% CI:\u2009-\u20090.51 to\u2009-\u20090.18, P\u2009<\u20090.0001), respectively. However, trofinetide neither improved the Caregiver Top 3 Concerns Visual Analog Scale nor the Rett Motor Behavioral Assessment. Regarding safety, trofinetide was significantly associated with vomiting compared to placebo (odds ratio (OR): 3.17, 95% CI: 1.57 to 6.43, P\u2009=\u20090.001). After solving heterogeneity, results showed a statistically significant incidence of diarrhea in the trofinetide (200\u00a0mg) group compared to placebo (OR: 18.51, 95% CI: 9.30 to 36.84, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Trofinetide demonstrated statistically significant improvements in CGI-I and RSBQ in pediatrics and adult patients with Rett. Side effects are limited to vomiting and diarrhea. Although diarrhea yielded an insignificant result in our analysis, it emerged as a cause for treatment discontinuation in the participating trials, and a statistically significant risk for diarrhea emerged when excluding the study using a lower dose of the drug, hence causing heterogeneity, in the\u00a0meta-analysis. Given the diverse genetic landscape of RTT, future RCTs investigating correlations between RTT genotype and phenotypic improvements by trofinetide will be beneficial. RCTs encompassing male patients with larger and longer cohorts are recommended.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to pyrethroids, a significant class of the most widely used agricultural chemicals, has been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, although many different pyrethroids induce roughly the same symptoms of Parkinsonism, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To find the shared key features among these mechanisms, we focused on 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common and prominent metabolite of most pyrethroids produced via hydrolysis by CEs in mammals. To determine the contribution of 3-PBA to the initiation and progression of PD, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively, and found that 3-PBA not only accumulates in murine brain tissues over time but also further induces PD-like pathologies (increased \u03b1-syn and phospho-S129, decreased TH) to the same or even greater extent than the precursor pyrethroid. A before-after study of PET-DAT in the same mice revealed that low concentrations of 3-PBA (0.5 mg/kg) could paradoxically cause DAT to increase (22.46% higher than pre-drug test). The intervention of DAT inhibitors and activators respectively alleviated and enhanced the dopaminergic toxicity of 3-PBA, indicating that 3-PBA interacts with DAT. In particular, low concentrations of 3-PBA increase the DAT, which in turn induces 3-PBA to enter the dopaminergic neurons to exert toxic effects. Finally, we described a mechanism underlying this potential role of 3-PBA in the pathological aggregation of \u03b1-syn. Specifically, 3-PBA was found to dysregulate C/EBP \u03b2 levels and further anomalously activate AEP in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by increased accumulation of pathologically cleaved \u03b1-syn (N103 fragments) and accelerated \u03b1-syn aggregation. All these results suggest that 3-PBA exposure could mimic the pathological and pathogenetic features of PD, showing that this metabolite is a key pathogenic compound in pyrethroid-related pathological effects and a possible dopamine neurotoxin. Additionally, our findings provide a crucial reference for the primary prevention of PD.",

        "title": "Early detection of late-onset neonatal sepsis from noninvasive biosignals using deep learning: A multicenter prospective development and validation study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its accurate and timely diagnosis is hindered by vague symptoms and the urgent necessity for early antibiotic intervention. The gold standard for diagnosing the condition is the identification of a pathogenic organism from normally sterile sites via laboratory testing. However, this method is resource-intensive and cannot be conducted continuously. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to predict the onset of late-onset sepsis (LOS) with good diagnostic value as early as possible using non-invasive biosignal measurements from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) monitors. METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study, we developed a multimodal machine learning algorithm based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure that uses the power spectral density (PSD) of recorded biosignals to predict the onset of LOS. This approach aimed to discern LOS-related pathogenic spectral signatures without labor-intensive manual artifact removal. RESULTS: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic score of 0.810 (95\u00a0% CI 0.698-0.922) on the validation dataset. With an optimal operating point, LOS detection had 83\u00a0% sensitivity and 73\u00a0% specificity. The median early detection was 44\u00a0h before clinical suspicion. The results highlighted the additive importance of electrocardiogram and respiratory impedance (RESP) signals in improving predictive accuracy. According to a more detailed analysis, the predictive power arose from the morphology of the electrocardiogram's R-wave and sudden changes in the RESP signal. CONCLUSION: Raw biosignals from NICU monitors, in conjunction with PSD transformation, as input to the CNN, can provide state-of-the-art prediction performance for LOS without the need for artifact removal. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to highlight the independent and additive predictive potential of electrocardiogram R-wave morphology and concurrent, sudden changes in the RESP waveform in predicting the onset of LOS using non-invasive biosignals.",

        "abstract": "The potential health effects of exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) remain largely unexplored. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "The increasing consumption of rare earth elements (REEs) has resulted in a considerable risk of environmental exposure. However, the adverse effects of prenatal REEs exposure on children's neurodevelopment are not yet fully recognized. Therefore, we investigated the individual and joint effects of prenatal exposure to 13 REEs on children's neurocognitive development based on 809 mother-child pairs from a large birth cohort in Wuhan, China. Maternal urinary concentrations of 13 REEs were repeatedly measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Children's neurodevelopment [e.g., mental and psychomotor development index (MDI/PDI)] at 24-months was assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development of Chinese Revision. GEE and BKMR models were applied to estimate the individual and joint effects of prenatal REE exposure on child neurodevelopment level. After controlling for typical confounders, we observed that exposure to 9 REEs during the first trimester were significantly associated with decreased MDI scores [\u03b2s and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) ranging from -2.24 (-3.86\u00a0\u223c\u00a0-0.63) to -1.44 (-2.26\u223c -0.26)], and 7 REEs during third trimester were significantly associated decreased PDI scores [\u03b2 and 95% CIs ranging from -1.95 (-3.19\u00a0\u223c\u00a0-0.71) to -1.25 (-2.34\u00a0\u223c\u00a0-0.16)].

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Germany, approximately three million children under the age of eighteen have a mentally ill parent. These children are at an increased risk of developing a mental illness themselves (1) as well as a physical illness (2). While research has identified numerous evidence-based family-oriented interventions, little is known about how to implement such interventions effectively and efficiently in clinical practice in Germany. This implementation study (ci-chimps) evaluates three clinical implementation projects with three different implementation interventions for the optimal implementation of the tailored family-oriented preventive and therapeutic interventions in the CHIMPS-NET (children of mentally ill parents-research network) with an implementation model for children of mentally ill parents. METHODS: A two-group randomized controlled multicenter trial will examine changes in family-oriented practice and aspects of implementation at baseline as well as at 12- and 24-months follow-up. The CHIMPS-Network consists of 20 clinical centers. The centers in the intervention group receive the support of all of the three implementation interventions: (1) optimal pathways to care, (2) education and a training program for professionals, and (3) systematic screening for children. The centers in the control group do not receive this specific implementation support. DISCUSSION: While we know that children of mentally ill parents are an important target group to be addressed by preventive and therapeutic interventions, there is often a lack of structured implementation of family-oriented interventions in clinical practice in Germany. Using a randomized controlled multicenter trial design with a large and wide-ranging sample (clinics for adult psychiatry and clinics for child and adolescent psychiatry, university clinics and clinics at the real health care) will provide a robust understanding of implementing family-oriented changes in German clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The CHIMPS-NET-study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register on 2019-12-19 (DRKS00020380) and with Clinical Trials on 2020-4-30 (NCT04369625), the ci-chimps-study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00026217) on 2021-08-27, the Clinical Trials registration is in review process.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection.

        "title": "Elucidating Conserved Transcriptional Networks Underlying Pesticide Exposure and Parkinson's Disease: A Focus on Chemicals of Epidemiological Relevance.",
        "abstract": "While a number of genetic mutations are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), it is also widely acknowledged that the environment plays a significant role in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Epidemiological evidence suggests that occupational exposure to pesticides (e.g., dieldrin, paraquat, rotenone, maneb, and ziram) is associated with a higher risk of developing PD in susceptible populations. Within dopaminergic neurons, environmental chemicals can have an array of adverse effects resulting in cell death, such as aberrant redox cycling and oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, unfolded protein response, ubiquitin-proteome system dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and metabolic disruption. More recently, our understanding of how pesticides affect cells of the central nervous system has been strengthened by computational biology. New insight has been gained about transcriptional and proteomic networks, and the metabolic pathways perturbed by pesticides. These networks and cell signaling pathways constitute potential therapeutic targets for intervention to slow or mitigate neurodegenerative diseases. Here we review the epidemiological evidence that supports a role for specific pesticides in the etiology of PD and identify molecular profiles amongst these pesticides that may contribute to the disease. Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, these transcripts were compared to those regulated by the PD-associated neurotoxicant MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine). While many transcripts are already established as those related to PD (alpha-synuclein, caspases, leucine rich repeat kinase 2, and parkin2), lesser studied targets have emerged as \"pesticide/PD-associated transcripts\" [e.g., phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class C (Pigc), allograft inflammatory factor 1 (Aif1), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3, and DNA damage inducible transcript 4]. We also compared pesticide-regulated genes to a recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in PD which revealed new genetic mutant alleles; the pesticides under review regulated the expression of many of these genes (e.g., ELOVL fatty acid elongase 7, ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a1, and bridging integrator 3). The significance is that these proteins may contribute to pesticide-related increases in PD risk. This review collates information on transcriptome responses to PD-associated pesticides to develop a mechanistic framework for quantifying PD risk with exposures.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition, occurring when an infectious agent invades the body, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2\u03bcg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin. Early detection of bacteria followed by antimicrobial susceptibility test can help by selection of appropriate antibiotic and prevent spread of infection.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection.

        "title": "Epidemiology and Immune Pathogenesis of Viral Sepsis.",
        "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can be caused by a broad range of pathogens; however, bacterial infections represent the majority of sepsis cases. Up to 42% of sepsis presentations are culture negative, suggesting a non-bacterial cause. Despite this, diagnosis of viral sepsis remains very rare. Almost any virus can cause sepsis in vulnerable patients (e.g., neonates, infants, and other immunosuppressed groups). The prevalence of viral sepsis is not known, nor is there enough information to make an accurate estimate. The initial standard of care for all cases of sepsis, even those that are subsequently proven to be culture negative, is the immediate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the absence of definite diagnostic criteria for viral sepsis, or at least to exclude bacterial sepsis, this inevitably leads to unnecessary antimicrobial use, with associated consequences for antimicrobial resistance, effects on the host microbiome and excess healthcare costs. It is important to understand non-bacterial causes of sepsis so that inappropriate treatment can be minimised, and appropriate treatments can be developed to improve outcomes. In this review, we summarise what is known about viral sepsis, its most common causes, and how the immune responses to severe viral infections can contribute to sepsis. We also discuss strategies to improve our understanding of viral sepsis, and ways we can integrate this new information into effective treatment.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite a high mortality rate in childhood, there is limited evidence on the causes and outcomes of paediatric bloodstream infections from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize the bacterial causes of paediatric bloodstream infections in LMICs and their resistance profile. METHODS: We searched Pubmed and Embase databases between January 1st 1990 and October 30th 2019, combining MeSH and free-text terms for \"sepsis\" and \"low-middle-income countries\" in children. Two reviewers screened articles and performed data extraction to identify studies investigating children (1\u2009month-18\u2009years), with at least one blood culture. The main outcomes of interests were the rate of positive blood cultures, the distribution of bacterial pathogens, the resistance patterns and the case-fatality rate. The proportions obtained from each study were pooled using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation, and a random-effect meta-analysis model was used. RESULTS: We identified 2403 eligible studies, 17 were included in the final review including 52,915 children (11 in Africa and 6 in Asia). The overall percentage of positive blood culture was 19.1% [95% CI: 12.0-27.5%]; 15.5% [8.4-24.4%] in Africa and 28.0% [13.2-45.8%] in Asia. A total of 4836 bacterial isolates were included in the studies; 2974 were Gram-negative (63.9% [52.2-74.9]) and 1858 were Gram-positive (35.8% [24.9-47.5]). In Asia,  CONCLUSIONS: We observed a marked variation in pathogen distribution and their resistance profiles between Asia and Africa.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide expression profiles have been previously employed as clinical research diagnostic tools for newborn sepsis. We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

These elements include recognition of changes in clinical condition and vital signs, such as fever, tachycardia, and changes in peripheral perfusion, which should raise concern for sepsis; initial stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation; timely administration of empiric antimicrobial therapy; use of fluid boluses and vasoactive medications; and specific considerations in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as the use of corticosteroids for possible adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic-adrenal suppression. Two changes from previous guidelines are the concern for fluid overload, implying the need for clinical re-assessment after administration of each fluid bolus, and the removal of dopamine as the initial vasoactive agent for use in hypotensive paediatric patients, with recommendations for the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine as dictated by the clinical context.

The cohort study described here is designed as a large-scale clinical validation of this previous work. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre observational study will prospectively recruit a total of 1445 newborn infants (all gestations)-1084 with suspected early-or late-onset sepsis, and 361 controls-over 4\u2009years. A small volume of whole blood will be collected from infants with suspected sepsis at the time of presentation. This sample will be used for integrated transcriptomic, lipidomic and targeted proteomics profiling. In addition, a subset of samples will be subjected to cellular phenotype and proteomic analyses. A second sample from the same patient will be collected at 24 hours, with an opportunistic sampling for stool culture. For control infants, only one set of blood and stool sample will be collected to coincide with clinical blood sampling. Along with detailed clinical information, blood and stool samples will be analysed and the information will be used to identify and validate the efficacy of immune-metabolic networks in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal sepsis and to identify new host biomarkers for viral sepsis.

Fifteen articles were assessed for eligibility. Four studies were included, with totally 78 neonates. The studies used different diagnostic criteria and had between 1 and 16 sepsis cases. All studies with bacterial sepsis found alterations in the glucose and lactate metabolism, reflecting possible redistribution of glucose consumption from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to the lactate and pentose phosphate pathway. We also found signs of increased oxidative stress and fatty acid oxidation in sepsis cases. CONCLUSION: We found signs of metabolomic signatures in neonatal sepsis. This may lead to better understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and detection of new candidate biomarkers. Results should be validated in large-scale multicentre studies.",

We drew peripheral blood for ribonucleic acid isolation at the sepsis protocol activation, obtained gene expression measures with the GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array, and conducted differential expression analysis. RESULTS: We collected ribonucleic acid samples from a convenience sample of 122 children with suspected sepsis and 12 healthy controls. We compared the 66 children (54%) with confirmed bacterial or viral infection and found 558 differentially expressed genes, many related to interferon signaling or viral immunity. We did not find statistically significant gene expression differences in patients according to sepsis severity. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates feasibility of evaluating gene expression profiling data in children evaluated for sepsis in the pediatric emergency department setting. Our results suggest that gene expression profiling may facilitate identification of source pathogen in children with suspected sepsis, which could ultimately lead to improved tailoring of sepsis treatment and antimicrobial stewardship.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Male contraception with exogenously administered hormones suppresses both luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone leading to low intratesticular testosterone concentration. This results in reversible suppression of spermatogenesis and marked decrease in sperm output in the ejaculate and preventing pregnancy in the female partner. PRIOR STUDIES: Studies of testosterone administered alone or in combination of another gonadotropin suppressive agent such as a progestin or gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog showed decisively that the exogenous hormone administrations are effective in suppressing sperm output with few adverse events that are not anticipated. In contraceptive efficacy studies, testosterone alone or combined with a progestin are as effective in preventing pregnancies as female contraceptive methods. CONCLUSION: Hormone combinations for male contraception are in late-phase clinical trials and hold the promise of being the new, reversible contraception method for men in over half a century. Lessons learned from the male hormonal contraceptive development pave the way for new targeted approached to regulate male fertility.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that embryo donation can be a successful treatment for infertile couples,<br />however the willingness of Dutch couples to donate or accept embryos was unknown. The aim of this article is to<br />describe the protocol and results for altruistic embryo donation of the only embryo bank in the Netherlands.<br />Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive study. Since 2011, donated cryo-embryos from couples that have undergone<br />in vitro-fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) treatments, are being stored in our embryo<br />bank. The majority of the donated embryos were frozen on day 3 or 4 by slow freezing techniques. We perform a<br />thorough medical and psychological screening of donor couples and recipients, according to the protocol drawn up in<br />close collaboration with the Dutch Ministry of Health.<br />Results: Up to June 2021, 54 women have received embryos from our embryo bank, all single embryo transfers.<br />While the clinical pregnancy rate in 'unknown' embryo donations was relatively high (25.3%), the live birth rate<br />shows limited success (12.6%), partly due to high pregnancy loss through miscarriage. In known donation procedures,<br />the recipients tend to undergo more procedures, depending on the number of donated cryo-embryos. Twentyeight<br />women received embryos from known donors, with a clinical pregnancy rate per embryo transfer of 24%, and<br />live birth rate of 14%. In total, 82 recipients were granted donated cryo-embryos, twenty had an ongoing pregnancy<br />(24.4%), nineteen of whom have given birth to a healthy child (23%).<br />Conclusion: Altruistic embryo donation of embryos appears to be satisfying for the donors, as they are not obliged to destroy<br />their embryos, but instead help others build a family. Although success rates are still limited, partly due to the relatively high<br />miscarriage rates and inferior freezing techniques, to this date nineteen out of 82 recipients have given birth to a healthy child.",

        "abstract": "Almost 50% of the infertility cases are due to male factors. Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) allow to overcome the incapacity of these patients' spermatozoa to fertilize the oocyte and produce a viable and healthy offspring, but the efficiency of the different techniques has still the potential to improve. According to the latest reports of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC), the percentages of deliveries per ART cycle in 2014 and 2016 were 21 and 22%, respectively. Among the reasons for this relatively low efficiency, the quality of the spermatozoa has been pointed out as critical, and the presence of high percentages of DNA-damaged spermatozoa in patients' ejaculates is possibly one of the main factors reducing the ARTs outcomes. Thus, one of the main challenges in reproductive medicine is to ensure the highest quality of the spermatozoa used in ARTs, and specifically, in terms of genetic integrity. The latest techniques for the preparation and selection of human spermatozoa are herein discussed focusing on those proven to improve one or several of the following parameters: sperm genetic integrity, fertilization capacity, embryo production, and ",

Children are thus deprived of treatment based on the same quality of information that guides treatment in adults. The knowledge gap regarding efficacy and safety of medicines in children has been acknowledged by authorities and is reflected in legislation both in North America and in the European Union. Recent reports on the effects of legislation indicates that paediatric clinical trials remain a challenge.Paediatric clinical trials are needed in the entire developmental age spectrum and are especially needed in certain therapy areas. Paediatric clinical trials have special features compared with trials in adults, and these need to be taken into account. These special features include scientific issues related to small samples and heterogeneity, the consent/assent procedure, the need for age-appropriate study information, specific outcomes and safety issues related to development and maturation. Competence in paediatric clinical trials is required in both designing, planning, co-ordinating and organising paediatric clinical trials, as well as research infrastructure and networks to increase power and disseminate information and expert advice. Strengthening of paediatric clinical research is essential to facilitate generating the data that will let children enjoy new medical advances in a similar manner as adults.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is unmet need for male contraceptive options, but a recent injectable combination male contraceptive trial was terminated early due to adverse events (AEs). METHODS: We examined the frequency of reported AEs by male research participants compared with AEs reported in prescribing information of approved female hormonal contraceptive methods. Published data from trials of the top five most-used female hormonal contraceptives, supplemented by contemporary contraceptive research, were compared with the frequency of AEs reported in a male injectable hormonal contraceptive trial. RESULTS: We observed similar frequencies of AEs reported by users of male contraceptives compared with those reported by female users. Among quantitatively comparable AEs, compared with men, women reported experiencing higher frequencies of headaches, pelvic pain, and weight gain and similar frequencies of decreased libido. Compared with women, men reported experiencing higher frequencies of acne and mood changes. Men discontinued participation due to AEs at a lower frequency than women. CONCLUSIONS: Female hormonal methods generally have similar frequencies of AEs to those reported in a recent male hormonal contraceptive trial, and male users had lower rates of discontinuation due to AEs. There were fewer serious AEs of the male contraceptive than reported in contemporary female trials which resulted in FDA licensure. This suggests there may be implicit bias in the scientific community regarding the level of acceptable risk for users of male contraceptive methods.",

Yet we lack data in medical students who are at risk of addictive behavior. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of cannabis consumption and cannabis use disorder (CUD) among French medical students and their association with psychotropic drug consumption and psychosocial factors. Medical students were recruited from 35 French universities of medicine through administration mailing lists and social networks, between December 2016 and May 2017. Cannabis consumption was self-declared by anonymous questionnaire and CUD was defined by a Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) score\u2009\u2265\u20093. 10,985 medical students with a mean age of 21.8\u00a0years (\u00b1\u20093.3) were included, 32% of which were men. Overall, 1642 [14.9 (14.3; 15.6)%] reported cannabis consumption and 622 [5.7 (5.2; 6.1)%] students were identified with CUD at screening. Men were at two-time higher risk of cannabis consumption and three-time higher risk of CUD (22.4% and 10.6% for men vs. 11.5% and 3.4%, respectively, for women). In multivariate analyses, men sex, alcohol use disorder, tobacco smoking, parents' divorce, and history of physical assault and lower rates of lower rates of\u2009\u2265\u200940 weekly worked hours were identified as common associated factors for cannabis consumption and CUD. Hypnotic consumption, psychiatric follow-up, and history of sexual assault were identified as factors associated specifically with CUD, suggesting that these factors were associated with more severe cannabis consumption. Only 17% of students identified with CUD reported a psychiatric follow-up. Altogether, these results suggest that health policies should target cannabis consumption in medical students that is frequent, especially in men, with low rates of psychiatric follow-up. We have identified psychological factors and increased hypnotic drug consumption in CUD participants suggesting that psychiatric follow-up should be systematically proposed to this group.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adolescence is crucial period for laying the foundations for healthy development and mental well-being. The increasing prevalence of mental disorders amongst adolescents makes promotion of mental well-being and prevention interventions at schools important. UPRIGHT (Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally implemented in schools to improve and promote mental Health for Teenagers) is designed as a whole school approach (school community, students and families) to promote a culture of mental well-being and prevent mental disorders by enhancing resilience capacities. The present article aims at describing the rationale, conceptual framework, as well as methodology of implementation and evaluation of the UPRIGHT intervention. METHODS: UPRIGHT project is a research and innovation project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement No. 754919 (Duration: 48\u2009months). The theoretical framework has been developed by an innovative and multidisciplinary approach using a co-creation process inside the UPRIGHT Consortium (involving seven institutions from Spain, Italy, Poland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland). Resulted is the UPRIGHT programme with 18 skills related to 4 components: Mindfulness, Coping, Efficacy and Social and Emotional Learning. Among the five Pan-European regions, 34 schools have been currently involved (17 control; 17 intervention) and around 6000 adolescents and their families are foreseen to participate along a 3-year period of evaluation. Effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated as a randomized controlled trial including quantitative and qualitative analysis in the five Pan-European regions representative of the cultural and socioeconomic diversity. The cost-effectiveness assessment will be performed by simulation modelling methods. DISCUSSION: We expect a short- to medium-term improvement of mental well-being in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities. The study may provide robust evidence on intrapersonal, familiar and social environmental resilience factors promoting positive mental well-being.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Infertility affects 15-17% of reproductive age couples in our country, and 10-15% of couples worldwide. The aim of this paper was to present results and experience gained after the first 1000 cycles of the national In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) program, to offer professional standard of work in our country and to compare it with results obtained in Europe and worldwide. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study prospectively included 1000 women who had undergone national In Vitro Fertilization program from October 2006 until November 2009 at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Clinical Center of Vojvodina, Novi Sad. RESULTS: The analysis included 1000 in vitro fertilization cycles. Male factor infertility was the leading cause (56.9%) followed by tubal factor (45.9%). The classic method of in vitro fertilization constituted 72.3% of all cycles, while intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) method was used in 27.7% of all cycles. The average number of embryos transferred was 2.67. The cycle cancellation rate was 14.10% and the aspiration rate was 94.40%. The clinical pregnancy and live birth rate were 33.41% and 26.78% per embryo transfer respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results in our study showed that in our setting there are far less intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles compared with the European average of 66.5% of all fresh cycles, and that we transferred more embryos on average. Our success rates are comparable with those in other European countries where the clinical pregnancy rates per aspiration and per transfer for in vitro fertilization were 29 and 32.4%, respectively in the period of observation. For intracytoplasmic sperm injection, the corresponding rates were 29.9 and 33%.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method. The model has better diagnostic performance compared with conventional inflammatory indicators such as CRP, Hb, NEU%, and PCT.",

Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2\u03bcg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population. Taken together, we concluded that the IL-17 signaling pathway serves as a significant potential mechanism of sepsis and provides a promising therapeutic target for sepsis treatment. This research will further deepen our understanding of sepsis development.",

Epidemiological data about sepsis from the 2017 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factor Study showed that the global burden of sepsis was greater than previously estimated. Bacteria have been shown to be the predominant pathogen of sepsis among patients with pathogens detected, while sepsis caused by viruses is underdiagnosed worldwide. The coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 in China and now in many other countries has brought viral sepsis back into the vision of physicians and researchers worldwide. Although the current understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis has improved, the differences between viral and bacterial sepsis at the level of pathophysiology are not well understood. Diagnosis methods that can broadly differentiate between bacterial and viral sepsis at the initial stage after the development of sepsis are limited. New treatments that can be applied at clinics for sepsis are scarce and this situation is not consistent with the growing understanding of pathophysiology.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Diagnosing neonatal sepsis is heavily dependent on clinical phenotyping as culture-positive body fluid has poor sensitivity, and existing blood biomarkers have poor specificity.A combination of machine learning, statistical and deep pathway biology analyses led to the identification of a tripartite panel of biologically connected immune and metabolic markers that showed greater than 99% accuracy for detecting bacterial infection with 100% sensitivity. The cohort study described here is designed as a large-scale clinical validation of this previous work. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre observational study will prospectively recruit a total of 1445 newborn infants (all gestations)-1084 with suspected early-or late-onset sepsis, and 361 controls-over 4\u2009years. A small volume of whole blood will be collected from infants with suspected sepsis at the time of presentation. This sample will be used for integrated transcriptomic, lipidomic and targeted proteomics profiling. In addition, a subset of samples will be subjected to cellular phenotype and proteomic analyses. A second sample from the same patient will be collected at 24 hours, with an opportunistic sampling for stool culture. For control infants, only one set of blood and stool sample will be collected to coincide with clinical blood sampling. Along with detailed clinical information, blood and stool samples will be analysed and the information will be used to identify and validate the efficacy of immune-metabolic networks in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal sepsis and to identify new host biomarkers for viral sepsis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received research ethics committee approval from the Wales Research Ethics Committee 2 (reference 19/WA/0008) and operational approval from Health and Care Research Wales. Submission of study results for publication will involve making available all anonymised primary and processed data on public repository sites. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03777670.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide expression profiles have been previously employed as clinical research diagnostic tools for newborn sepsis. We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

Fifteen articles were assessed for eligibility. Four studies were included, with totally 78 neonates. The studies used different diagnostic criteria and had between 1 and 16 sepsis cases. All studies with bacterial sepsis found alterations in the glucose and lactate metabolism, reflecting possible redistribution of glucose consumption from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to the lactate and pentose phosphate pathway. We also found signs of increased oxidative stress and fatty acid oxidation in sepsis cases. CONCLUSION: We found signs of metabolomic signatures in neonatal sepsis. This may lead to better understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and detection of new candidate biomarkers. Results should be validated in large-scale multicentre studies.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can be caused by a broad range of pathogens; however, bacterial infections represent the majority of sepsis cases. Up to 42% of sepsis presentations are culture negative, suggesting a non-bacterial cause. Despite this, diagnosis of viral sepsis remains very rare. Almost any virus can cause sepsis in vulnerable patients (e.g., neonates, infants, and other immunosuppressed groups). The prevalence of viral sepsis is not known, nor is there enough information to make an accurate estimate. The initial standard of care for all cases of sepsis, even those that are subsequently proven to be culture negative, is the immediate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the absence of definite diagnostic criteria for viral sepsis, or at least to exclude bacterial sepsis, this inevitably leads to unnecessary antimicrobial use, with associated consequences for antimicrobial resistance, effects on the host microbiome and excess healthcare costs. It is important to understand non-bacterial causes of sepsis so that inappropriate treatment can be minimised, and appropriate treatments can be developed to improve outcomes. In this review, we summarise what is known about viral sepsis, its most common causes, and how the immune responses to severe viral infections can contribute to sepsis. We also discuss strategies to improve our understanding of viral sepsis, and ways we can integrate this new information into effective treatment.",

        "abstract": "It has been ten years since the identification of NTCP as the cell surface receptor for HBV and HDV entry into hepatocytes. The search for molecules interfering with the binding of NTCP and HBV/HDV led to design bulevirtide (BLV). This large polypeptide mimics a region of the pre-S1 HBsAg and blocks viral entry by inhibitory competition. BLV was initially tested in cell cultures, animal models and more recently in Phase I-III human trials (called 'MYRS'). As monotherapy or in combination with peginterferon, BLV is well tolerated and exhibits potent antiviral activity. Plasma viremia significantly declines and/or becomes undetectable in more than 75% of patients treated for >24 weeks. However, serum HBsAg concentrations remain unchanged. No selection of BLV resistance in HBV/HDV has been reported in vivo to date. BLV is administered subcutaneously once daily at doses between 2 and 10 mg. BLV received conditional approval in Europe in 2020 to treat chronic hepatitis delta. The advent of peginterferon lambda or new specific anti-HDV antivirals (lonafarnib, etc.) will open the door for combination therapies with BLV. Since there is no stable reservoir for HDV-RNA within infected hepatocytes, viral clearance might be achieved using antivirals for a minimum timeframe. This is what happens in hepatitis C combining several antivirals, curing nearly all patients treated for 3 months. Clearance of HDV-RNA genomes may occur despite HBV persistence as cccDNA or chromosome integrated HBV-DNA within hepatocytes. This is supported by cases of HDV elimination using BLV despite persistence of serum HBsAg. Another path for HDV cure will derive from achieving HBsAg clearance, the goal of new promising anti-HBV gene therapies (bepirovirsen, etc.). In summary, the advent of BLV has triggered a renovated interest for antiviral therapy in hepatitis delta. We envision combination therapies that will lead to HDV cure in the near future.",

Bepirovirsen at all dose levels was rapidly absorbed (maximum plasma concentration 3-8 hours after dosing), rapidly distributed to peripheral tissues, and slowly eliminated (median plasma terminal half-life: 22.5-24.6 days across cohorts). Plasma exposure (dose-proportional at 150-450 mg) and concentration-time profiles were similar following the first and sixth doses, suggesting little to no plasma accumulation (steady state achieved by day 22). Renal elimination of full-length bepirovirsen accounted for <2% of the total dose. Across the single and multiple dose cohorts, 197 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported, with 99% and 65% classified as mild in severity and local injection site reactions, respectively. In conclusion, bepirovirsen showed an acceptable safety profile in humans with observed pharmacokinetics consistent with the chemical class, warranting further evaluation of bepirovirsen in chronic HBV infection.",

        "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare disability causing female-oriented pediatric neurodevelopmental unmet medical need. RTT was recognized in 1966. However, over the past 56 years, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has authorized no effective treatment for RTT. Recently, Trofinetide was approved by the USFDA on 10 March 2023 as the first RTT treatment. This article underlines the pharmaceutical advancement, patent literature, and prospects of Trofinetide. The data for this study were gathered from the PubMed database, authentic websites (Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Neuren Pharmaceuticals, and USFDA), and free patent databases. Trofinetide was first disclosed by Neuren Pharmaceuticals in 2000 as a methyl group containing analog of the naturally occurring neuroprotective tripeptide called glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE). The joint efforts of Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Neuren Pharmaceuticals have developed Trofinetide. The mechanism of action of Trofinetide is not yet well established. However, it is supposed to improve neuronal morphology and synaptic functioning. The patent literature revealed a handful of inventions related to Trofinetide, providing excellent and unexplored broad research possibilities with Trofinetide. The development of innovative Trofinetide-based molecules, combinations of Trofinetide, patient-compliant drug formulations, and precise MECP2-mutation-related personalized medicines are foreseeable. Trofinetide is in clinical trials for some neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including treating Fragile X syndrome (FXS). It is expected that Trofinetide may be approved for treating FXS in the future. The USFDA-approval of Trofinetide is one of the important milestones for RTT therapy and is the beginning of a new era for the therapy of RTT, FXS, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), brain injury, stroke, and other NDDs.",

        "abstract": "We reviewed recent major clinical trials with investigational drugs for the treatment of subjects with neurodegenerative diseases caused by inheritance of gene mutations or associated with genetic risk factors. Specifically, we discussed randomized clinical trials in subjects with Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis bearing pathogenic gene mutations, and glucocerebrosidase-associated Parkinson's disease. Learning potential lessons to improve future therapeutic approaches is the aim of this review. Two long-term, controlled trials on three anti-\u03b2-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab and crenezumab) in subjects carrying Alzheimer's disease-linked mutated genes encoding for amyloid precursor protein or presenilin 1 or presenilin 2 failed to show cognitive or functional benefits. A major trial on tominersen, an antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce the production of the huntingtin protein in subjects with Huntington's disease, was prematurely interrupted because the drug failed to show higher efficacy than placebo and, at highest doses, led to worsened outcomes. A 28-week trial of tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide for superoxide dismutase 1 in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with superoxide dismutase 1 gene mutations failed to show significant beneficial effects but the 1-year open label extension of this study indicated better clinical and functional outcomes in the group with early tofersen therapy. A trial of venglustat, a potent and brain-penetrant glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, in Parkinson's disease subjects with heterozygous glucocerebrosidase gene mutations revealed worsened clinical and cognitive performance of patients on the enzyme inhibitor compared to placebo. We concluded that clinical trials in neurodegenerative diseases with a genetic basis should test monoclonal antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides or gene editing directed against the mutated enzyme or the mutated substrate without dramatically affecting physiological wild-type variants.",

This dose-finding study was the first to assess GSK3389404 for chronic HBV infection. METHODS: This phase IIa, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-part study was conducted in 22 centres in Asia (NCT03020745). Pharmacokinetic findings from Part 1 informed Part 2 dosing. In Part 2, patients with chronic hepatitis B on nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy were randomised 11:2 to GSK3389404 (30, 60, 120\u00a0mg weekly or 120\u00a0mg bi-weekly) or placebo until Day 85. Coprimary endpoints included HBsAg response (\u22651.5 log RESULTS: Parts 1 and 2 included 12 (9 GSK3389404, 3 placebo) and 66 patients (56 GSK3389404, 10 placebo), respectively. In Part 2, one patient each in the 60\u00a0mg weekly, 120\u00a0mg weekly and 120\u00a0mg bi-weekly arms achieved a HBsAg response. HBsAg reductions were dose-dependent (Day 85: mean 0.34 [60\u00a0mg weekly] to 0.75 log CONCLUSIONS: GSK3389404 showed an acceptable safety profile and target engagement, with dose-dependent reductions in HBsAg. However, no efficacious dosing regimen was identified. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT03020745. LAY SUMMARY: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can result in chronic HBV infection, which may ultimately lead to chronic liver disease, primary liver cancer and death; HBV proteins may prevent the immune system from successfully controlling the virus. GSK3389404 is an investigational agent that targets HBV RNA, resulting in reduced viral protein production. This study assessed the safety of GSK3389404 and its ability to reduce the viral proteins in patients with chronic HBV infection. GSK3389404 showed dose-dependent reduction in hepatitis B surface antigen, with an acceptable safety profile. While no clear optimal dose was identified, the findings from this study may help in the development of improved treatment options for patients with chronic HBV infections.",

        "title": "Early detection of late-onset neonatal sepsis from noninvasive biosignals using deep learning: A multicenter prospective development and validation study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its accurate and timely diagnosis is hindered by vague symptoms and the urgent necessity for early antibiotic intervention. The gold standard for diagnosing the condition is the identification of a pathogenic organism from normally sterile sites via laboratory testing. However, this method is resource-intensive and cannot be conducted continuously. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to predict the onset of late-onset sepsis (LOS) with good diagnostic value as early as possible using non-invasive biosignal measurements from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) monitors. METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study, we developed a multimodal machine learning algorithm based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure that uses the power spectral density (PSD) of recorded biosignals to predict the onset of LOS. This approach aimed to discern LOS-related pathogenic spectral signatures without labor-intensive manual artifact removal. RESULTS: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic score of 0.810 (95\u00a0% CI 0.698-0.922) on the validation dataset. With an optimal operating point, LOS detection had 83\u00a0% sensitivity and 73\u00a0% specificity. The median early detection was 44\u00a0h before clinical suspicion. The results highlighted the additive importance of electrocardiogram and respiratory impedance (RESP) signals in improving predictive accuracy. According to a more detailed analysis, the predictive power arose from the morphology of the electrocardiogram's R-wave and sudden changes in the RESP signal. CONCLUSION: Raw biosignals from NICU monitors, in conjunction with PSD transformation, as input to the CNN, can provide state-of-the-art prediction performance for LOS without the need for artifact removal. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to highlight the independent and additive predictive potential of electrocardiogram R-wave morphology and concurrent, sudden changes in the RESP waveform in predicting the onset of LOS using non-invasive biosignals.",

        "abstract": "Myostatin is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth secreted by skeletal myocytes. In the past years, myostatin inhibition sparked interest among the scientific community for its potential to enhance muscle growth and to reduce, or even prevent, muscle atrophy. These characteristics make it a promising target for the treatment of muscle atrophy in motor neuron diseases, namely, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which are rare neurological diseases, whereby the degeneration of motor neurons leads to progressive muscle loss and paralysis. These diseases carry a huge burden of morbidity and mortality but, despite this unfavorable scenario, several therapeutic advancements have been made in the past years. Indeed, a number of different curative therapies for SMA have been approved, leading to a revolution in the life expectancy and outcomes of SMA patients. Similarly, tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, is now undergoing clinical trial phase for use in ALS patients carrying the SOD1 mutation. However, these therapies are not able to completely halt or reverse progression of muscle damage. Recently, a trial evaluating apitegromab, a myostatin inhibitor, in SMA patients was started, following positive results from preclinical studies. In this context, myostatin inhibition could represent a useful strategy to tackle motor symptoms in these patients. The aim of this review is to describe the myostatin pathway and its role in motor neuron diseases, and to summarize and critically discuss preclinical and clinical studies of myostatin inhibitors in SMA and ALS. Then, we will highlight promises and pitfalls related to the use of myostatin inhibitors in the human setting, to aid the scientific community in the development of future clinical trials.",

However, an excess or deficiency of iron is related to certain pathologies. The maintenance of iron homeostasis is essential to avoid certain pathologies related to iron excess or deficiency. The existence of iron deposits in postmortem tissues of Parkinson's patients has been interpreted as evidence that iron plays a fundamental role in the degenerative process of the nigrostriatal system in this disease. The use of iron chelators has been successful in the treatment of diseases such as transfusion-dependent thalassemia and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. However, a clinical study with the iron chelator deferiprone in patients with Parkinson's disease has not shown positive effects but rather worsened clinical symptoms. This suggests that iron may not play a role in the degenerative process of Parkinson's disease.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population. Taken together, we concluded that the IL-17 signaling pathway serves as a significant potential mechanism of sepsis and provides a promising therapeutic target for sepsis treatment.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AIMS: The targeting of solid cancers with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells faces many technological hurdles, including selection of optimal target antigens. Promising pre-clinical and clinical data of CAR T-cell activity have emerged from targeting surface antigens such as GD2 and B7H3 in childhood cancer neuroblastoma. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is expressed in a majority of neuroblastomas at low antigen density but is largely absent from healthy tissues. METHODS: To explore an alternate target antigen for neuroblastoma CAR T-cell therapy, the authors generated and screened a single-chain variable fragment library targeting ALK extracellular domain to make a panel of new anti-ALK CAR T-cell constructs. RESULTS: A lead novel CAR T-cell construct was capable of specific cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma cells expressing low levels of ALK, but with only weak cytokine and proliferative T-cell responses. To explore strategies for amplifying ALK CAR T cells, the authors generated a co-CAR approach in which T cells received signal 1 from a first-generation ALK construct and signal 2 from anti-B7H3 or GD2 chimeric co-stimulatory receptors. The co-CAR approach successfully demonstrated the ability to avoid targeting single-antigen-positive targets as a strategy for mitigating on-target off-tumor toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further proof of concept for ALK as a neuroblastoma CAR T-cell target.",

METHODS: We selected the TMEM family genes through the Human Protein Atlas and characterized their expression by single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. Identification of the key TMEM genes was performed through three machine learning algorithms: LASSO, SVM-RFE and RF-SRC. Then, we established TMEM gene riskscore and estimate its implication in predicting survival and response to systematic therapy. Additionally, we explored the difference and impact of TMEM gene expression in PDAC through immunohistochemistry and cell line research. RESULTS: 5 key TMEM genes (ANO1, TMEM59, TMEM204, TMEM205, TMEM92) were selected based on the single-cell analysis and machine learning survival outcomes. Patients stratified into the high and low-risk groups based on TMEM riskscore, were observed with distinct overall survival in internal and external datasets. Moreover, through bulk RNA-sequence and immunohistochemical staining we verified the protein expression of TMEM genes in PDAC and revealed TMEM92 as an essential regulator of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSION: Our study on TMEM gene expression and behavior in PDAC has revealed unique characteristics, offering potential for precise therapeutic approaches.

Research suggests gender affirmation surgery has been established as an effective and medically indicated treatment for gender dysphoria. Although most data on gender-affirming surgeries are from adult populations, there is growing literature establishing their effectiveness in adolescents and young adults. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the perioperative outcomes for gender-diverse youth to deliver safe and affirming care. The primary objective of this retrospective case series is to examine the perioperative characteristics and outcomes of patients with gender identity disorders (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10-code F64) who underwent chest reconstruction (mastectomy) and genital surgery (phalloplasty, metoidioplasty, and vaginoplasty) in a pediatric academic hospital. The secondary aim is to evaluate the value of a specialized anesthesia team for improving clinical outcomes, interdisciplinary communication, and further advancing the transgender perioperative experience. We identified 204 gender affirmation surgical cases, 177 chests/top surgeries, and 27 genital/bottom surgeries. These findings indicate gender-diverse individuals who underwent life-changing surgery at our institution had a median age of 18 years old, with many patients identifying as transmen. Our data suggests that postoperative pain was significant, but adverse events were minimal.

Sepsis organ dysfunction scores-pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) (Schlapbach, Matics, Shime), quickSOFA, quickSOFA-L, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD)-2, quickPELOD-2, and Pediatric Multiple Organ Dysfunction score-were calculated during the first 24 hours of admission (day 1) and their performance compared with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and severe sepsis-International Consensus Conference on Pediatric Sepsis(ICCPS)-derived criteria-using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Primary outcome was PICU mortality. Secondary outcomes were: a composite of death and new disability (ie, change from baseline Pediatric Overall Performance Category score \u22651); prolonged PICU length of stay (>5 d); prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) (>3 d). RESULTS: Among 60 patients with sepsis, 4 (6.7%) died, 7 (11.7%) developed new disability, 26 (43.3%) experienced prolonged length of stay, and 21 (35%) prolonged invasive MV. The prognostic ability in mortality discrimination was significantly higher for organ dysfunction scores, with PELOD-2 showing the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.924; 95% confidence interval, 0.837-1.000), significantly better than SIRS 3 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P = 0.009), SIRS 4 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P < 0.001), and severe sepsis (0.924 vs 0.527, P < 0.001). Among secondary outcomes, PELOD-2 performed significantly better than SIRS criteria and severe sepsis to predict prolonged duration of invasive MV, whereas better than severe sepsis to predict \"poor outcome\" (mortality or new disability). CONCLUSIONS: Day 1 organ dysfunction scores performed better in predicting mortality and morbidity outcomes than ICCPS-derived criteria. The PELOD-2 was the organ dysfunction score with the best performance for all outcomes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Geniospasm is a rare and generally benign movement disorder of the chin yet with potentially debilitating complications. Due to its rarity, previous literature was limited to only case reports or series with critical knowledge gap on its natural history, prognosis, and management. We aimed to establish the natural history, prognosis, and treatment for geniospasm. METHODS: A systematic review on case reports or series was performed with literature search on PubMed and Google Scholar, from inception through December 2021. The quality of the reports was assessed with low-quality articles excluded for analyses other than demographics. RESULTS: Forty-one articles were included for demographic analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a0489) while forty articles for other analyses (n\u00a0=\u00a0451). There was only slight male preponderance of this disease in our cohort (Male:Female\u00a0=\u00a01.2:1) with 98.6% having family history of geniospasm, 68.1% having onset below 1\u00a0year of age, 91.4% having emotional triggers of the symptoms, 25.7% having geniospasm in sleep, 100% involving mentalis muscles, 4.9% involving muscles adjacent to mentalis, 55.2% having regular paroxysms (\u22651/week, but brief in 56.3% of the cases) and only 11.1% having complications. The paroxysms reduced with age, but complete remission only happened in 9.9%. Females (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010) and those without geniospasm in sleep (p\u00a0=\u00a00.048) were associated with good outcome of the disease. Geniospasm was usually refractory to treatment except for regular botulinum toxin injections. CONCLUSION: Generally, geniospasm improved with age but complete remission was rare. Considering our review limitations, our findings should be interpreted with caution. Future studies of higher evidence level are crucial.",

        "title": "Phoenix criteria for sepsis: are these enough to guide a clinician?",
        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. There is a paucity of data on the criteria used to define sepsis and septic shock and predict mortality. Schlapbach et al. published Phoenix criteria to define sepsis in JAMA in 2024. Previously, paediatricians have used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, but these criteria lack sensitivity and specificity. This group recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Though included in the 8-point criteria, important criteria like renal and liver are missing from the main criteria. We remain worried about the way these criteria got excluded from the main criteria. Therefore, in this brief report, whilst commending the authors for this stelar task, we highlight the main pitfalls in these criteria especially the renal, neurologic, and liver criteria. These criteria have been shown to be independently associated with outcomes, and we recommend that in the future iterations of the criteria, renal and liver criteria should be defined according to latest definitions and the task force consider utilizing latest criteria for each organ system involved within the formulated criteria. CONCLUSION: \u00a0In conclusion, Phoenix criteria are a step in the right direction to define life-threatening organ dysfunction in sepsis, but clinicians need to be mindful that diagnosis/treatment of less severe sepsis should not be delayed if these criteria are not met. Therefore, local early detection and management tools for sepsis should be followed. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 There has always been a quest for a definition for pediatric sepsis. There are limitations to the previous pediatric sepsis criteria which were published in 2005 by the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC). IPSCC defines sepsis as a suspected or confirmed infection in the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). These new Phoenix Pediatric Sepsis (PPS) criteria for sepsis and septic shock are intended to identify children with life-threatening organ dysfunction due to infection, and the score was developed based on a very large pediatric dataset. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022 Though the intention of Phoenix criteria is to help identify children with life threatening organ dysfunction, unfortunately the crietria will miss signs of early sepis. In this manuscript, we point out some of the drawbacks of these criteria which need to be borne in mind while applying these criteria.",

        "abstract": "It has been ten years since the identification of NTCP as the cell surface receptor for HBV and HDV entry into hepatocytes. The search for molecules interfering with the binding of NTCP and HBV/HDV led to design bulevirtide (BLV). This large polypeptide mimics a region of the pre-S1 HBsAg and blocks viral entry by inhibitory competition. BLV was initially tested in cell cultures, animal models and more recently in Phase I-III human trials (called 'MYRS'). As monotherapy or in combination with peginterferon, BLV is well tolerated and exhibits potent antiviral activity. Plasma viremia significantly declines and/or becomes undetectable in more than 75% of patients treated for >24 weeks. However, serum HBsAg concentrations remain unchanged. No selection of BLV resistance in HBV/HDV has been reported in vivo to date. BLV is administered subcutaneously once daily at doses between 2 and 10 mg. BLV received conditional approval in Europe in 2020 to treat chronic hepatitis delta. The advent of peginterferon lambda or new specific anti-HDV antivirals (lonafarnib, etc.) will open the door for combination therapies with BLV. Since there is no stable reservoir for HDV-RNA within infected hepatocytes, viral clearance might be achieved using antivirals for a minimum timeframe. This is what happens in hepatitis C combining several antivirals, curing nearly all patients treated for 3 months. Clearance of HDV-RNA genomes may occur despite HBV persistence as cccDNA or chromosome integrated HBV-DNA within hepatocytes. This is supported by cases of HDV elimination using BLV despite persistence of serum HBsAg. Another path for HDV cure will derive from achieving HBsAg clearance, the goal of new promising anti-HBV gene therapies (bepirovirsen, etc.). In summary, the advent of BLV has triggered a renovated interest for antiviral therapy in hepatitis delta. We envision combination therapies that will lead to HDV cure in the near future.",

We categorized the reported 53 unique outcome instruments and additional descriptive measures into 10 categories and 12 sub-categories. Movement and Posture was the most frequently reported outcome category, followed by Safety, however Quality of Life, and various prevalent comorbidities and complications of CP were infrequently reported.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS.

Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended.

        "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: What is the sensitivity and the specificity of preoperative transvaginal ultrasound with bowel preparation (TVUS-BP) compared to diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) for the identification of ovarian and deep sites of endometriosis? SUMMARY ANSWER: DL was able to detect retrocervical, ovarian, and bladder endometriosis with similar sensitivity and specificity as TVUS-BP, whereas for vaginal and rectosigmoid endometriosis, DL had lower sensitivity and specificity than TVUS-BP. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: TVUS-BP is a non-invasive examination with good accuracy for diagnosing ovarian and deep endometriosis. DL is expensive and can lead to surgical complications. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This prospective study included a total of 120 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for suspected endometriosis with preoperative imaging (TVUS-BP), including a video of the laparoscopic procedure, between March 2017 and September 2019. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Two radiologists performed preoperative TVUS-BP using the same protocol for diagnosing endometriosis. Two surgeons, who were blinded to the results of the preoperative imaging and clinical data, reviewed the surgical videos from the entry of the abdominal cavity until the surgeon finalized a complete and systematic review prior to beginning any dissection (considered as a DL). A data sheet was used by surgeons and radiologists to record the sites and size of disease involvement, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) stage, and the Enzian score. The surgical visualization of endometriosis lesions that were confirmed by histological analysis was the gold standard. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: DL was able to detect retrocervical, ovarian, and bladder endometriosis with similar sensitivity and specificity as TVUS-BP. DL was not able to detect vaginal endometriosis (sensitivity and specificity 0%): this is compared to a sensitivity and specificity of 85.7% and 99.1%, respectively with the utilization of a preoperative TVUS-BP. In addition, DL was notably poor at detecting rectosigmoid endometriosis, with a sensitivity of 3.7-5.6%, and this compares to 96.3% sensitivity with utilization of a preoperative TVUS (P\u2009<\u20090.001). For the ASRM stage, TVUS-BP results were highly correlated with the degree of endometriosis and pouch of Douglas (POD) obliteration (weighted Kappa of 0.867 and 0.985, respectively). For the Enzian score, there was a substantial correlation between TVUSP-BP and DL for compartment A (weighted Kappa = 0.827), compartment B (weighted Kappa\u2009=\u20090.670), and compartment C (weighted kappa = 0.814). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The number of participants included may be a limitation in this study and, as the evaluators were blinded to the physical exam, the DL accuracy could be underestimated. As biopsies of pelvic organs were obtained only if there was a suspicion of endometriosis, the gold standard was not always applicable. This aspect could underestimate the prevalence of lesions and overestimate the sensitivity and the specificity of both the TVUS-BP and the DL. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Preoperative TVUS-BP was accurate in identifying all sites of ovarian and deep endometriosis that were evaluated. It had significantly higher sensitivity than DL in detecting rectosigmoid endometriosis and predicting intraoperative ASRM staging and the Enzian score. These results suggest that TVUS-BP can replace DL for the diagnosis and treatment planning for patients with ovarian and deep endometriosis.

        "title": "Early diagnosis of the learning disabilities in kids using a computer game-based solution.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Learning disabilities or learning disorders are umbrella terms used for wide variety of learning problems like Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dysgraphia, and Dyspraxia. These disabilities are due to the neurological disorders which affects brain functions. Early diagnosis of these disabilities in kids from age 3 to 6 will help to start early medical treatments and get them back to the normal condition. MATERIAL AND METHOD: we developed a software-based Learning Disability Evaluation Kit called YALU with computer Game Modules for kids targeting their learning disabilities. These Computer game-based modules of the YALU consist of different tasks for the different age levels to identify the symptoms of the disabilities mentioned above. The children's interaction results to each task of the game modules with the answers of the questioner about the children given by the parents will be evaluated with the threshold values given by a panel of consultant psychologist and paediatrician of the normal kids to identify the learning disabilities in kids aged 3-6\u2009years. The result will be given to the respective parties and uploaded to the Website under the child's name. RESULT: YALU has been tested using 50 students in age 3-5 in three preschools. The teachers have identified Fourteen students with some learning disability symptoms. Using YALU, twelve out of fourteen students had been clearly identified. Hence, the YALU Evaluation Kit to have an accuracy 85% in diagnosing the right disability. However, the accuracy could be increased with the accurate assessments of the parents about their kids.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONLearning disabilities are neurological disorders that affect the brain's ability to receive, process, store, respond to and communicate information; and there are four types (Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Dysgraphia and Dyscalculia)In this paper, we present the extracted computational techniques targeting the Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Dysgraphia and Dyscalculia and developed a software application (YALU Learning Disability Evaluation Kit) which consists of computer game modules for the kids for evaluation their learning disabilities.The developed game modules can screen the learning disabilities and these gamification modules (YALU) consists of tasks which are based on symptoms of the said disabilities. The outcomes of each module is evaluated these learning disabilities in kids age from 3 years to 6 years by analysing children's interactions to the each tasks, the child condition and then compare the result with the threshold values of the normal kids given by consultant psychologist and paediatrician.",

        "title": "Socio-demographic profile and clinical co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary care hospital in India: A retrospective case record study.",
        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cannabis use has been the most commonly used illicit psychoactive substance in India. Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.",

        "abstract": "The increasing consumption of rare earth elements (REEs) has resulted in a considerable risk of environmental exposure. However, the adverse effects of prenatal REEs exposure on children's neurodevelopment are not yet fully recognized. Therefore, we investigated the individual and joint effects of prenatal exposure to 13 REEs on children's neurocognitive development based on 809 mother-child pairs from a large birth cohort in Wuhan, China. Maternal urinary concentrations of 13 REEs were repeatedly measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Children's neurodevelopment [e.g., mental and psychomotor development index (MDI/PDI)] at 24-months was assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development of Chinese Revision. GEE and BKMR models were applied to estimate the individual and joint effects of prenatal REE exposure on child neurodevelopment level. After controlling for typical confounders, we observed that exposure to 9 REEs during the first trimester were significantly associated with decreased MDI scores [\u03b2s and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) ranging from -2.24 (-3.86\u00a0\u223c\u00a0-0.63) to -1.44 (-2.26\u223c -0.26)], and 7 REEs during third trimester were significantly associated decreased PDI scores [\u03b2 and 95% CIs ranging from -1.95 (-3.19\u00a0\u223c\u00a0-0.71) to -1.25 (-2.34\u00a0\u223c\u00a0-0.16)]. Higher quantiles of REE mixture in first and third trimester were associated with decreased MDI and PDI score. Thulium, erbium in the first trimester and cerium, lanthanum in the third trimester accounted most importance to joint effects on MDI and PDI, respectively. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to higher concentrations of REEs during the first and third trimester were negative associated with children's neurodevelopment.",

        "title": "Metabolic biomarkers of neonatal sepsis: identification using metabolomics combined with machine learning.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a common disease associated with neonatal and infant mortality, and for diagnosis, blood culture is currently the gold standard method, but it has a low positivity rate and requires more than 2\u00a0days to develop. Meanwhile, unfortunately, the specific biomarkers for the early and timely diagnosis of sepsis in infants and for the determination of the severity of this disease are lacking in clinical practice. METHODS: Samples from 18 sepsis infants with comorbidities, 25 sepsis infants without comorbidities, and 25 infants with noninfectious diseases were evaluated using a serum metabolomics approach based on liquid chromatography\u2012mass spectrometry (LC\u2012MS) technology. Differentially abundant metabolites were screened via multivariate statistical analysis. In addition, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) analyses were conducted to identify the key metabolites in infants with sepsis and without infections. The random forest algorithm was applied to determine key differentially abundant metabolites between sepsis infants with and without comorbidities. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for biomarker value testing. Finally, a metabolic pathway analysis was conducted to explore the metabolic and signaling pathways associated with the identified differentially abundant metabolites. RESULTS: A total of 189 metabolites exhibited significant differences between infectious infants and noninfectious infants, while 137 distinct metabolites exhibited differences between septic infants with and without comorbidities. After screening for the key differentially abundant metabolites using LASSO and SVM-RFE analyses, hexylamine, psychosine sulfate, LysoPC (18:1 (9Z)/0:0), 2,4,6-tribromophenol, and 25-cinnamoyl-vulgaroside were retained for the diagnosis of infant sepsis. ROC curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.9200 for hexylamine, 0.9749 for psychosine sulfate, 0.9684 for LysoPC (18:1 (9Z)/0:0), 0.7405 for 2,4,6-tribromophenol, 0.8893 for 25-cinnamoyl-vulgaroside, and 1.000 for the combination of all metabolites. When the septic infants with comorbidities were compared to those without comorbidities, four endogenous metabolites with the greatest importance were identified using the random forest algorithm, namely, 12-oxo-20-trihydroxy-leukotriene B4, dihydrovaltrate, PA (8:0/12:0), and 2-heptanethiol. The ROC curve analysis of these four key differentially abundant metabolites revealed that the AUC was 1 for all four metabolites. Pathway analysis indicated that phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and porphyrin metabolism play important roles in infant sepsis. CONCLUSION: Serum metabolite profiles were identified, and machine learning was applied to identify the key differentially abundant metabolites in septic infants with comorbidities, septic infants without comorbidities, and infants without infectious diseases. The findings obtained are expected to facilitate the early diagnosis of sepsis in infants and determine the severity of the disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The study aims to investigate the social, emotional, and behavioral challenges in children with a specific learning disability (SLD) and to identify the factors that accompany these problems by screening with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). METHODS: The descriptive study was conducted on 278 children with SLD. Strengths and difficulties in children were evaluated by the SDQ applied to their mothers. The percentage of cases above the cut-off limits of the SDQ was calculated. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis were used for analysis. RESULTS: The mean (SD) total SDQ score was 15.8 (6.5). The percentage of scores of abnormal total difficulties in SLD was 47.8%. Multivariate analysis revealed that cases exposed to antenatal smoking had higher odds ratio of abnormal emotional symptoms and abnormal total difficulties; cases with poor familial income and the presence of a history of antenatal smoking exposure showed considerably higher odds ratio of conduct problems; cases with younger age at the diagnosis of SLD, dyscalculia, extreme duration of preschool screen time (\u22654\u00a0h), and history of hospitalization had significantly higher odds ratio for hyperactivity-inattention problems; and cases having shorter breastfeeding duration had higher odds ratio of peer problems compared to counterparts. CONCLUSION: Children with SLD have a high score on the SDQ. Practitioners could especially give guidance and support to families with financial problems and those having a child with an early age at diagnosis, exposure to antenatal smoking, short breastfeeding period, early age of the first screen use, and long screen exposure duration during the preschool period.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aging is a complex and gradual biological process that represents the major risk factor with respect to the development of chronic degenerative diseases, often associated with disability. Diet and nu-trition, coupled with proper physical activity have a significant impact on the health status of the elderly with a decreased risk of disease being indicative of successful aging. Musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia are the most frequently reported disorders among the elderly community. METHODS: This study presents a systematic review of the literature on the potential benefits of several nutra-ceuticals in promoting healthy aging and in reducing the risk of chronic diseases in elderly individuals. RESULTS: Dietary components including vitamins (vitamin C, B vitamin and vitamin K) flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, anthocyanins, and isoflavones), minerals (e.g., magnesium, zinc and potassium) and other nutrients such phytoestrogens, amino acids, and omega-3 fatty acids help in slowing the aging process, which ultimately results in increased lifespan and longevity. CONCLUSIONS: This paper highlights the key nutrients and phytochemicals of nutraceutical importance for the healthy aging of the elderly population. Although the scientific literature provides evidences of therapeutic effectiveness of nutraceuticals, more in-depth clinical investigations are needed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An important problem of our day is the significant increase in the number of learning-disabled pupils all over the world. This has led to the emergence of  OBJECTIVE: This paper analyzes the role and functions of a neuropsychologist in primary schools and the possibilities of his/her collaboration with other specialists in diagnosing children's problems and organizing remediation for problematic kids. DESIGN: We established four steps for launching neuropsychological work at primary schools: 1) setting up a screening group for neuropsychological assessment of all children entering the first year of school; 2) a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of the children who showed poor results in the first step of the study; 3)ateam remediation program; and 4) evaluation of the remediation results by a new neuropsychological assessment at the end of the remediation program. RESULTS: The results of the first step of our study showed a very high percentage of children with cognitive problems- 37% of 202 6-8 year-old schoolchildren entering the first year of school. They formed a group at risk for future learning disabilities and maladjustment at school. Age and gender differences, and the structure of cognitive underdevelopment, were discussed in the second step of our study. In the third step, a team of school specialists, including a neuropsychologist, a teacher, a school psychologist, and a school social worker, implemented a remediation program which was created and supervised by a neuropsychologist. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of the pupils revealed a complex structure of cognitive disturbances which interfere with pupils' learning abilities in primary school. The team approach can efficiently prevent learning disabilities and help children with cognitive underdevelopment and risks of future unsuccess at school, when this collaboration of school specialists has a common theoretical approach and is based upon comprehensive neuropsychological assessment.",

        "title": "Clinical Implementation and Evaluation of Three Implementation Interventions for a Family-Oriented Care for Children of Mentally Ill Parents (ci-chimps): Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Multicenter Trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Germany, approximately three million children under the age of eighteen have a mentally ill parent. These children are at an increased risk of developing a mental illness themselves (1) as well as a physical illness (2). While research has identified numerous evidence-based family-oriented interventions, little is known about how to implement such interventions effectively and efficiently in clinical practice in Germany. This implementation study (ci-chimps) evaluates three clinical implementation projects with three different implementation interventions for the optimal implementation of the tailored family-oriented preventive and therapeutic interventions in the CHIMPS-NET (children of mentally ill parents-research network) with an implementation model for children of mentally ill parents. METHODS: A two-group randomized controlled multicenter trial will examine changes in family-oriented practice and aspects of implementation at baseline as well as at 12- and 24-months follow-up. The CHIMPS-Network consists of 20 clinical centers. The centers in the intervention group receive the support of all of the three implementation interventions: (1) optimal pathways to care, (2) education and a training program for professionals, and (3) systematic screening for children. The centers in the control group do not receive this specific implementation support. DISCUSSION: While we know that children of mentally ill parents are an important target group to be addressed by preventive and therapeutic interventions, there is often a lack of structured implementation of family-oriented interventions in clinical practice in Germany. Using a randomized controlled multicenter trial design with a large and wide-ranging sample (clinics for adult psychiatry and clinics for child and adolescent psychiatry, university clinics and clinics at the real health care) will provide a robust understanding of implementing family-oriented changes in German clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The CHIMPS-NET-study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register on 2019-12-19 (DRKS00020380) and with Clinical Trials on 2020-4-30 (NCT04369625), the ci-chimps-study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00026217) on 2021-08-27, the Clinical Trials registration is in review process.",

        "abstract": "Dependency on digital devices resulting in an ever-increasing daily screen time has subsequently also been the cause of several adverse effects on physical and mental or psychological health. Constant exposure to devices like smartphones, personal computers, and television can severely affect mental health- increase stress and anxiety, for example, and cause various sleep issues in both children as well as adults. Risk factors for obesity and cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, poor regulation of stress, low HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance are among the physical health repercussions we see. The psychological health effects comprise suicidal tendencies and symptoms of depression which are associated with digital device dependency, screen-time-induced poor sleep quality, and content-influenced negativity. Oftentimes it can cause the induction of a state of hyper-arousal, increase stress hormones, desynchronize the body clock or the circadian cycle, alter brain chemistry and create a drag on mental energy and development.

Conventional MPS, caused by inborn deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes involved in GAG degradation, display various multisystemic symptoms-including progressive neurological complications, ophthalmological disorders, hearing loss, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary issues, cardiorespiratory problems, bone and joint abnormalities, dwarfism, and coarse facial features. Mucopolysaccharidosis-Plus Syndrome (MPSPS), an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the endo-lysosomal tethering protein VPS33A, shows additional renal and hematopoietic abnormalities (\"Plus symptoms\") uncommon in conventional MPS. Here, we analyze data from biochemical, histological, and physical examinations-particularly of blood counts and kidney function-to further characterize the clinical phenotype of MPSPS. A series of blood tests indicate hematopoietic symptoms including progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia, which correlate with histological observations of hypoplastic bone marrow. High urinary excretion of protein (caused by impairments in renal filtration), hypoalbuminemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, cholesterol, and uric acid indicate renal dysfunction. Histological analyses of MPSPS kidneys similarly suggest the extensive destruction of glomerular structures by foamy podocytes.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess Gram-positive bacterial (GPB) bloodstream infection (BSI) in neonates, covering incidence, morbidity, mortality, antimicrobial resistance patterns and biomarkers in Region Stockholm, Sweden between 2006 and 2016. METHODS: A population-based retrospective epidemiological study including infants with GPB-BSI, admitted to the neonatal units at Karolinska University Hospital (KUH). Data were collected from patient records, the Swedish Neonatal Quality Register, the microbiological laboratory at KUH and the Swedish Public Health Agency. RESULTS: We identified 357 infants with GPB-BSI, representing an incidence of 1.47/1000 live births (LB). Group B streptococcus (GBS) was the most common pathogen causing BSI in full-term infants and early-onset sepsis (EOS) (0.20/1000 LB), while coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were predominant in infants born very preterm and in late-onset sepsis (LOS) (0.79/1000 LB). There were no fatal GBS BSI cases, but 10.2% developed meningitis. The GPB case fatality rate was 9.5% and the sepsis fatality rate 2.8%. In GPB-BSI, 1/10 did not have an elevated C-reactive protein level. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) BSI increased during the study period, but no methicillin or vancomycin resistant strains were found. The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rate was highest in CoNS isolates. CONCLUSION: GPB-BSI was four times more common than Gram-negative BSI in neonates but resulted in lower mortality rate. GBS was the most common pathogen in full-term infants and in EOS. CoNS was the most common pathogen in LOS and infants born very preterm, and the AMR rate was high in these isolates. The increasing trend of S. aureus BSI indicates a need of further investigation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method. The model has better diagnostic performance compared with conventional inflammatory indicators such as CRP, Hb, NEU%, and PCT.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition, occurring when an infectious agent invades the body, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2\u03bcg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin. Early detection of bacteria followed by antimicrobial susceptibility test can help by selection of appropriate antibiotic and prevent spread of infection.",

The purpose of the present study was to identify candidate genes of preterm infants who are susceptible to RSV infection and provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of RSV infection. METHODS: Three datasets (GSE77087, GSE69606 and GSE41374) containing 183 blood samples of RSV infected patients and 33 blood samples of healthy controls from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were downloaded and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out. The function and pathway enrichments were analyzed through Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for DEGs was constructed through Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). The module analysis was performed by Cytoscape software and hub genes were identified. Clinical verification was employed to verify the expression level of top five hub genes among 72 infants including 50 RSV infected patients and 22 non-RSV-infected patients hospitalized in our center. Further, the RSV infected infants with high-expression IFI27 and those with low-expression IFI27 were compared (defined as higher or lower than the median mRNA level). Finally, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) focusing on IFI27 was carried out. RESULTS: Totally, 4028 DEGs were screened out and among which, 131 most significant DEGs were selected. Subsequently, 13 hub genes were identified, and function and pathway enrichments of hub genes mainly were: response to virus, defense response to virus, regulation of viral genome replication and regulation of viral life cycle. Furthermore, IFI27 was confirmed to be the most significantly expressed in clinical verification. Gene sets associated with calcium signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix receptor interaction and so on were significantly enriched when IFI27 was highly expressed. Moreover, high-expression IFI27 was associated with more severe cases (p\u2009=\u20090.041), more requirements of mechanical ventilation (p\u2009=\u20090.034), more frequent hospitalization (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and longer cumulative hospital stay (p\u2009=\u20090.012). CONCLUSION: IFI27 might serve to predict RSV infection and evaluate the severity of RSV infection in preterm infants.",

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms \"sepsis,\" \"septicemia,\" or \"septic shock\" in the title or abstract. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001).

In the present study, a deep learning structure for mortality prediction of septic patients was developed and compared with several machine learning methods as well as two sepsis screening tools: the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA). The mortality predictions were explored for septic patients who died within 72 h and 28 days. Results demonstrated that the accuracy rate of deep learning methods, especially Convolutional Neural Network plus SoftMax (87.01% in 72 h and 81.59% in 28 d), exceeds that of the other machine learning methods, SIRS, and qSOFA.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize the bacterial causes of paediatric bloodstream infections in LMICs and their resistance profile. METHODS: We searched Pubmed and Embase databases between January 1st 1990 and October 30th 2019, combining MeSH and free-text terms for \"sepsis\" and \"low-middle-income countries\" in children. Two reviewers screened articles and performed data extraction to identify studies investigating children (1\u2009month-18\u2009years), with at least one blood culture. The main outcomes of interests were the rate of positive blood cultures, the distribution of bacterial pathogens, the resistance patterns and the case-fatality rate. The proportions obtained from each study were pooled using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation, and a random-effect meta-analysis model was used. RESULTS: We identified 2403 eligible studies, 17 were included in the final review including 52,915 children (11 in Africa and 6 in Asia). The overall percentage of positive blood culture was 19.1% [95% CI: 12.0-27.5%]; 15.5% [8.4-24.4%] in Africa and 28.0% [13.2-45.8%] in Asia. A total of 4836 bacterial isolates were included in the studies; 2974 were Gram-negative (63.9% [52.2-74.9]) and 1858 were Gram-positive (35.8% [24.9-47.5]). In Asia,  CONCLUSIONS: We observed a marked variation in pathogen distribution and their resistance profiles between Asia and Africa.

        "abstract": "The first days of postnatal life are energetically demanding as metabolic functions change dramatically to accommodate drastic environmental and physiologic transitions after birth. It is increasingly appreciated that metabolic pathways are not only crucial for nutrition but also play important roles in regulating inflammation and the host response to infection. Neonatal susceptibility to infection is increased due to a functionally distinct immune response characterized by high reliance on innate immune mechanisms. Interactions between metabolism and the immune response are increasingly recognized, as changes in metabolic pathways drive innate immune cell function and activation and consequently host response to pathogens. Moreover, metabolites, such as acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and succinate have immunoregulatory properties and serve as cofactors for enzymes involved in epigenetic reprogramming or \"training\" of innate immune cells after an initial infectious exposure. Highly sensitive metabolomic approaches allow us to define alterations in metabolic signatures as they change during ontogeny and as perturbed by immunization or infection, thereby linking metabolic pathways to immune cell effector functions. Characterizing the ontogeny of immunometabolism will offer new opportunities to prevent, diagnose, and treat neonatal sepsis.",

        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Overrepresentation analysis (ORA) is used widely to assess the enrichment of functional categories in a gene list compared to a background list. ORA is therefore a critical method in the interpretation of 'omics data, relating gene lists to biological functions and themes. Although ORA is hugely popular, we and others have noticed two potentially undesired behaviours of some ORA tools. The first one we call the 'background problem', because it involves the software eliminating large numbers of genes from the background list if they are not annotated as belonging to any category. The second one we call the 'false discovery rate problem', because some tools underestimate the true number of parallel tests conducted. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate the impact of these issues on several real RNA-seq datasets and use simulated RNA-seq data to quantify the impact of these problems. We show that the severity of these problems depends on the gene set library, the number of genes in the list, and the degree of noise in the dataset. These problems can be mitigated by changing packages/websites for ORA or by changing to another approach such as functional class scoring.

However, an excess or deficiency of iron is related to certain pathologies. The maintenance of iron homeostasis is essential to avoid certain pathologies related to iron excess or deficiency. The existence of iron deposits in postmortem tissues of Parkinson's patients has been interpreted as evidence that iron plays a fundamental role in the degenerative process of the nigrostriatal system in this disease. The use of iron chelators has been successful in the treatment of diseases such as transfusion-dependent thalassemia and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. However, a clinical study with the iron chelator deferiprone in patients with Parkinson's disease has not shown positive effects but rather worsened clinical symptoms.

        "title": "The pyrethroids metabolite 3-phenoxybenzoic acid induces dopaminergic degeneration.",
        "abstract": "Exposure to pyrethroids, a significant class of the most widely used agricultural chemicals, has been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, although many different pyrethroids induce roughly the same symptoms of Parkinsonism, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To find the shared key features among these mechanisms, we focused on 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common and prominent metabolite of most pyrethroids produced via hydrolysis by CEs in mammals. To determine the contribution of 3-PBA to the initiation and progression of PD, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively, and found that 3-PBA not only accumulates in murine brain tissues over time but also further induces PD-like pathologies (increased \u03b1-syn and phospho-S129, decreased TH) to the same or even greater extent than the precursor pyrethroid. A before-after study of PET-DAT in the same mice revealed that low concentrations of 3-PBA (0.5 mg/kg) could paradoxically cause DAT to increase (22.46% higher than pre-drug test). The intervention of DAT inhibitors and activators respectively alleviated and enhanced the dopaminergic toxicity of 3-PBA, indicating that 3-PBA interacts with DAT. In particular, low concentrations of 3-PBA increase the DAT, which in turn induces 3-PBA to enter the dopaminergic neurons to exert toxic effects. Finally, we described a mechanism underlying this potential role of 3-PBA in the pathological aggregation of \u03b1-syn. Specifically, 3-PBA was found to dysregulate C/EBP \u03b2 levels and further anomalously activate AEP in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by increased accumulation of pathologically cleaved \u03b1-syn (N103 fragments) and accelerated \u03b1-syn aggregation. All these results suggest that 3-PBA exposure could mimic the pathological and pathogenetic features of PD, showing that this metabolite is a key pathogenic compound in pyrethroid-related pathological effects and a possible dopamine neurotoxin. Additionally, our findings provide a crucial reference for the primary prevention of PD.",

        "abstract": "Several years ago, dozens of cases were described in patients with symptoms very similar to mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). This new disease entity was described as mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome (MPSPS). The name of the disease indicates that in addition to the typical symptoms of conventional MPS, patients develop other features such as congenital heart defects and kidney and hematopoietic system disorders. The symptoms are highly advanced, and patients usually do not survive past the second year of life. MPSPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a homozygous-specific mutation in the gene encoding the VPS33A protein. To date, it has been described in 41 patients. Patients with MPSPS exhibited excessive excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the urine and exceptionally high levels of heparan sulfate in the plasma, but the accumulation of substrates is not caused by a decrease in the activity of any lysosomal enzymes. Here, we discuss the pathomechanisms and symptoms of MPSPS, comparing them to those of MPS. Moreover, we asked the question whether MPSPS should be classified as a type of MPS or a separate disease, as contrary to 'classical' MPS types, despite GAG accumulation, no defects in lysosomal enzymes responsible for degradation of these compounds could be detected in MPSPS. The molecular mechanism of the appearance of GAG accumulation in MPSPS is suggested on the basis of results available in the literature.",

        "title": "Elucidating Conserved Transcriptional Networks Underlying Pesticide Exposure and Parkinson's Disease: A Focus on Chemicals of Epidemiological Relevance.",
        "abstract": "While a number of genetic mutations are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), it is also widely acknowledged that the environment plays a significant role in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Epidemiological evidence suggests that occupational exposure to pesticides (e.g., dieldrin, paraquat, rotenone, maneb, and ziram) is associated with a higher risk of developing PD in susceptible populations. Within dopaminergic neurons, environmental chemicals can have an array of adverse effects resulting in cell death, such as aberrant redox cycling and oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, unfolded protein response, ubiquitin-proteome system dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and metabolic disruption. More recently, our understanding of how pesticides affect cells of the central nervous system has been strengthened by computational biology. New insight has been gained about transcriptional and proteomic networks, and the metabolic pathways perturbed by pesticides. These networks and cell signaling pathways constitute potential therapeutic targets for intervention to slow or mitigate neurodegenerative diseases. Here we review the epidemiological evidence that supports a role for specific pesticides in the etiology of PD and identify molecular profiles amongst these pesticides that may contribute to the disease. Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, these transcripts were compared to those regulated by the PD-associated neurotoxicant MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine). While many transcripts are already established as those related to PD (alpha-synuclein, caspases, leucine rich repeat kinase 2, and parkin2), lesser studied targets have emerged as \"pesticide/PD-associated transcripts\" [e.g., phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class C (Pigc), allograft inflammatory factor 1 (Aif1), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3, and DNA damage inducible transcript 4]. We also compared pesticide-regulated genes to a recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in PD which revealed new genetic mutant alleles; the pesticides under review regulated the expression of many of these genes (e.g., ELOVL fatty acid elongase 7, ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a1, and bridging integrator 3). The significance is that these proteins may contribute to pesticide-related increases in PD risk. This review collates information on transcriptome responses to PD-associated pesticides to develop a mechanistic framework for quantifying PD risk with exposures.",

        "abstract": "Despite several years of research, the aetiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is quite far from being solved. In PD, as well as in other neurodegenerative disorders, it has been proposed that the combination of multiple factors might contribute to the onset of the disease. Indeed, several authors have suggested that environmental factors, such as pollutants and chemicals, might be associated with the onset of several neurodegenerative disorders. On the other hand, several studies have described that the nociceptin/orphanin-NOP and prodynorphin-KOP opioid systems are implicated in the pathology of Parkinson's disease. Considering the nonrestricted commercial availability and common use of several pesticides, such as paraquat and maneb, in agriculture of less developed countries, the aim of our study was to investigate the involvement of nociceptin/orphanin-NOP and prodynorphin-KOP systems in a chronic paraquat and maneb animal model of Parkinson's disease. Our results showed that after paraquat/maneb (5/15 mg kg(-1) ) treatment, a significant reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis, was observed. Also, the association of paraquat and maneb (5/15 mg kg(-1) ) induced an increase in nociceptin/orphanin and a decrease of prodynorphin gene expression levels in the substantia nigra with a down-regulation of NOP and KOP receptors after both treatments in the substantia nigra and caudate putamen. These data further confirm that paraquat and maneb toxicity can modulate gene expression of the nociceptin/orphanin-NOP receptor and prodynorphin-KOP receptor systems in the substantia nigra and caudate putamen, offering further support to the hypothesis that chronic exposure to these agrochemicals might be implicated in the mechanisms underlying sporadic Parkinson's disease. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Specifically, we discussed randomized clinical trials in subjects with Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis bearing pathogenic gene mutations, and glucocerebrosidase-associated Parkinson's disease. Learning potential lessons to improve future therapeutic approaches is the aim of this review. Two long-term, controlled trials on three anti-\u03b2-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab and crenezumab) in subjects carrying Alzheimer's disease-linked mutated genes encoding for amyloid precursor protein or presenilin 1 or presenilin 2 failed to show cognitive or functional benefits. A major trial on tominersen, an antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce the production of the huntingtin protein in subjects with Huntington's disease, was prematurely interrupted because the drug failed to show higher efficacy than placebo and, at highest doses, led to worsened outcomes. A 28-week trial of tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide for superoxide dismutase 1 in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with superoxide dismutase 1 gene mutations failed to show significant beneficial effects but the 1-year open label extension of this study indicated better clinical and functional outcomes in the group with early tofersen therapy. A trial of venglustat, a potent and brain-penetrant glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, in Parkinson's disease subjects with heterozygous glucocerebrosidase gene mutations revealed worsened clinical and cognitive performance of patients on the enzyme inhibitor compared to placebo. We concluded that clinical trials in neurodegenerative diseases with a genetic basis should test monoclonal antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides or gene editing directed against the mutated enzyme or the mutated substrate without dramatically affecting physiological wild-type variants.",

        "abstract": "The potential health effects of exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) remain largely unexplored. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "Discoidin Domain Receptor (DDR)-1 is activated by collagen. Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is FDA-approved for leukemia and potently inhibits DDR-1. Individuals diagnosed with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) treated with nilotinib (versus placebo) for 12\u00a0months showed reduction of amyloid plaque and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid, and attenuation of hippocampal volume loss. However, the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we explored unbiased next generation whole genome miRNA sequencing from AD patients CSF and miRNAs were matched with their corresponding mRNAs using gene ontology. Changes in CSF miRNAs were confirmed via measurement of CSF DDR1 activity and plasma levels of AD biomarkers. Approximately 1050 miRNAs are detected in the CSF but only 17 miRNAs are specifically altered between baseline and 12-month treatment with nilotinib versus placebo. Treatment with nilotinib significantly reduces collagen and DDR1 gene expression (upregulated in AD brain), in association with inhibition of CSF DDR1. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins and chemokines are reduced along with caspase-3 gene expression. Specific genes that indicate vascular fibrosis, e.g., collagen, Transforming Growth Factors (TGFs) and Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteases (TIMPs) are altered by DDR1 inhibition with nilotinib. Specific changes in vesicular transport, including the neurotransmitters dopamine and acetylcholine, and autophagy genes, including ATGs, indicate facilitation of autophagic flux and cellular trafficking. Inhibition of DDR1 with nilotinib may be a safe and effective adjunct treatment strategy involving an oral drug that enters the CNS and adequately engages its target. DDR1 inhibition with nilotinib exhibits multi-modal effects not only on amyloid and tau clearance but also on anti-inflammatory markers that may reduce cerebrovascular fibrosis.",

        "title": "Male contraception: narrative review of ongoing research.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the release of the combined oral contraceptive pill in 1960, women have shouldered the burden of contraception and family planning. Over 60 years later, this is still the case as the only practical, effective contraceptive options available to men are condoms and vasectomy. However, there are now a variety of promising hormonal and non-hormonal male contraceptive options being studied. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide clinicians and laypeople with focused, up-to-date descriptions of novel strategies and targets for male contraception. We include a cautiously optimistic discussion of benefits and potential drawbacks, highlighting several methods in preclinical and clinical stages of development. RESULTS: As of June 2023, two hormonal male contraceptive methods are undergoing phase II clinical trials for safety and efficacy. A large-scale, international phase IIb trial investigating efficacy of transdermal segesterone acetate (Nestorone) plus testosterone gel has enrolled over 460 couples with completion estimated for late 2024. A second hormonal method, dimethandrolone undecanoate, is in two clinical trials focusing on safety, pharmacodynamics, suppression of spermatogenesis and hormones; the first of these two is estimated for completion in December 2024. There are also several non-hormonal methods with strong potential in preclinical stages of development. CONCLUSIONS: There exist several hurdles to novel male contraception. Therapeutic development takes decades of time, meticulous work, and financial investment, but with so many strong candidates it is our hope that there will soon be several safe, effective, and reversible contraceptive options available to male patients.

Plus de 60 ans plus tard, c\u2019est toujours le cas, car les seules options contraceptives pratiques et efficaces disponibles pour les hommes sont les pr\u00e9servatifs et la vasectomie. Cependant, il existe maintenant une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019options contraceptives masculines hormonales et non hormonales prometteuses qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude. Le but de cette revue narrative est de fournir aux cliniciens et aux profanes des descriptions cibl\u00e9es et \u00e0 jour de nouvelles strat\u00e9gies et cibles pour la contraception masculine. Nous incluons une discussion prudemment optimiste sur les avantages et les inconv\u00e9nients potentiels, en soulignant plusieurs m\u00e9thodes aux stades pr\u00e9cliniques et cliniques du d\u00e9veloppement. R\u00e9SULTATS: En juin 2023, deux m\u00e9thodes contraceptives masculines hormonales faisaient l\u2019objet d\u2019essais cliniques de phase II pour leur innocuit\u00e9 et leur efficacit\u00e9.

Une seconde m\u00e9thode hormonale, l\u2019und\u00e9canoate de dim\u00e9thandrolone, fait l\u2019objet de deux essais cliniques ax\u00e9s sur l\u2019innocuit\u00e9, la pharmacodynamique, la suppression de la spermatogen\u00e8se et des hormones; le premier de ces deux essais devrait \u00eatre achev\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 2024. Il existe \u00e9galement plusieurs m\u00e9thodes non hormonales \u00e0 fort potentiel aux stades pr\u00e9cliniques de d\u00e9veloppement.

The existence of iron deposits in postmortem tissues of Parkinson's patients has been interpreted as evidence that iron plays a fundamental role in the degenerative process of the nigrostriatal system in this disease. The use of iron chelators has been successful in the treatment of diseases such as transfusion-dependent thalassemia and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. However, a clinical study with the iron chelator deferiprone in patients with Parkinson's disease has not shown positive effects but rather worsened clinical symptoms. This suggests that iron may not play a role in the degenerative process of Parkinson's disease.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess Gram-positive bacterial (GPB) bloodstream infection (BSI) in neonates, covering incidence, morbidity, mortality, antimicrobial resistance patterns and biomarkers in Region Stockholm, Sweden between 2006 and 2016. METHODS: A population-based retrospective epidemiological study including infants with GPB-BSI, admitted to the neonatal units at Karolinska University Hospital (KUH). Data were collected from patient records, the Swedish Neonatal Quality Register, the microbiological laboratory at KUH and the Swedish Public Health Agency. RESULTS: We identified 357 infants with GPB-BSI, representing an incidence of 1.47/1000 live births (LB). Group B streptococcus (GBS) was the most common pathogen causing BSI in full-term infants and early-onset sepsis (EOS) (0.20/1000 LB), while coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were predominant in infants born very preterm and in late-onset sepsis (LOS) (0.79/1000 LB). There were no fatal GBS BSI cases, but 10.2% developed meningitis. The GPB case fatality rate was 9.5% and the sepsis fatality rate 2.8%. In GPB-BSI, 1/10 did not have an elevated C-reactive protein level. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) BSI increased during the study period, but no methicillin or vancomycin resistant strains were found. The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rate was highest in CoNS isolates. CONCLUSION: GPB-BSI was four times more common than Gram-negative BSI in neonates but resulted in lower mortality rate. GBS was the most common pathogen in full-term infants and in EOS. CoNS was the most common pathogen in LOS and infants born very preterm, and the AMR rate was high in these isolates. The increasing trend of S. aureus BSI indicates a need of further investigation.",

Pathophysiology is poorly understood, and optimal treatment has not been established. METHODS: Geniospasm was characterized in a series of patients after evaluation in our clinics, and a comprehensive review of all cases in the medical literature was performed. RESULTS: We evaluated four patients (1 female) in four families with geniospasm, aged 4 months to 9 years. Bothersome symptoms were present in one patient, who was treated with regular injections of onabotulinumtoxinA, with complete resolution of symptoms and no adverse effects. 9 patients in the literature have had similar outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Limited data exist with regard to the effective treatment of geniospasm. Several treatments have been used historically, with variable outcomes. Our results, together with those of prior reported cases, demonstrate benefit of the use of botulinum toxin injections for management of this condition.",

        "abstract": "Cannabis use and somatic consequences. Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit psychoactive substance in the world. It is perceived as a low-risk drug, as it is a plant, although many warnings in the medical literature underlined increased complications of cannabis use. Acute and chronic cannabis use is known to be harmful inducing psychiatric and addictive effects. An increase in the potency of cannabis as defined by a high ratio between the more important components, tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol has been observed for years, which leads to more serious complications. Evidence indicates that both acute and chronic consumptions of cannabis can be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Effects of cannabis use include mood disorders, exacerbation of psychotic disorders in vulnerable people, cannabis use disorders, withdrawal syndrome, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular and respiratory and other diseases. Synthetic cannabinoid has rapidly spread for the last few years; they are chemical substances inducing similar psychoactive effects to cannabis. Although, cannabis users call these substances \"cannabis\", synthetic cannabinoids have different pharmacological properties, which make them dangerous substances leading to more serious complications. Physicians dealing with cannabis users should be aware of these differences between vegetal cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids. Complications somatiques du cannabis.

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition, occurring when an infectious agent invades the body, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2\u03bcg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin. Early detection of bacteria followed by antimicrobial susceptibility test can help by selection of appropriate antibiotic and prevent spread of infection.",

        "abstract": "The present study examined genetic, prenatal, and postnatal environmental pathways in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and depressive symptoms from parents to early adolescents (when these symptoms start to increase), while considering timing effects of exposure to parent anxiety and depressive symptoms postnatally. The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

        "title": "Engaging Black youth in depression and suicide prevention treatment within urban schools: study protocol for a randomized controlled pilot.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression continues to be an ongoing threat to adolescent well-being with Black adolescents being particularly vulnerable to greater burdens of depression as well as lower mental health service utilization. Black adolescents are likely to have untreated depression due to social network influences, varied perceptions of services and providers, or self-stigma associated with experiencing depressive symptoms. Furthermore, if or when treatment is initiated, low engagement and early termination are common. To address this gap, a trial is being conducted to preliminarily test the effectiveness of an engagement intervention targeting Black adolescents with depression in school mental health services in New York City. METHODS: A total of 60 Black middle and high school adolescents displaying depressive symptoms are equally randomized (based on school site) to the treatment arms. Both trial arms deliver Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents (IPT-A), a time-limited, evidence-based treatment for depression. Additionally, one arm pairs IPT-A with a brief, multi-level engagement intervention, the Making Connections Intervention (MCI), involving adolescents, caregivers, and clinicians. Outcomes of interest are group differences in depression and suicide ideation, adolescent and caregiver engagement, and mental health service use. DISCUSSION: This trial will serve as an efficacy assessment of the MCI among a sample of Black adolescent students with depressive symptoms. Clinical and implementation results will be used to inform future research to further test the MCI intervention in a larger sample.

        "title": "Association of Interparental Violence and Maternal Depression With Depression Among Adolescents at the Population and Individual Level.",
        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Parental intimate partner violence (IPV) and maternal depression are associated with increased risk of depression in children at the population level. However, it is not known whether having information about these experiences can accurately identify individual children at higher risk of depression. OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which experiencing parental IPV and/or maternal depression before age 12 years is associated with depression at age 18 years at the population and individual level. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a UK population-based birth cohort, which initially recruited pregnant mothers with estimated due dates in 1991 and 1992. Data used in this study were collected from 1991 to 2009. Data analysis was performed from February to March 2022. EXPOSURES: Mother-reported parental IPV was assessed on 8 occasions (child age, 1-11 years). Maternal depression was assessed via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale or by the mother taking medication for depression, as reported by the mother on 8 occasions (child age, 2-12 years). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Depressive symptoms were measured with the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) and Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) when the child was aged 18 years. Binary indicators of a case of depression were derived the cutoff point of 11 points or above for the SMFQ and 12 points or above for the CIS-R. RESULTS: The study included 5029 children (2862 girls [56.9%]; 2167 boys [43.1%]) with a measure of depressive symptoms at age 18 years. IPV only was associated with a 24% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.97-1.59) higher risk of depression at age 18 years, exposure to maternal depression only was associated with a 35% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.11-1.64) higher risk, and exposure to both IPV and maternal depression was associated with a 68% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.34-2.10) higher risk. At the individual level, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.55-0.60) for depression according to the SMFQ and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.55-0.62) for the CIS-R, indicating a 58% to 59% probability (ie, 8%-9% above chance) that a random participant with depression at age 18 years had been exposed to IPV and/or maternal depression compared with a random participant who did not have depression. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, parental IPV and maternal depression were associated with depression in adolescence at the population level. However, estimation of an individual developing depression in adolescence based only on information about IPV or maternal depression is poor. Screening children for maternal depression and IPV to target interventions to prevent adolescent depression will fail to identify many children who might benefit and may unnecessarily target many others who do not develop depression.",

        "abstract": "Depression rates in young people have risen sharply in the past decade, especially in females, which is of concern because adolescence is a period of rapid social, emotional, and cognitive development and key life transitions. Adverse outcomes associated with depression in young people include depression recurrence; the onset of other psychiatric disorders; and wider, protracted impairments in interpersonal, social, educational, and occupational functioning. Thus, prevention and early intervention for depression in young people are priorities. Preventive and early intervention strategies typically target predisposing factors, antecedents, and symptoms of depression. Young people who have a family history of depression, exposure to social stressors (eg, bullying, discordant relationships, or stressful life events), and belong to certain subgroups (eg, having a chronic physical health problem or being a sexual minority) are at especially high risk of depression. Clinical antecedents include depressive symptoms, anxiety, and irritability. Evidence favours indicated prevention and targeted prevention to universal prevention. Emerging school-based and community-based social interventions show some promise. Depression is highly heterogeneous; therefore, a stepwise treatment approach is recommended, starting with brief psychosocial interventions, then a specific psychological therapy, and then an antidepressant medication.",

        "abstract": "Background Public health measures taken to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic can potentially impact the mental health of children. We assessed the prevalence and risk factors for childhood depression during the Covid-19 lockdown. Methods After 100 days of lockdown, we sent a survey questionnaire by WhatsApp to parents of school-aged children (5-16 years) in Chennai. The Short Mood and Feelings questionnaire was used as an objective screening tool to assess depression, with a score of 12 as the cut-off. Results There were 874 responses. The prevalence of childhood depression was 13.7%. Girls were more likely to be depressed than boys; 11-16-year-olds were more likely to be depressed than 5-10-year-old children. Children who had more than 4 hours online education had a higher likelihood of depression. Those who used a cell phone for online classes had a higher likelihood of depression compared to other devices, such as tabs or laptops. Children who slept less than 8 hours a day had a higher likelihood of depression while those who either did not sleep in the afternoon or slept less than 1 hour had a lower likelihood of depression. Children who were interacting with family over 1 hour per day had a lower likelihood of depression. Conclusion Overzealous online education, lack of adequate sleep and failure to spend quality time with the family can negatively impact the mental health of children. The impact of Covid-19 on the emotional health of children should be addressed by public health policy-makers and healthcare professionals.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Child suicidal behavior is related to specific childhood variations, constituting risk factors, including predisposing factors, internal factors, and environmental factors. OBJECTIVE: To characterize suicidal behavior among children aged 5 to 12 years diagnosed with a depressive episode. METHODS: Fifteen participants, aged 5 to 12, were assessed at a child and adolescent mental health center in Belo Horizonte, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. All participants had a history of suicide attempt and were in a depressive episode at the time of assessment. RESULTS: Vulnerabilities related to the children themselves were self-harm, aggression, loss of an important family figure, sexual abuse, sexuality disorders, use of alcohol or other drugs, and ill-treatment. Factors of family structure and dynamics found were psychiatric illness in family members, family conflict or violence, abandonment or rejection, history of suicidal behavior in family, parents users of alcohol and other drugs, and separated parents. Factors related to school were bullying, school difficulties/delays, high school performance, bad behavior, physical aggression, school dropout, and aggressiveness. The main methods used in suicide attempts were injury by sharp or blunt objects and intentional self-poisoning. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric comorbidities and a previous history of disturbances in the family and at school are important factors to consider with relation to suicidal behavior by children with depressive episodes.",

        "abstract": "AIM: Maternal stress during pregnancy has been associated with negative outcomes in children. We examined the risk factors for symptoms of depression in 11-year-old children, including the interaction between birthweight and other variables. METHODS: We collected maternal, obstetric and demographic information from birth through to the age of 11. Approximately, half of the 609 children were born small-for-gestational-age (SGA). Information collected at 3.5 and 7 years of age included intelligence testing and parent-reported behavioural and emotional development. At 11 years of age, the children completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children. Multivariable logistic regression analysis examined the relationship between self-reported symptoms of moderate to severe depression at the age of 11 and explanatory variables. RESULTS: Symptoms of moderate to severe depression were related to increasing maternal stress during pregnancy, young maternal age, lower intelligence test scores at 7-years-old and being bullied at school in the previous 6 months. There was also a significant interaction between maternal stress in pregnancy and symptoms of depression in 11-year-old children born SGA. CONCLUSION: Increasing maternal stress during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of symptoms of moderate to severe depression in 11-year-old children, especially those who were born SGA.",

        "abstract": "This study tested whether childhood parental emotional abuse and peer emotional bullying serve as antecedents of depression in adolescence and identified the cognitive mechanisms involved in this process. It was hypothesized that the experience of emotional abuse would predict depressive symptoms via development of rumination and negative inferences. A 3-wave longitudinal study was carried out with 998 adolescents (471 girls and 526 boys) between 13 and 17\u00a0years of age. Results showed that emotional abuse by parents and peers at Time 1 predicted a worsening of several cognitive vulnerabilities at Time 2. In addition, brooding mediated between the experiences of abuse and the increase of depressive symptoms at Time 3. Thus, findings suggest that the experiences of childhood emotional abuse by parents and peers serve as antecedents to develop a negative cognitive style, vulnerability that, once developed, is a risk factor for the onset of depressive symptoms in adolescence.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. We assessed population-based incidence and outcomes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis in children in Switzerland. METHODS: We did a multicentre, prospective, cohort study at ten paediatric hospitals in Switzerland. We included neonates and children younger than 17 years with blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis. Children were eligible if they met criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome-according to 2005 paediatric consensus definition- at the time of blood culture sampling. Incidence was calculated by dividing the number of annual sepsis episodes in the study for the years 2012-15 by the end-of-year resident paediatric population in Switzerland. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in the first 30 days after sepsis onset. FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2011, and Dec 31, 2015, we enrolled 1096 children to our study. Of 1181 episodes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis, 382 (32%) occurred in 379 previously healthy children, 402 (34%) in 391 neonates, and 397 (34%) in 341 children with comorbidities. Incidence was 25\u00b71 cases per 100\u2008000 (95% CI 23\u00b78-26\u00b74) in children and 146\u00b70 cases per 100\u2008000 (133\u00b72-159\u00b76) in neonates. Central line-associated bloodstream infections and primary bloodstream infections accounted for 569 (48%) of 1181 episodes, and organ dysfunction was present in 455 (39%) of 1181 episodes. Escherichia coli (242 of 1181 [20%]), Staphylococcus aureus (177 of 1181 [15%]), coagulase-negative staphylococci (135 of 1181 [11%]), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (118 of 1181 [10%]) were the most prevalent pathogens in our study, accounting for 57% of episodes. The overall case-fatality ratio was 7% (82 of 1181 episodes; 95% CI 5\u00b76-8\u00b76), and it was higher in neonates (11%, 45 of 402 episodes; 8\u00b74-14\u00b78; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 4\u00b741, 95% CI 1\u00b775-11\u00b71) and children with comorbidities (7%, 27 of 397 episodes; 4\u00b76-9\u00b79; OR 4\u00b797, 1\u00b784-13\u00b74) compared with previously healthy children (3%, ten of 382 episodes; 1\u00b73-4\u00b79). The case-fatality ratio was 1% (five of 726 episodes [95% CI 0\u00b73-1\u00b77]) for children without organ dysfunction, which increased to 17% (77 of 455 episodes [13\u00b77-20\u00b78]) when organ dysfunction was present (adjusted OR 4\u00b784, 95% CI 1\u00b740-16\u00b77). INTERPRETATION: The burden of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis on child health remains considerable. We recorded key differences in predominant organisms, severity, and outcome between neonates, previously healthy children, and children with comorbidities. Although for most episodes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis, no organ dysfunction was seen, presence of organ dysfunction was strongly associated with mortality.

        "abstract": "Several years ago, dozens of cases were described in patients with symptoms very similar to mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). This new disease entity was described as mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome (MPSPS). The name of the disease indicates that in addition to the typical symptoms of conventional MPS, patients develop other features such as congenital heart defects and kidney and hematopoietic system disorders. The symptoms are highly advanced, and patients usually do not survive past the second year of life. MPSPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a homozygous-specific mutation in the gene encoding the VPS33A protein. To date, it has been described in 41 patients. Patients with MPSPS exhibited excessive excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the urine and exceptionally high levels of heparan sulfate in the plasma, but the accumulation of substrates is not caused by a decrease in the activity of any lysosomal enzymes. Here, we discuss the pathomechanisms and symptoms of MPSPS, comparing them to those of MPS. Moreover, we asked the question whether MPSPS should be classified as a type of MPS or a separate disease, as contrary to 'classical' MPS types, despite GAG accumulation, no defects in lysosomal enzymes responsible for degradation of these compounds could be detected in MPSPS. The molecular mechanism of the appearance of GAG accumulation in MPSPS is suggested on the basis of results available in the literature.",

        "title": "Is trofinetide a future treatment for Rett syndrome? A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare, life-threatening, genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. Treatment in RTT encounters many challenges. Trofinetide, a modified amino-terminal tripeptide of insulin-like growth factor 1, has demonstrated clinically promising results in RTT. In this study, trofinetide efficacy and safety in RTT are systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed. METHODS: A systematic search of five electronic databases was conducted until January 2024. Review Manager 5.4 software was used for the analysis. The analysis was based on a weighted mean difference and standard error with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, and a statistically significant P-value was considered if it was\u2009<\u20090.05. The study was registered on PROSPERO with registration number CRD42024499849. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS: Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 276 patients were included in the analysis. Trofinetide improved both caregiver outcomes and clinical scales by improving the Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ) (mean difference (MD):\u2009-\u20093.46 points, 95% CI:\u2009-\u20095.63 to\u2009-\u20091.27, P\u2009=\u20090.0002) and Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I) (MD:\u2009-\u20090.35, 95% CI:\u2009-\u20090.51 to\u2009-\u20090.18, P\u2009<\u20090.0001), respectively. However, trofinetide neither improved the Caregiver Top 3 Concerns Visual Analog Scale nor the Rett Motor Behavioral Assessment. Regarding safety, trofinetide was significantly associated with vomiting compared to placebo (odds ratio (OR): 3.17, 95% CI: 1.57 to 6.43, P\u2009=\u20090.001). After solving heterogeneity, results showed a statistically significant incidence of diarrhea in the trofinetide (200\u00a0mg) group compared to placebo (OR: 18.51, 95% CI: 9.30 to 36.84, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Trofinetide demonstrated statistically significant improvements in CGI-I and RSBQ in pediatrics and adult patients with Rett. Side effects are limited to vomiting and diarrhea. Although diarrhea yielded an insignificant result in our analysis, it emerged as a cause for treatment discontinuation in the participating trials, and a statistically significant risk for diarrhea emerged when excluding the study using a lower dose of the drug, hence causing heterogeneity, in the\u00a0meta-analysis. Given the diverse genetic landscape of RTT, future RCTs investigating correlations between RTT genotype and phenotypic improvements by trofinetide will be beneficial. RCTs encompassing male patients with larger and longer cohorts are recommended.",

        "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare disability causing female-oriented pediatric neurodevelopmental unmet medical need. RTT was recognized in 1966. However, over the past 56 years, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has authorized no effective treatment for RTT. Recently, Trofinetide was approved by the USFDA on 10 March 2023 as the first RTT treatment. This article underlines the pharmaceutical advancement, patent literature, and prospects of Trofinetide. The data for this study were gathered from the PubMed database, authentic websites (Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Neuren Pharmaceuticals, and USFDA), and free patent databases. Trofinetide was first disclosed by Neuren Pharmaceuticals in 2000 as a methyl group containing analog of the naturally occurring neuroprotective tripeptide called glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE). The joint efforts of Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Neuren Pharmaceuticals have developed Trofinetide. The mechanism of action of Trofinetide is not yet well established. However, it is supposed to improve neuronal morphology and synaptic functioning. The patent literature revealed a handful of inventions related to Trofinetide, providing excellent and unexplored broad research possibilities with Trofinetide. The development of innovative Trofinetide-based molecules, combinations of Trofinetide, patient-compliant drug formulations, and precise MECP2-mutation-related personalized medicines are foreseeable. Trofinetide is in clinical trials for some neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including treating Fragile X syndrome (FXS). It is expected that Trofinetide may be approved for treating FXS in the future. The USFDA-approval of Trofinetide is one of the important milestones for RTT therapy and is the beginning of a new era for the therapy of RTT, FXS, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), brain injury, stroke, and other NDDs.",

It results from mutation in MECP2 gene in the long arm (q) of the X chromosome. OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide is a recently developed drug that has a neuroprotective effect on neurons, and it is our aim in this meta-analysis to evaluate its efficacy and safety in treating Rett syndrome patients. METHODS: We searched 5 databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Trofinetide and placebo in patients with Rett syndrome until August 13, 2023.Our primary outcomes were the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI) and the Rett syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ). We used Risk of Bias Assessment tool-2 (ROB2) to assess the methodological quality of the included randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: Three RCTs with a total of 325 patients were included with a follow-up duration ranging from one month to three months. 186 patients received the intervention drug (Trofinetide) and 138 received the placebo. Trofinetide was found to reduce CGI and RSBQ significantly more than placebo (MD\u2009=\u2009-0.35, 95% CI [-0.52 to -0.18], P 0.0001), (MD\u2009=\u2009-3.40, 95% CI [-3.69 to -3.12], P 0.00001) respectively.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method.

Trofinetide is efficacious within the target exposure range, supporting the approved dosing regimen for trofinetide. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01703533, NCT02715115, NCT04181723. Trofinetide is the first approved treatment for people living with Rett syndrome, a rare genetic condition affecting brain development. This approval was based on the findings of clinical studies in which trofinetide showed significant improvements in the symptoms of Rett syndrome. In this study researchers were looking to see if the level of trofinetide in the blood was related to the level of improvement in symptoms observed in clinical studies. Information on the effectiveness of trofinetide was obtained from the phase\u00a03 LAVENDER study which used doses of trofinetide according to body weight. Trofinetide\u2019s effectiveness was assessed on the basis of clinical measurements of key Rett syndrome symptoms. All the information on trofinetide dose, blood levels, and how much symptoms changed (i.e., effectiveness of trofinetide) was then used to develop models to predict symptom responses in the observed population. Researchers found that as the blood levels of trofinetide increased the symptom improvement also increased. When the blood levels were at the recommended level that was achieved in the LAVENDER study, the model predicted that symptom improvement was up to seven times greater with trofinetide than having no treatment (i.e., placebo). This study shows a positive relationship between trofinetide blood levels and improvement in the symptoms of Rett syndrome. Trofinetide was effective within the recommended blood level range in the LAVENDER study using the approved weight-based dosing.",

CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in the treatment of R/R childhood B-ALL, although the majority of reports have been in noninfant patients. Barriers to the successful implementation of CAR T-cell therapy in infant B-ALL include challenges related to apheresis, product manufacturing, and disease-specific considerations such as lineage switch. We describe our experience using 2 experimental CD19 CAR T-cell products, SCRI-CAR19 or SCRI-CAR19x22, for 19 patients with R/R infant B-ALL enrolled in 3 clinical trials. CAR T-cell products were successfully manufactured in 18 of 19 (94.7%) patients, with a median age of 22.5\u00a0months at enrollment (range, 14.5-40.1). Of 17 (94.1%) treated patients, 16 achieved a complete remission without detectable minimal residual disease. The 1-year leukemia-free survival was 75%, and 1-year overall survival was 76.5%, with a median follow-up time of 35.8\u00a0months (range, 1.7-83.6). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 14 of 17 (82.4%) patients, with only 1 patient experiencing grade 3 CRS. Neurotoxicity occurred in 2 of 17 (11.8%) patients with all events grade \u22642. With the successful early clinical experience of CAR T-cell therapy in this population, more systematic evaluation specific to infant ALL is warranted.",

Promising pre-clinical and clinical data of CAR T-cell activity have emerged from targeting surface antigens such as GD2 and B7H3 in childhood cancer neuroblastoma. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is expressed in a majority of neuroblastomas at low antigen density but is largely absent from healthy tissues. METHODS: To explore an alternate target antigen for neuroblastoma CAR T-cell therapy, the authors generated and screened a single-chain variable fragment library targeting ALK extracellular domain to make a panel of new anti-ALK CAR T-cell constructs. RESULTS: A lead novel CAR T-cell construct was capable of specific cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma cells expressing low levels of ALK, but with only weak cytokine and proliferative T-cell responses. To explore strategies for amplifying ALK CAR T cells, the authors generated a co-CAR approach in which T cells received signal 1 from a first-generation ALK construct and signal 2 from anti-B7H3 or GD2 chimeric co-stimulatory receptors. The co-CAR approach successfully demonstrated the ability to avoid targeting single-antigen-positive targets as a strategy for mitigating on-target off-tumor toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further proof of concept for ALK as a neuroblastoma CAR T-cell target.",

Outcomes are particularly poor for children with refractory, relapsed, or metastatic disease. Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cells are an exciting form of adoptive cell therapy that potentially offers new hope for these children. In early trials, promising outcomes have been achieved in some pediatric patients with sarcoma. However, many children do not derive benefit despite significant expression of the targeted tumor antigen. The success of CAR T cell therapy in sarcomas and other solid tumors is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we provide an update of the CAR T cell therapies that are currently being tested in pediatric sarcoma clinical trials, including those targeting tumors that express HER2, NY-ESO, GD2, EGFR, GPC3, B7-H3, and MAGE-A4. We also outline promising new CAR T cells that are in pre-clinical development. Finally, we discuss strategies that are being used to overcome tumor-mediated immunosuppression in solid tumors; these strategies have the potential to improve clinical outcomes of CAR T cell therapy for children with sarcoma.",

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) is a relatively new treatment for pediatric leukemia and has been the focus of recent advancements. CAR is manufactured to express T cells through various ways such as using retroviruses, transposons and transposase, electroporation, and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Together, it provides flexibility since it recognizes proteins without the need of antigen processing and presentation, can recognize carbohydrates and lipids, and it has been proven to be cost-effective. Despite these benefits however, problems faced by this therapy include unrecognized tumor proteins possibly escaping the system, CAR T cell expression being transient, and the therapy being one of the most expensive cancer drug ever approved. As a result, recent progress has been ongoing where researchers have combined CAR-T cells with natural killer (NK) cells and different cytokines to maximize its efficacy and potency while limiting potential risks such as cytokine release syndrome. Consequently, these cells gained the ability to be universal-being able to be used to treat multiple patients, maintain viability for a longer period, and prevent relapse.",

Despite having potentially life-threatening toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, the benefits of CAR T-cell therapy far outweigh these risks, particularly as increased experience and improved supportive care measures are mitigating these toxicities. CAR T cells can result in complete remission for significant proportion of patients with relapsed and refractory B-ALL and permit them to proceed to potentially curative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). CAR T cells may also be curative by themselves. Herein lie the greatest challenges and questions for clinical investigators, specifically, how are CAR T cells best employed and how do we overcome mechanisms of resistance to them? The primary clinical question is the timing and even the necessity of allo-HSCT. Relative to resistance, we know that target antigen loss, specifically CD19, is a major contributor to resistance. However, current investigations of alternative targets, such CD22, and CAR T cells expressing dual targeting antigen receptors have demonstrated encouraging initial results and provide a high degree of optimism that the efficacy and the broader application of CAR T-cell therapy will gradually increase in B-ALL. That optimism is not as high and the challenges are increased for the application of CAR T cells in T-cell leukemias and acute myeloid leukemia due to the relative lack of suitable leukemia surface targets that are not also expressed on normal hematopoietic progenitors. Despite these significant challenges, considerable research is being conducted into the development of CAR T cells for these diseases utilizing unique technologies, which may be applicable to other diseases.",

Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2\u03bcg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess Gram-positive bacterial (GPB) bloodstream infection (BSI) in neonates, covering incidence, morbidity, mortality, antimicrobial resistance patterns and biomarkers in Region Stockholm, Sweden between 2006 and 2016. METHODS: A population-based retrospective epidemiological study including infants with GPB-BSI, admitted to the neonatal units at Karolinska University Hospital (KUH). Data were collected from patient records, the Swedish Neonatal Quality Register, the microbiological laboratory at KUH and the Swedish Public Health Agency. RESULTS: We identified 357 infants with GPB-BSI, representing an incidence of 1.47/1000 live births (LB). Group B streptococcus (GBS) was the most common pathogen causing BSI in full-term infants and early-onset sepsis (EOS) (0.20/1000 LB), while coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were predominant in infants born very preterm and in late-onset sepsis (LOS) (0.79/1000 LB). There were no fatal GBS BSI cases, but 10.2% developed meningitis. The GPB case fatality rate was 9.5% and the sepsis fatality rate 2.8%. In GPB-BSI, 1/10 did not have an elevated C-reactive protein level. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) BSI increased during the study period, but no methicillin or vancomycin resistant strains were found. The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rate was highest in CoNS isolates. CONCLUSION: GPB-BSI was four times more common than Gram-negative BSI in neonates but resulted in lower mortality rate. GBS was the most common pathogen in full-term infants and in EOS. CoNS was the most common pathogen in LOS and infants born very preterm, and the AMR rate was high in these isolates. The increasing trend of S. aureus BSI indicates a need of further investigation.",

The principal elements of the most recent guidelines are summarized in this practice point. These elements include recognition of changes in clinical condition and vital signs, such as fever, tachycardia, and changes in peripheral perfusion, which should raise concern for sepsis; initial stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation; timely administration of empiric antimicrobial therapy; use of fluid boluses and vasoactive medications; and specific considerations in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as the use of corticosteroids for possible adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic-adrenal suppression. Two changes from previous guidelines are the concern for fluid overload, implying the need for clinical re-assessment after administration of each fluid bolus, and the removal of dopamine as the initial vasoactive agent for use in hypotensive paediatric patients, with recommendations for the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine as dictated by the clinical context.

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can be caused by a broad range of pathogens; however, bacterial infections represent the majority of sepsis cases. Up to 42% of sepsis presentations are culture negative, suggesting a non-bacterial cause. Despite this, diagnosis of viral sepsis remains very rare. Almost any virus can cause sepsis in vulnerable patients (e.g., neonates, infants, and other immunosuppressed groups). The prevalence of viral sepsis is not known, nor is there enough information to make an accurate estimate. The initial standard of care for all cases of sepsis, even those that are subsequently proven to be culture negative, is the immediate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the absence of definite diagnostic criteria for viral sepsis, or at least to exclude bacterial sepsis, this inevitably leads to unnecessary antimicrobial use, with associated consequences for antimicrobial resistance, effects on the host microbiome and excess healthcare costs. It is important to understand non-bacterial causes of sepsis so that inappropriate treatment can be minimised, and appropriate treatments can be developed to improve outcomes. In this review, we summarise what is known about viral sepsis, its most common causes, and how the immune responses to severe viral infections can contribute to sepsis. We also discuss strategies to improve our understanding of viral sepsis, and ways we can integrate this new information into effective treatment.",

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize the bacterial causes of paediatric bloodstream infections in LMICs and their resistance profile. METHODS: We searched Pubmed and Embase databases between January 1st 1990 and October 30th 2019, combining MeSH and free-text terms for \"sepsis\" and \"low-middle-income countries\" in children. Two reviewers screened articles and performed data extraction to identify studies investigating children (1\u2009month-18\u2009years), with at least one blood culture. The main outcomes of interests were the rate of positive blood cultures, the distribution of bacterial pathogens, the resistance patterns and the case-fatality rate. The proportions obtained from each study were pooled using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation, and a random-effect meta-analysis model was used. RESULTS: We identified 2403 eligible studies, 17 were included in the final review including 52,915 children (11 in Africa and 6 in Asia). The overall percentage of positive blood culture was 19.1% [95% CI: 12.0-27.5%]; 15.5% [8.4-24.4%] in Africa and 28.0% [13.2-45.8%] in Asia. A total of 4836 bacterial isolates were included in the studies; 2974 were Gram-negative (63.9% [52.2-74.9]) and 1858 were Gram-positive (35.8% [24.9-47.5]).

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Sepsis recognition is a clinical challenge in children. We aim to determine whether peripheral blood gene expression profiles are associated with pathogen type and sepsis severity in children with suspected sepsis. METHODS: This was a prospective pilot observational study in a tertiary pediatric emergency department with a convenience sample of children enrolled. Participants were older than 56 days and younger than 18 years, had suspected sepsis, and had not received broad-spectrum antibiotics in the previous 4 hours. Primary outcome was source pathogen, defined as confirmed bacterial source from sterile body fluid or confirmed viral source. Secondary outcome was sepsis severity, defined as maximum therapy required for shock reversal in the first 3 hospital days. We drew peripheral blood for ribonucleic acid isolation at the sepsis protocol activation, obtained gene expression measures with the GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array, and conducted differential expression analysis. RESULTS: We collected ribonucleic acid samples from a convenience sample of 122 children with suspected sepsis and 12 healthy controls. We compared the 66 children (54%) with confirmed bacterial or viral infection and found 558 differentially expressed genes, many related to interferon signaling or viral immunity. We did not find statistically significant gene expression differences in patients according to sepsis severity. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates feasibility of evaluating gene expression profiling data in children evaluated for sepsis in the pediatric emergency department setting. Our results suggest that gene expression profiling may facilitate identification of source pathogen in children with suspected sepsis, which could ultimately lead to improved tailoring of sepsis treatment and antimicrobial stewardship.",

Secondly, there may be genetic predispositions linked to the X chromosome, which could confer susceptibility to immune tolerance breakdown. Additionally, the phenomenon of fetal-maternal microchimerism, where cells from a fetus persist in the mother, may contribute to increased allogeneic cell traffic and a higher risk of developing autoimmunity in women.

        "abstract": "The effect of cytokines on non-traditional immunological targets under conditions of chronic inflammation is an ongoing subject of study. Fatigue is a symptom often associated with autoimmune diseases. Chronic inflammatory response and activated cell-mediated immunity are associated with cardiovascular myopathies which can be driven by muscle weakness and fatigue. Thus, we hypothesize that immune dysfunction-driven changes in myocyte mitochondria may play a critical role in fatigue-related pathogenesis. We show that persistent low-level expression of IFN-\u03b3 in designated IFN-\u03b3 AU-Rich Element deletion mice (ARE mice) under androgen exposure resulted in mitochondrial and metabolic deficiencies in myocytes from male or castrated ARE mice. Most notably, echocardiography unveiled that low ejection fraction in the left ventricle post-stress correlated with mitochondrial deficiencies, explaining how heart function decreases under stress. We report that inefficiencies and structural changes in mitochondria, with changes to expression of mitochondrial genes, are linked to male-biased fatigue and acute cardiomyopathy under stress. Our work highlights how male androgen hormone backgrounds and active autoimmunity reduce mitochondrial function and the ability to cope with stress and how pharmacological blockade of stress signal protects heart function. These studies provide new insight into the diverse actions of IFN-\u03b3 in fatigue, energy metabolism, and autoimmunity. \u00a9 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

This new disease entity was described as mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome (MPSPS). The name of the disease indicates that in addition to the typical symptoms of conventional MPS, patients develop other features such as congenital heart defects and kidney and hematopoietic system disorders. The symptoms are highly advanced, and patients usually do not survive past the second year of life. MPSPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a homozygous-specific mutation in the gene encoding the VPS33A protein. To date, it has been described in 41 patients. Patients with MPSPS exhibited excessive excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the urine and exceptionally high levels of heparan sulfate in the plasma, but the accumulation of substrates is not caused by a decrease in the activity of any lysosomal enzymes. Here, we discuss the pathomechanisms and symptoms of MPSPS, comparing them to those of MPS. Moreover, we asked the question whether MPSPS should be classified as a type of MPS or a separate disease, as contrary to 'classical' MPS types, despite GAG accumulation, no defects in lysosomal enzymes responsible for degradation of these compounds could be detected in MPSPS. The molecular mechanism of the appearance of GAG accumulation in MPSPS is suggested on the basis of results available in the literature.",

The existence of iron deposits in postmortem tissues of Parkinson's patients has been interpreted as evidence that iron plays a fundamental role in the degenerative process of the nigrostriatal system in this disease. The use of iron chelators has been successful in the treatment of diseases such as transfusion-dependent thalassemia and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. However, a clinical study with the iron chelator deferiprone in patients with Parkinson's disease has not shown positive effects but rather worsened clinical symptoms.

Specifically, we discussed randomized clinical trials in subjects with Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis bearing pathogenic gene mutations, and glucocerebrosidase-associated Parkinson's disease. Learning potential lessons to improve future therapeutic approaches is the aim of this review. Two long-term, controlled trials on three anti-\u03b2-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab and crenezumab) in subjects carrying Alzheimer's disease-linked mutated genes encoding for amyloid precursor protein or presenilin 1 or presenilin 2 failed to show cognitive or functional benefits. A major trial on tominersen, an antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce the production of the huntingtin protein in subjects with Huntington's disease, was prematurely interrupted because the drug failed to show higher efficacy than placebo and, at highest doses, led to worsened outcomes. A 28-week trial of tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide for superoxide dismutase 1 in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with superoxide dismutase 1 gene mutations failed to show significant beneficial effects but the 1-year open label extension of this study indicated better clinical and functional outcomes in the group with early tofersen therapy. A trial of venglustat, a potent and brain-penetrant glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, in Parkinson's disease subjects with heterozygous glucocerebrosidase gene mutations revealed worsened clinical and cognitive performance of patients on the enzyme inhibitor compared to placebo.

In the past years, myostatin inhibition sparked interest among the scientific community for its potential to enhance muscle growth and to reduce, or even prevent, muscle atrophy. These characteristics make it a promising target for the treatment of muscle atrophy in motor neuron diseases, namely, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which are rare neurological diseases, whereby the degeneration of motor neurons leads to progressive muscle loss and paralysis. These diseases carry a huge burden of morbidity and mortality but, despite this unfavorable scenario, several therapeutic advancements have been made in the past years. Indeed, a number of different curative therapies for SMA have been approved, leading to a revolution in the life expectancy and outcomes of SMA patients. Similarly, tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, is now undergoing clinical trial phase for use in ALS patients carrying the SOD1 mutation. However, these therapies are not able to completely halt or reverse progression of muscle damage. Recently, a trial evaluating apitegromab, a myostatin inhibitor, in SMA patients was started, following positive results from preclinical studies. In this context, myostatin inhibition could represent a useful strategy to tackle motor symptoms in these patients. The aim of this review is to describe the myostatin pathway and its role in motor neuron diseases, and to summarize and critically discuss preclinical and clinical studies of myostatin inhibitors in SMA and ALS.

        "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease affecting the movement and well-being of most elderly. The manifestations of Parkinson's disease often include resting tremor, stiffness, bradykinesia, and muscular rigidity. The typical hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the destruction of neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies in different compartments of the central nervous system. Due to various limitations to the currently available treatments, immunotherapies have emerged to be the new approach to Parkinson's disease treatment. This approach shows some positive outcomes on the efficacy by removing the aggregated species of alpha-synuclein, which is believed to be one of the causes of Parkinson's disease. In this review, an overview of how alpha-synuclein contributes to Parkinson's disease and the effects of a few new immunotherapeutic treatments, including BIIB054 (cinpanemab), MEDI1341, AFFITOPE, and PRX002 (prasinezumab) that are currently under clinical development, will be discussed.",

        "abstract": "Most autoimmune diseases occur significantly more frequently in women than men. This female preponderance for abnormal autoimmune function has largely gone unexplained. Many investigations have concentrated on the effects of female and male sex hormones on immune function, by suggesting that estrogens favor the antibody production-enhancing Th2 response and, by doing so, possibly, increase the risk towards abnormal autoimmune function. Others have suggested that women are genetically predisposed towards abnormal autoimmune function, possibly because the X chromosome may confer susceptibility towards tolerance breakdown. Recent developments have, however, opened new research avenues. The possible association between persistent fetal-maternal microchimerism and the development of autoimmune diseases has attracted special interest. Since, in analogy to allogeneic organ transplantation, fetal-maternal (and maternal-fetal) microchimerism may play an important role in the immunologic tolerance of the fetal semi-allograft, female preponderance for autoimmune diseases may be understood as a consequence of increased allogeneic cell traffic in females (in comparison to males), increased risk for long-term microchimerism and, therefore, as a consequence of the former two, the development of abnormal autoimmunity. Under an evolutionary view point the occurrence of autoimmune diseases, in general, can be seen as the price to be paid for successful reproduction. In view of increased exposure to cell traffic, women, of course, would be expected to pay a higher price, reflected in more autoimmunity.",

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal, progressive disease of the motor system. Most approved treatments have a modest effect on disease progression. Tofersen is a recently approved medication that acts by reducing a toxic protein found in a particular form of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This is an overview of the published clinical data for tofersen as well as some background information about tofersen and other treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.What were the results? Treatment with tofersen reduced levels of the target protein and markers of nervous system damage. In longer follow-up, patients treated with tofersen showed less disease progression.What do the results of the study mean? Treatment with tofersen likely slows progression in this form of inherited ALS, though longer duration studies would likely be needed to demonstrate this effect.",

However, while clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been conducted in recent years, the results have not always been favorable. The results from a Phase III trial of the antisense oligonucleotide, that is, tofersen, which targets SOD1 mRNA, showed decreased levels of cerebrospinal fluid SOD1 and plasma neurofilament light chain but no improvements in primary clinical endpoint. Moreover, case reports pertaining to patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis carrying FUS and C9orf72 mutations who received antisense oligonucleotide-based treatments have demonstrated a notable reduction in the targeted protein (thus providing the proof of mechanism) but with no discernible clinical benefits. There are several possible reasons why antisense oligonucleotides knockdown fails to achieve proof of concept, which need to be addressed: on-target adverse effects resulting from the loss of function of target gene and irreversible neuronal death cascade due to toxic protein accumulation, among other factors.

        "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare disability causing female-oriented pediatric neurodevelopmental unmet medical need. RTT was recognized in 1966. However, over the past 56 years, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has authorized no effective treatment for RTT. Recently, Trofinetide was approved by the USFDA on 10 March 2023 as the first RTT treatment. This article underlines the pharmaceutical advancement, patent literature, and prospects of Trofinetide. The data for this study were gathered from the PubMed database, authentic websites (Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Neuren Pharmaceuticals, and USFDA), and free patent databases. Trofinetide was first disclosed by Neuren Pharmaceuticals in 2000 as a methyl group containing analog of the naturally occurring neuroprotective tripeptide called glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE). The joint efforts of Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Neuren Pharmaceuticals have developed Trofinetide. The mechanism of action of Trofinetide is not yet well established. However, it is supposed to improve neuronal morphology and synaptic functioning. The patent literature revealed a handful of inventions related to Trofinetide, providing excellent and unexplored broad research possibilities with Trofinetide. The development of innovative Trofinetide-based molecules, combinations of Trofinetide, patient-compliant drug formulations, and precise MECP2-mutation-related personalized medicines are foreseeable. Trofinetide is in clinical trials for some neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including treating Fragile X syndrome (FXS). It is expected that Trofinetide may be approved for treating FXS in the future. The USFDA-approval of Trofinetide is one of the important milestones for RTT therapy and is the beginning of a new era for the therapy of RTT, FXS, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), brain injury, stroke, and other NDDs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects adults, characterized by muscle weakness resulting from the specific death of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. The pathogenesis of ALS is associated with the accumulation of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) proteins and neurofilaments in motor neurons, highlighting the critical need for disease-modifying treatments. Current therapies, such as riluzole and edaravone, provide only symptomatic relief. Recently, tofersen gained approval from the US FDA under the brand name Qalsody as the first and only gene therapy for ALS, addressing a significant pathological aspect of the disease. METHODS: We carried out a literature survey using PubMed, Scopus, National Institutes of Health, and Biogen for articles published in the English language concerned with \"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\", pathophysiology, current treatment, treatment under clinical trial, and the newly approved drug \"tofersen\" and its detailed summary. RESULTS: A comprehensive review of the literature on the pathophysiology, available treatment, and newly approved drug for this condition revealed convincing evidence that we are now able to better monitor and treat ALS. CONCLUSIONS: Although treatment of ALS is difficult, the newly approved drug tofersen has emerged as a potential therapy to slow down the progression of ALS by targeting SOD1 mRNA, representing a significant advancement in the treatment of ALS.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method. The model has better diagnostic performance compared with conventional inflammatory indicators such as CRP, Hb, NEU%, and PCT.",

Specifically, we discussed randomized clinical trials in subjects with Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis bearing pathogenic gene mutations, and glucocerebrosidase-associated Parkinson's disease. Learning potential lessons to improve future therapeutic approaches is the aim of this review. Two long-term, controlled trials on three anti-\u03b2-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab and crenezumab) in subjects carrying Alzheimer's disease-linked mutated genes encoding for amyloid precursor protein or presenilin 1 or presenilin 2 failed to show cognitive or functional benefits. A major trial on tominersen, an antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce the production of the huntingtin protein in subjects with Huntington's disease, was prematurely interrupted because the drug failed to show higher efficacy than placebo and, at highest doses, led to worsened outcomes. A 28-week trial of tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide for superoxide dismutase 1 in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with superoxide dismutase 1 gene mutations failed to show significant beneficial effects but the 1-year open label extension of this study indicated better clinical and functional outcomes in the group with early tofersen therapy. A trial of venglustat, a potent and brain-penetrant glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, in Parkinson's disease subjects with heterozygous glucocerebrosidase gene mutations revealed worsened clinical and cognitive performance of patients on the enzyme inhibitor compared to placebo. We concluded that clinical trials in neurodegenerative diseases with a genetic basis should test monoclonal antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides or gene editing directed against the mutated enzyme or the mutated substrate without dramatically affecting physiological wild-type variants.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Focused ultrasound (FUS) shows promise for enhancing drug delivery to the brain by temporarily opening the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and it is increasingly used in the clinical setting to treat brain tumours. It remains however unclear whether FUS is being introduced in an ethically and methodologically sound manner. The IDEAL-D framework for the introduction of surgical innovations and the SYRCLE and ROBINS-I tools for assessing the risk of bias in animal studies and non-randomized trials, respectively, provide a comprehensive evaluation for this. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature review on FUS in neuro-oncology was conducted. Subsequently, the included studies were evaluated using the IDEAL-D framework, SYRCLE, and ROBINS-I tools. RESULTS: In total, 19 published studies and 12 registered trials were identified. FUS demonstrated successful BBB disruption, increased drug delivery, and improved survival rates. However, the SYRCLE analysis revealed a high risk of bias in animal studies, while the ROBINS-I analysis found that most human studies had a high risk of bias due to a lack of blinding and heterogeneous samples. Of the 15 pre-clinical stage 0 studies, only six had formal ethical approval, and only five followed animal care policies. Both stage 1 studies and stage 1/2a studies failed to provide information on patient data confidentiality. Overall, no animal or human study reached the IDEAL-D stage endpoint. CONCLUSION: FUS holds promise for enhancing drug delivery to the brain, but its development and implementation must adhere to rigorous safety standards using the established ethical and methodological frameworks. The complementary use of IDEAL-D, SYRCLE, and ROBINS-I tools indicates a high risk of bias and ethical limitations in both animal and human studies, highlighting the need for further improvements in study design for a safe implementation of FUS in neuro-oncology.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral palsy is a neurodevelopmental disease characterized by postural, motor, and cognitive disorders, being one of the main causes of physical and intellectual disability in childhood. To minimize functional impairments, the use of resveratrol as a therapeutic strategy is highlighted due to its neuroprotective and antioxidant effects in different regions of the brain. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of neonatal treatment with resveratrol on postural development, motor function, oxidative balance, and mitochondrial biogenesis in the brain of rats submitted to a cerebral palsy model. Neonatal treatment with resveratrol attenuated deficits in somatic growth, postural development, and muscle strength in rats submitted to cerebral palsy. Related to oxidative balance, resveratrol in cerebral palsy decreased the levels of MDA and carbonyls. Related to mitochondrial biogenesis, was observed in animals with cerebral palsy treated with resveratrol, an increase in mRNA levels of TFAM, in association with the increase of citrate synthase activity. The data demonstrated a promising effect of neonatal resveratrol treatment, improving postural and muscle deficits induced by cerebral palsy. These findings were associated with improvements in oxidative balance and mitochondrial biogenesis in the brain of rats submitted to cerebral palsy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in incidence, etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture confirmed infections in hospitalized infants in a large tertiary neonatal unit in South Africa. METHODS: Single-center, retrospective review of laboratory records of bacteria and fungi, and their susceptibility profiles, isolated from blood and CSF of infants hospitalized in the neonatal unit at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa, from 1st January 2010 to 31st December 2019. Laboratory data on isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were collected. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Corynebacteria and Bacillus spp. were excluded. Patient-level clinical and laboratory data were not available. RESULTS: There were 8,319 significant isolates, giving an infection rate of 14.3/1000 patient-days. Infection rates increased from 12.0 to 15.7/1000 patient-days (estimated average yearly change 0.6[95%CI, 0.5-0.7];p = <0.001). Gram-negative infection rates increased from 4.3 to 10.8/1000 patient-days (estimated average yearly change 0.7[95%CI,0.6-0.8];p = <0.001). The 2 most commonly isolated Gram-negative organisms were Acinetobacter baumannii (44%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (39%). Carbapenem resistance was seen in 31% of all Gram-negatives and increased over time (estimated average yearly change 4.8%[95%CI,4.2%-5.3%];p<0.001). Gram-positive infection rates decreased (estimated average yearly change -0.1[95%CI,-0.2- -0.05];p = <0.001). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram-positive isolated. Rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus decreased from 91% to 55%(estimated average yearly change -2.8%[95%CI,-3.5%-2%],p< 0.001). Rates of fungal isolates decreased (estimated average yearly change -0.06[95%CI,-0.1 --0.02]);p = 0.007). Candida parapsilosis (52%) and Candida albicans (35%) were the most common fungi isolated. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a marked overall increase in rates of blood and/or CSF infections, with an absolute increase in Gram-negative infections observed, replacing Gram-positive and fungal pathogens. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase Gram-negative isolates are being replaced by carbapenem resistance, with around one third of all significant Gram-negative isolates now carbapenem resistant. Research into hospital based novel treatment and prevention interventions for neonatal sepsis should be urgently prioritized.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Previous studies applying Sepsis-3 criteria to children were based on retrospective analyses of PICU cohorts. We aimed to compare organ dysfunction criteria in children with blood culture-proven sepsis, including emergency department, PICU, and ward patients, and to assess relevance of organ dysfunctions for mortality prediction. DESIGN: We have carried out a nonprespecified, secondary analysis of a prospective dataset collected from September 2011 to December 2015. SETTING: Emergency departments, wards, and PICUs in 10 tertiary children's hospitals in Switzerland. PATIENTS: Children younger than 17 years old with blood culture-proven sepsis. We excluded preterm infants and term infants younger than 7 days old. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC), Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2), pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA), and Pediatric Organ Dysfunction Information Update Mandate (PODIUM) scores, measured at blood culture sampling, to predict 30-day mortality. We analyzed 877 sepsis episodes in 807 children, with a 30-day mortality of 4.3%. Percentage with organ dysfunction ranged from 32.7% (IPSCC) to 55.3% (pSOFA). In adjusted analyses, the accuracy for identification of 30-day mortality was area under the curve (AUC) 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82-0.92) for IPSCC, 0.83 (0.76-0.89) for PELOD-2, 0.85 (0.78-0.92) for pSOFA, and 0.85 (0.78-0.91) for PODIUM. When restricting scores to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction, the adjusted AUC was 0.89 (0.84-0.94) for IPSCC, 0.85 (0.79-0.91) for PELOD-2, 0.87 (0.81-0.93) for pSOFA, and 0.88 (0.83-0.93) for PODIUM. CONCLUSIONS: IPSCC, PELOD-2, pSOFA, and PODIUM performed similarly to predict 30-day mortality. Simplified scores restricted to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction yielded comparable performance.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition, occurring when an infectious agent invades the body, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2\u03bcg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin. Early detection of bacteria followed by antimicrobial susceptibility test can help by selection of appropriate antibiotic and prevent spread of infection.",

        "abstract": "Human livelihood highly depends on applying different sources of energy whose utilization is associated with air pollution. On the other hand, air pollution may be associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Unlike other environmental causes of cancer (e.g., irradiation), air pollution cannot efficiently be controlled by geographical borders, regulations, and policies. The unavoidable exposure to air pollution can modify cancer incidence and mortality. GBM treatment with chemotherapy or even its surgical removal has proven insufficient (100% recurrence rate; patient's survival mean of 15 months; 90% fatality within five years) due to glioma infiltrative and migratory capacities. Given the barrage of attention and research investments currently plowed into next-generation cancer therapy, oncolytic viruses are perhaps the most vigorously pursued. Provision of an insight into the current state of the research and future direction is essential for stimulating new ideas with the potentials of filling research gaps. This review manuscript aims to overview types of brain cancer, their burden, and different causative agents. It also describes why air pollution is becoming a concerning factor. The different opinions on the association of air pollution with brain cancer are reviewed. It tries to address the significant controversy in this field by hypothesizing the air-pollution-brain-cancer association via inflammation and atopic conditions. The last section of this review deals with the oncolytic viruses, which have been used in, or are still under clinical trials for GBM treatment. Engineered adenoviruses (i.e., DNX-2401, DNX-2440, CRAd8-S-pk7 loaded Neural stem cells), herpes simplex virus type 1 (i.e., HSV-1 C134, HSV-1 rQNestin34.5v.2, HSV-1 G207, HSV-1 M032), measles virus (i.e., MV-CEA), parvovirus (i.e., ParvOryx), poliovirus (i.e., Poliovirus PVSRIPO), reovirus (i.e., pelareorep), moloney murine leukemia virus (i.e., Toca 511 vector), and vaccinia virus (i.e., vaccinia virus TG6002) as possible life-changing alleviations for GBM have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first review that comprehensively discusses both (i) the negative/positive association of air pollution with GBM; and (ii) the application of oncolytic viruses for GBM, including the most recent advances and clinical trials. It is also the first review that addresses the controversies over air pollution and brain cancer association. We believe that the article will significantly appeal to a broad readership of virologists, oncologists, neurologists, environmentalists, and those who work in the field of (bio)energy. Policymakers may also use it to establish better health policies and regulations about air pollution and (bio)fuels exploration, production, and consumption.",

        "abstract": "Unintended pregnancy is a global public health problem. Despite a variety of female contraceptive options, male contraceptive options are limited to the condom and vasectomy. Condoms have high failure rates and surgical vasectomy is not reliably reversible. There is a global need and desire for novel male contraceptive methods. Hormonal methods have progressed the furthest in clinical development and androgen plus progestin formulations hold promise as a marketable, reversible male contraceptive over the next decade. Investigators have tested androgen plus progestin approaches using oral, transdermal, subdermal, and injectable drug formulations and demonstrated the short-term safety and reversibility of hormonal male contraception. The most commonly reported side effects associated with hormonal male contraception include weight gain, acne, slight suppression of serum high-density cholesterol, mood changes, and changes in libido. Efficacy trials of hormonal male contraceptives have demonstrated contraceptive efficacy rates greater than that of condoms. Although there has been less progression in the development of nonhormonal male contraceptives, potentially reversible vaso-occlusive methods are currently in clinical trials in some countries. Various studies have confirmed both men and women's desire for novel male contraceptives. Barriers to development include an absence of investment from pharmaceutical companies, concerns regarding side effects and spermatogenic rebound with hormonal methods, and lack of clear reversibility and proven effectiveness of nonhormonal methods. The ultimate availability of male contraceptives could have an important impact on decreasing global unintended pregnancy rates (currently 40% of all pregnancies) and will be a step towards reproductive justice and greater equity in family planning.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. There is a paucity of data on the criteria used to define sepsis and septic shock and predict mortality. Schlapbach et al. published Phoenix criteria to define sepsis in JAMA in 2024. Previously, paediatricians have used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, but these criteria lack sensitivity and specificity. This group recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Though included in the 8-point criteria, important criteria like renal and liver are missing from the main criteria. We remain worried about the way these criteria got excluded from the main criteria. Therefore, in this brief report, whilst commending the authors for this stelar task, we highlight the main pitfalls in these criteria especially the renal, neurologic, and liver criteria. These criteria have been shown to be independently associated with outcomes, and we recommend that in the future iterations of the criteria, renal and liver criteria should be defined according to latest definitions and the task force consider utilizing latest criteria for each organ system involved within the formulated criteria. CONCLUSION: \u00a0In conclusion, Phoenix criteria are a step in the right direction to define life-threatening organ dysfunction in sepsis, but clinicians need to be mindful that diagnosis/treatment of less severe sepsis should not be delayed if these criteria are not met. Therefore, local early detection and management tools for sepsis should be followed. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 There has always been a quest for a definition for pediatric sepsis. There are limitations to the previous pediatric sepsis criteria which were published in 2005 by the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC). IPSCC defines sepsis as a suspected or confirmed infection in the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). These new Phoenix Pediatric Sepsis (PPS) criteria for sepsis and septic shock are intended to identify children with life-threatening organ dysfunction due to infection, and the score was developed based on a very large pediatric dataset. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022 Though the intention of Phoenix criteria is to help identify children with life threatening organ dysfunction, unfortunately the crietria will miss signs of early sepis. In this manuscript, we point out some of the drawbacks of these criteria which need to be borne in mind while applying these criteria.",

The data for this study were gathered from the PubMed database, authentic websites (Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Neuren Pharmaceuticals, and USFDA), and free patent databases. Trofinetide was first disclosed by Neuren Pharmaceuticals in 2000 as a methyl group containing analog of the naturally occurring neuroprotective tripeptide called glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE). The joint efforts of Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Neuren Pharmaceuticals have developed Trofinetide. The mechanism of action of Trofinetide is not yet well established. However, it is supposed to improve neuronal morphology and synaptic functioning. The patent literature revealed a handful of inventions related to Trofinetide, providing excellent and unexplored broad research possibilities with Trofinetide. The development of innovative Trofinetide-based molecules, combinations of Trofinetide, patient-compliant drug formulations, and precise MECP2-mutation-related personalized medicines are foreseeable. Trofinetide is in clinical trials for some neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including treating Fragile X syndrome (FXS). It is expected that Trofinetide may be approved for treating FXS in the future. The USFDA-approval of Trofinetide is one of the important milestones for RTT therapy and is the beginning of a new era for the therapy of RTT, FXS, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), brain injury, stroke, and other NDDs.",

        "abstract": "Cell therapies are an emergent treatment for cerebral palsy (CP) with promising evidence demonstrating efficacy for improving gross motor function. However, families value improvements in a range of domains following intervention and the non-motor symptoms, comorbidities and complications of CP can potentially be targeted by cell therapies. We conducted a scoping review to describe all outcomes that have been reported in cell therapy studies for CP to date, and to examine what instruments were used to capture these. Through a systematic search we identified 54 studies comprising 2066 participants that were treated with a range of cell therapy interventions. We categorized the reported 53 unique outcome instruments and additional descriptive measures into 10 categories and 12 sub-categories. Movement and Posture was the most frequently reported outcome category, followed by Safety, however Quality of Life, and various prevalent comorbidities and complications of CP were infrequently reported. Notably, many outcome instruments used do not have evaluative properties and thus are not suitable for measuring change following intervention. We provide a number of recommendations to ensure that future trials generate high-quality outcome data that is aligned with the priorities of the CP community.",

        "abstract": "Current research on personality disorders strives to identify key behavioural and cognitive facets of patient functioning, to unravel the underlying root causes and maintenance mechanisms. This process often involves the application of social paradigms - however, these often only include momentary affective depictions rather than unfolding interactions. This constitutes a limitation in our capacity to probe core symptoms, and leaves potential findings uncovered which could help those who are in close relationships with affected individuals. Here, we deployed a novel task in which subjects interact with four unknown virtual partners in a turn-taking paradigm akin to a dance, and report on their experience with each. The virtual partners embody four combinations of low/high expressivity of positive/negative mood. Higher scores on our symptomatic measures of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were all linked to a general negative appraisal of all the interpersonal experiences. Moreover, the negative appraisal of the partner who displayed a high negative/low positive mood was tied with attachment anxiety and BPD symptoms. The extent to which subjects felt responsible for causing partners' distress was most strongly linked to attachment anxiety. Finally, we provide a fully-fledged exploration of move-by-move action latencies and click distances from partners. This analysis underscored slower movement initiation from anxiously attached individuals throughout all virtual interactions. In summary, we describe a novel paradigm for second-person neuroscience, which allowed both the replication of established results and the capture of new behavioural signatures associated with attachment anxiety, and discuss its limitations.",

        "abstract": "The effect of cytokines on non-traditional immunological targets under conditions of chronic inflammation is an ongoing subject of study. Fatigue is a symptom often associated with autoimmune diseases. Chronic inflammatory response and activated cell-mediated immunity are associated with cardiovascular myopathies which can be driven by muscle weakness and fatigue. Thus, we hypothesize that immune dysfunction-driven changes in myocyte mitochondria may play a critical role in fatigue-related pathogenesis. We show that persistent low-level expression of IFN-\u03b3 in designated IFN-\u03b3 AU-Rich Element deletion mice (ARE mice) under androgen exposure resulted in mitochondrial and metabolic deficiencies in myocytes from male or castrated ARE mice. Most notably, echocardiography unveiled that low ejection fraction in the left ventricle post-stress correlated with mitochondrial deficiencies, explaining how heart function decreases under stress. We report that inefficiencies and structural changes in mitochondria, with changes to expression of mitochondrial genes, are linked to male-biased fatigue and acute cardiomyopathy under stress. Our work highlights how male androgen hormone backgrounds and active autoimmunity reduce mitochondrial function and the ability to cope with stress and how pharmacological blockade of stress signal protects heart function. These studies provide new insight into the diverse actions of IFN-\u03b3 in fatigue, energy metabolism, and autoimmunity. \u00a9 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Growing evidence suggests B cells to play a crucial role in its pathogenesis and progression. Over the last decades, monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against the surface protein CD20 have been intensively studied as a B cell targeting therapy in relapsing MS (RMS) as well as primary progressive MS (PPMS). Pivotal studies on anti-CD20 therapy in RMS showed remarkable clinical and radiological effects, especially on acute inflammation and relapse biology. These results paved the way for further research on the implication of B cells in the pathogenesis of MS. Besides controlling relapse development in RMS, ocrelizumab (OCR) also showed clinical benefits in patients with PPMS and became the first approved drug for this disease course. In this review, we provide an overview of the current anti-CD20 mabs used or tested for the treatment of MS-namely rituximab (RTX), OCR, ofatumumab (OFA), and ublituximab (UB). Besides their effectiveness, we also discuss possible limitations and safety concerns especially in regard to long-term treatment, both for this class of drugs overall as well as for each anti-CD20 mab individually. Additionally, we elucidate to what extent anti-CD20 therapy may alter the function of other immune cells, both directly or indirectly.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method. The model has better diagnostic performance compared with conventional inflammatory indicators such as CRP, Hb, NEU%, and PCT.",

CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in the treatment of R/R childhood B-ALL, although the majority of reports have been in noninfant patients. Barriers to the successful implementation of CAR T-cell therapy in infant B-ALL include challenges related to apheresis, product manufacturing, and disease-specific considerations such as lineage switch.

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AIMS: The targeting of solid cancers with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells faces many technological hurdles, including selection of optimal target antigens. Promising pre-clinical and clinical data of CAR T-cell activity have emerged from targeting surface antigens such as GD2 and B7H3 in childhood cancer neuroblastoma. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is expressed in a majority of neuroblastomas at low antigen density but is largely absent from healthy tissues. METHODS: To explore an alternate target antigen for neuroblastoma CAR T-cell therapy, the authors generated and screened a single-chain variable fragment library targeting ALK extracellular domain to make a panel of new anti-ALK CAR T-cell constructs. RESULTS: A lead novel CAR T-cell construct was capable of specific cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma cells expressing low levels of ALK, but with only weak cytokine and proliferative T-cell responses. To explore strategies for amplifying ALK CAR T cells, the authors generated a co-CAR approach in which T cells received signal 1 from a first-generation ALK construct and signal 2 from anti-B7H3 or GD2 chimeric co-stimulatory receptors. The co-CAR approach successfully demonstrated the ability to avoid targeting single-antigen-positive targets as a strategy for mitigating on-target off-tumor toxicity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dose-escalation phase I study with 3+3 cohorts, dosing 107 to 1 \u00d7 1011 viral particles (vp) in 20 patients. Besides clinical parameters, adverse events, and radiologic findings, blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain interstitial fluid, and excreta were sampled over time and analyzed for presence of immune response, viral replication, distribution, and shedding. RESULTS: Of 20 enrolled patients, 19 received the oncolytic adenovirus Delta24-RGD, which was found to be safe and feasible. Four patients demonstrated tumor response on MRI, one with complete regression and still alive after 8 years. Most serious adverse events were attributed to increased intracranial pressure caused by either an inflammatory reaction responding to steroid treatment or viral meningitis being transient and self-limiting. Often viral DNA concentrations in CSF increased over time, peaking after 2 to 4 weeks and remaining up to 3 months. Concomitantly Th1- and Th2-associated cytokine levels and numbers of CD3+ T and natural killer cells increased. Posttreatment tumor specimens revealed increased numbers of macrophages and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. No evidence of viral shedding in excreta was observed. CONCLUSIONS: CED of Delta24-RGD not only in the tumor but also in surrounding brain is safe, induces a local inflammatory reaction, and shows promising clinical responses.",

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) is a relatively new treatment for pediatric leukemia and has been the focus of recent advancements. CAR is manufactured to express T cells through various ways such as using retroviruses, transposons and transposase, electroporation, and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Together, it provides flexibility since it recognizes proteins without the need of antigen processing and presentation, can recognize carbohydrates and lipids, and it has been proven to be cost-effective. Despite these benefits however, problems faced by this therapy include unrecognized tumor proteins possibly escaping the system, CAR T cell expression being transient, and the therapy being one of the most expensive cancer drug ever approved. As a result, recent progress has been ongoing where researchers have combined CAR-T cells with natural killer (NK) cells and different cytokines to maximize its efficacy and potency while limiting potential risks such as cytokine release syndrome. Consequently, these cells gained the ability to be universal-being able to be used to treat multiple patients, maintain viability for a longer period, and prevent relapse.",

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has become the standard of care for children and young adults with relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and it is a highly promising therapy under investigation for adults with relapsed disease. Despite having potentially life-threatening toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, the benefits of CAR T-cell therapy far outweigh these risks, particularly as increased experience and improved supportive care measures are mitigating these toxicities. CAR T cells can result in complete remission for significant proportion of patients with relapsed and refractory B-ALL and permit them to proceed to potentially curative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). CAR T cells may also be curative by themselves. Herein lie the greatest challenges and questions for clinical investigators, specifically, how are CAR T cells best employed and how do we overcome mechanisms of resistance to them? The primary clinical question is the timing and even the necessity of allo-HSCT. Relative to resistance, we know that target antigen loss, specifically CD19, is a major contributor to resistance. However, current investigations of alternative targets, such CD22, and CAR T cells expressing dual targeting antigen receptors have demonstrated encouraging initial results and provide a high degree of optimism that the efficacy and the broader application of CAR T-cell therapy will gradually increase in B-ALL. That optimism is not as high and the challenges are increased for the application of CAR T cells in T-cell leukemias and acute myeloid leukemia due to the relative lack of suitable leukemia surface targets that are not also expressed on normal hematopoietic progenitors. Despite these significant challenges, considerable research is being conducted into the development of CAR T cells for these diseases utilizing unique technologies, which may be applicable to other diseases.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Male contraception with exogenously administered hormones suppresses both luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone leading to low intratesticular testosterone concentration. This results in reversible suppression of spermatogenesis and marked decrease in sperm output in the ejaculate and preventing pregnancy in the female partner. PRIOR STUDIES: Studies of testosterone administered alone or in combination of another gonadotropin suppressive agent such as a progestin or gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog showed decisively that the exogenous hormone administrations are effective in suppressing sperm output with few adverse events that are not anticipated. In contraceptive efficacy studies, testosterone alone or combined with a progestin are as effective in preventing pregnancies as female contraceptive methods. CONCLUSION: Hormone combinations for male contraception are in late-phase clinical trials and hold the promise of being the new, reversible contraception method for men in over half a century.

        "title": "Male contraception: narrative review of ongoing research.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the release of the combined oral contraceptive pill in 1960, women have shouldered the burden of contraception and family planning. Over 60 years later, this is still the case as the only practical, effective contraceptive options available to men are condoms and vasectomy. However, there are now a variety of promising hormonal and non-hormonal male contraceptive options being studied. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide clinicians and laypeople with focused, up-to-date descriptions of novel strategies and targets for male contraception. We include a cautiously optimistic discussion of benefits and potential drawbacks, highlighting several methods in preclinical and clinical stages of development. RESULTS: As of June 2023, two hormonal male contraceptive methods are undergoing phase II clinical trials for safety and efficacy. A large-scale, international phase IIb trial investigating efficacy of transdermal segesterone acetate (Nestorone) plus testosterone gel has enrolled over 460 couples with completion estimated for late 2024. A second hormonal method, dimethandrolone undecanoate, is in two clinical trials focusing on safety, pharmacodynamics, suppression of spermatogenesis and hormones; the first of these two is estimated for completion in December 2024. There are also several non-hormonal methods with strong potential in preclinical stages of development. CONCLUSIONS: There exist several hurdles to novel male contraception. Therapeutic development takes decades of time, meticulous work, and financial investment, but with so many strong candidates it is our hope that there will soon be several safe, effective, and reversible contraceptive options available to male patients. R\u00e9SUM\u00e9: CONTEXTE: Depuis la sortie de la pilule contraceptive orale combin\u00e9e en 1960, les femmes ont assum\u00e9 le fardeau de la contraception et de la planification familiale. Plus de 60 ans plus tard, c\u2019est toujours le cas, car les seules options contraceptives pratiques et efficaces disponibles pour les hommes sont les pr\u00e9servatifs et la vasectomie. Cependant, il existe maintenant une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019options contraceptives masculines hormonales et non hormonales prometteuses qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude. Le but de cette revue narrative est de fournir aux cliniciens et aux profanes des descriptions cibl\u00e9es et \u00e0 jour de nouvelles strat\u00e9gies et cibles pour la contraception masculine. Nous incluons une discussion prudemment optimiste sur les avantages et les inconv\u00e9nients potentiels, en soulignant plusieurs m\u00e9thodes aux stades pr\u00e9cliniques et cliniques du d\u00e9veloppement. R\u00e9SULTATS: En juin 2023, deux m\u00e9thodes contraceptives masculines hormonales faisaient l\u2019objet d\u2019essais cliniques de phase II pour leur innocuit\u00e9 et leur efficacit\u00e9.

        "title": "Digitally augmented, parent-led CBT versus treatment as usual for child anxiety problems in child mental health services in England and Northern Ireland: a pragmatic, non-inferiority, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety problems are common in children, yet few affected children access evidence-based treatment. Digitally augmented psychological therapies bring potential to increase availability of effective help for children with mental health problems. This study aimed to establish whether therapist-supported, digitally augmented, parent-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could increase the efficiency of treatment without compromising clinical effectiveness and acceptability. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, unblinded, two-arm, multisite, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapist-supported, parent-led CBT using the Online Support and Intervention (OSI) for child anxiety platform compared with treatment as usual for child (aged 5-12 years) anxiety problems in 34 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in England and Northern Ireland. We examined acceptability of OSI plus therapist support via qualitative interviews. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OSI plus therapist support or treatment as usual, minimised by child age, gender, service type, and baseline child anxiety interference. Outcomes were assessed at week 14 and week 26 after randomisation. The primary clinical outcome was parent-reported interference caused by child anxiety at week 26 assessment, using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale-parent report (CAIS-P). The primary measure of health economic effect was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Outcome analyses were conducted blind in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with a standardised non-inferiority margin of 0\u00b733 for clinical analyses. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, 12890382. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2020, and Aug 3, 2022, 706 families (706 children and their parents or carers) were referred to the study information. 444 families were enrolled. Parents reported 255 (58%) child participants' gender to be female, 184 (41%) male, three (<1%) other, and one (<1%) preferred not to report their child's gender. 400 (90%) children were White and the mean age was 9\u00b720 years (SD 1\u00b779). 85% of families for whom clinicians provided information in the treatment as usual group received CBT. OSI plus therapist support was non-inferior for parent-reported anxiety interference on the CAIS-P (SMD 0\u00b701, 95% CI -0\u00b715 to 0\u00b717; p<0\u00b70001) and all secondary outcomes. The mean difference in QALYs across trial arms approximated to zero, and OSI plus therapist support was associated with lower costs than treatment as usual. OSI plus therapist support was likely to be cost effective under certain scenarios, but uncertainty was high. OSI plus therapist support acceptability was good. No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Digitally augmented intervention brought promising savings without compromising outcomes and as such presents a valuable tool for increasing access to psychological therapies and meeting the demand for treatment of child anxiety problems.

        "abstract": "Unintended pregnancy is a global public health problem. Despite a variety of female contraceptive options, male contraceptive options are limited to the condom and vasectomy. Condoms have high failure rates and surgical vasectomy is not reliably reversible. There is a global need and desire for novel male contraceptive methods. Hormonal methods have progressed the furthest in clinical development and androgen plus progestin formulations hold promise as a marketable, reversible male contraceptive over the next decade. Investigators have tested androgen plus progestin approaches using oral, transdermal, subdermal, and injectable drug formulations and demonstrated the short-term safety and reversibility of hormonal male contraception. The most commonly reported side effects associated with hormonal male contraception include weight gain, acne, slight suppression of serum high-density cholesterol, mood changes, and changes in libido. Efficacy trials of hormonal male contraceptives have demonstrated contraceptive efficacy rates greater than that of condoms. Although there has been less progression in the development of nonhormonal male contraceptives, potentially reversible vaso-occlusive methods are currently in clinical trials in some countries. Various studies have confirmed both men and women's desire for novel male contraceptives. Barriers to development include an absence of investment from pharmaceutical companies, concerns regarding side effects and spermatogenic rebound with hormonal methods, and lack of clear reversibility and proven effectiveness of nonhormonal methods. The ultimate availability of male contraceptives could have an important impact on decreasing global unintended pregnancy rates (currently 40% of all pregnancies) and will be a step towards reproductive justice and greater equity in family planning.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine men's satisfaction with and acceptability of a once-daily, oral regimen of dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU) versus placebo when used for 28\u00a0days. STUDY DESIGN: After a Phase I double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating trial of oral DMAU for 28-days, 57 healthy male volunteers completed a survey assessing their experience and satisfaction with the regimen. In the trial, participants were randomized to receive up to 4 DMAU capsules daily versus placebo and instructed to ingest them within 30\u00a0min of consuming a high fat meal. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were performed, followed by a 6-week recovery phase. Participants were counseled that they could not rely on the drug for contraception. RESULTS: Fifty-seven participants were offered acceptability surveys (39 DMAU, 18 placebo). Most respondents, 80% (45/56), reported satisfaction with the method; 77% (44/57) would recommend it. 54% (31/57), reported that, if available, they would use the method as their primary contraceptive. More respondents reported satisfaction with active DMAU than placebo (87% vs. 67%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Most respondents, 91% (52/57), reported no difficulty with having to take up to 4 pills within 30\u00a0min of ingesting a high-fat meal. CONCLUSION: Most participants reported that the study method, daily oral DMAU or placebo, was satisfactory and acceptable. Having to take the drug after a high-fat meal did not detract from acceptability. IMPLICATIONS: Most participants in a 4-week trial of daily DMAU capsules would recommend and use the method. High satisfaction among DMAU and placebo groups affirms acceptability of a daily male contraceptive pill, warranting further study of oral DMAU.",

        "abstract": "The present study examined genetic, prenatal, and postnatal environmental pathways in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and depressive symptoms from parents to early adolescents (when these symptoms start to increase), while considering timing effects of exposure to parent anxiety and depressive symptoms postnatally. The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

        "abstract": "The effect of cytokines on non-traditional immunological targets under conditions of chronic inflammation is an ongoing subject of study. Fatigue is a symptom often associated with autoimmune diseases. Chronic inflammatory response and activated cell-mediated immunity are associated with cardiovascular myopathies which can be driven by muscle weakness and fatigue. Thus, we hypothesize that immune dysfunction-driven changes in myocyte mitochondria may play a critical role in fatigue-related pathogenesis. We show that persistent low-level expression of IFN-\u03b3 in designated IFN-\u03b3 AU-Rich Element deletion mice (ARE mice) under androgen exposure resulted in mitochondrial and metabolic deficiencies in myocytes from male or castrated ARE mice. Most notably, echocardiography unveiled that low ejection fraction in the left ventricle post-stress correlated with mitochondrial deficiencies, explaining how heart function decreases under stress. We report that inefficiencies and structural changes in mitochondria, with changes to expression of mitochondrial genes, are linked to male-biased fatigue and acute cardiomyopathy under stress. Our work highlights how male androgen hormone backgrounds and active autoimmunity reduce mitochondrial function and the ability to cope with stress and how pharmacological blockade of stress signal protects heart function. These studies provide new insight into the diverse actions of IFN-\u03b3 in fatigue, energy metabolism, and autoimmunity. \u00a9 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

        "abstract": "Almost 50% of the infertility cases are due to male factors. Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) allow to overcome the incapacity of these patients' spermatozoa to fertilize the oocyte and produce a viable and healthy offspring, but the efficiency of the different techniques has still the potential to improve. According to the latest reports of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC), the percentages of deliveries per ART cycle in 2014 and 2016 were 21 and 22%, respectively. Among the reasons for this relatively low efficiency, the quality of the spermatozoa has been pointed out as critical, and the presence of high percentages of DNA-damaged spermatozoa in patients' ejaculates is possibly one of the main factors reducing the ARTs outcomes. Thus, one of the main challenges in reproductive medicine is to ensure the highest quality of the spermatozoa used in ARTs, and specifically, in terms of genetic integrity. The latest techniques for the preparation and selection of human spermatozoa are herein discussed focusing on those proven to improve one or several of the following parameters: sperm genetic integrity, fertilization capacity, embryo production, and ",

Despite the expression of interest and tremendous advances in research however, a modern male hormonal contraceptive method has remained an elusive goal. Testosterone (T) alone, or in combination with a progestin currently provides the most promising lead to male hormonal contraception. The principle relies on enhanced negative feedback of exogenous T to suppress gonadotropins, thereby blocking the endocrine stimulus for the process of spermatogenesis. A serious drawback is the inconsistent suppression among men of different ethnic backgrounds. This has increased the quest for development to include other nonhormonal methods. In reality many obstacles still have to be overcome before an acceptable method is available. In this review, we highlight recent developments in male hormonal contraceptives methods. Based on our recent findings from animal experiment, we shed light on why the method is not achieving the intended results, and suggest possible ways forward.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Hormonal male contraceptive regimens effectively and reversibly suppress sperm production, but there are few large-scale efficacy studies. OBJECTIVE: The safety, contraceptive efficacy, reversibility, and feasibility of injectable testosterone undecanoate (TU) in tea seed oil as a hormonal male contraceptive was assessed. DESIGN: This was a multicenter, phase III, contraceptive efficacy clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1045 healthy fertile Chinese men were recruited throughout China into the study. INTERVENTION(S): Injections of 500 mg TU were administered monthly for 30 months. A definition of severe oligozoospermia (< or =1 x 10(6)/ml) was used as a criterion of spermatogenic suppression and as the threshold for entering the contraceptive efficacy phase. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The primary outcome was pregnancy rate in the partner. Other outcomes include: semen parameters, testis volumes, reproductive hormone levels, and safety laboratory tests. RESULTS: Forty-three participants (4.8%) did not achieve azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia within the 6-month suppression phase. A total of 855 participants entered into the efficacy phase, and 733 participants completed monthly TU treatment and follow-up. There were nine pregnancies in 1554.1 person-years of exposure in the 24-month efficacy phase for a cumulative contraceptive failure rate of 1.1 per 100 men. The combined method failure rate was 6.1%, comprising 4.8% with inadequate suppression and 1.3% with postsuppression sperm rebound. No serious adverse events were reported. Spermatogenesis returned to the normal fertile reference range in all but two participants. CONCLUSIONS: Monthly injection of 500 mg TU provides safe, effective, reversible, and reliable contraception in a high proportion of healthy fertile Chinese men.",

RESULTS: Although REEs were not significantly associated with MetS, certain elements such as La, Pr, and Nd were negatively associated with abdominal obesity, whereas Ce, Pr, Nd, and Dy were positively associated with hypertension. BKMR models suggested a U-shaped relationship between mixed REEs and MetS, with varying effects on abdominal obesity and high blood pressure.

CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in the treatment of R/R childhood B-ALL, although the majority of reports have been in noninfant patients. Barriers to the successful implementation of CAR T-cell therapy in infant B-ALL include challenges related to apheresis, product manufacturing, and disease-specific considerations such as lineage switch. We describe our experience using 2 experimental CD19 CAR T-cell products, SCRI-CAR19 or SCRI-CAR19x22, for 19 patients with R/R infant B-ALL enrolled in 3 clinical trials. CAR T-cell products were successfully manufactured in 18 of 19 (94.7%) patients, with a median age of 22.5\u00a0months at enrollment (range, 14.5-40.1).

        "title": "Fatigue in older persons: the role of nutrition.",
        "abstract": "Fatigue is defined as a symptom leading to the inability to continue functioning at the expected activity level. It is a highly prevalent symptom, challenging to frame into monodimensional pathophysiological mechanisms. As a result, fatigue is often underestimated in the clinical setting and is wrongly considered an unavoidable consequence of ageing. Several potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue have been proposed, including sleep patterns, autonomic nervous system abnormalities and biological complexity. Inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the most promising mechanisms through which malnutrition may cause fatigue. Not surprisingly, fatigue is highly prevalent in inflammatory conditions (e.g. COVID-19 infection). The nutritional status may also represent a critical factor in the development and presentation of fatigue, which may mimic the exhaustion of the individual's metabolic reserves. For example, the insufficient dietary intake of energy and proteins may determine the catabolism of body fat and muscles, disrupt the homeostatic balance and cause the onset of fatigue. It is necessary to conduct research on fatigue. By characterising its pathophysiological mechanisms, it will be possible to (1) support the design and development of targeted interventions, (2) improve the quality of life of many persons by acting on the symptom and (3) reduce the direct and indirect costs of a burdening condition typical of advancing age. In the present review, we provide an overview of the role that nutrition may play as a determinant of fatigue in older people, also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "title": "Phoenix criteria for sepsis: are these enough to guide a clinician?",
        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. There is a paucity of data on the criteria used to define sepsis and septic shock and predict mortality. Schlapbach et al. published Phoenix criteria to define sepsis in JAMA in 2024. Previously, paediatricians have used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, but these criteria lack sensitivity and specificity. This group recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Though included in the 8-point criteria, important criteria like renal and liver are missing from the main criteria. We remain worried about the way these criteria got excluded from the main criteria. Therefore, in this brief report, whilst commending the authors for this stelar task, we highlight the main pitfalls in these criteria especially the renal, neurologic, and liver criteria. These criteria have been shown to be independently associated with outcomes, and we recommend that in the future iterations of the criteria, renal and liver criteria should be defined according to latest definitions and the task force consider utilizing latest criteria for each organ system involved within the formulated criteria. CONCLUSION: \u00a0In conclusion, Phoenix criteria are a step in the right direction to define life-threatening organ dysfunction in sepsis, but clinicians need to be mindful that diagnosis/treatment of less severe sepsis should not be delayed if these criteria are not met. Therefore, local early detection and management tools for sepsis should be followed. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 There has always been a quest for a definition for pediatric sepsis. There are limitations to the previous pediatric sepsis criteria which were published in 2005 by the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC). IPSCC defines sepsis as a suspected or confirmed infection in the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). These new Phoenix Pediatric Sepsis (PPS) criteria for sepsis and septic shock are intended to identify children with life-threatening organ dysfunction due to infection, and the score was developed based on a very large pediatric dataset. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022 Though the intention of Phoenix criteria is to help identify children with life threatening organ dysfunction, unfortunately the crietria will miss signs of early sepis. In this manuscript, we point out some of the drawbacks of these criteria which need to be borne in mind while applying these criteria.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine men's satisfaction with and acceptability of a once-daily, oral regimen of dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU) versus placebo when used for 28\u00a0days. STUDY DESIGN: After a Phase I double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating trial of oral DMAU for 28-days, 57 healthy male volunteers completed a survey assessing their experience and satisfaction with the regimen. In the trial, participants were randomized to receive up to 4 DMAU capsules daily versus placebo and instructed to ingest them within 30\u00a0min of consuming a high fat meal. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were performed, followed by a 6-week recovery phase. Participants were counseled that they could not rely on the drug for contraception. RESULTS: Fifty-seven participants were offered acceptability surveys (39 DMAU, 18 placebo). Most respondents, 80% (45/56), reported satisfaction with the method; 77% (44/57) would recommend it. 54% (31/57), reported that, if available, they would use the method as their primary contraceptive. More respondents reported satisfaction with active DMAU than placebo (87% vs. 67%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Most respondents, 91% (52/57), reported no difficulty with having to take up to 4 pills within 30\u00a0min of ingesting a high-fat meal. CONCLUSION: Most participants reported that the study method, daily oral DMAU or placebo, was satisfactory and acceptable. Having to take the drug after a high-fat meal did not detract from acceptability. IMPLICATIONS: Most participants in a 4-week trial of daily DMAU capsules would recommend and use the method. High satisfaction among DMAU and placebo groups affirms acceptability of a daily male contraceptive pill, warranting further study of oral DMAU.",

        "abstract": "Discoidin domain receptor (DDR)-1 has a crucial role in regulating vital processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, adhesion, migration, invasion, and matrix remodeling. Overexpression or activation of DDR1 in various pathological scenarios makes it a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer, fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and neuropsychiatric, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we summarize current therapeutic approaches targeting DDR1 from a medicinal chemistry perspective. Furthermore, we analyze factors other than issues of low selectivity and risk of resistance, contributing to the infrequent success of DDR1 inhibitors. The complex interplay between DDR1 and the extracellular matrix (ECM) necessitates additional validation, given that DDR1 might exhibit complex and synergistic interactions with other signaling molecules during ECM regulation. The mechanisms involved in DDR1 regulation in cancer and inflammation-related diseases also remain unknown.",

Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies targeting CD19 have shown success for the treatment of pediatric patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody has demonstrated efficacy in neuroblastoma. In this review, we summarize the immunotherapeutic agents that have been approved for treating childhood cancers and provide an updated review of molecules expressed by pediatric cancers that are under study or are emerging candidates for future immunotherapies. Advances in our knowledge of tumor immunology and in genome profiling of cancers has led to the identification of new tumor-specific/associated antigens. While cell surface antigens are normally targeted in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent manner using antibody-based therapies, intracellular antigens are normally targeted with MHC-dependent T cell therapies. Glypican 2 (GPC2) and B7-H3 (CD276) are two cell surface antigens that are expressed by a variety of pediatric tumors such as neuroblastoma and potentially can have a positive impact on the treatment of pediatric cancers in the clinic.",

Targeting CD20 has proved to be efficacious in several B cell-mediated immunopathologies, as illustrated by the use of rituximab, the first anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Following rituximab, second- and third-generation anti-CD20 mAbs have been developed and tried in immune-mediated diseases, including obinutuzumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, and veltuzumab. However, their safety and efficacy has not been systematically reviewed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, and veltuzumab for the treatment of immune-mediated disorders compared to placebo, conventional treatment or other biologics. METHODS: The PRISMA checklist guided the reporting of the data. We searched the PubMed database between 4 October 2016 and 22 July 2021 concentrating on immune-mediated disorders. RESULTS: The literature search identified 2220 articles.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AIMS: The targeting of solid cancers with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells faces many technological hurdles, including selection of optimal target antigens. Promising pre-clinical and clinical data of CAR T-cell activity have emerged from targeting surface antigens such as GD2 and B7H3 in childhood cancer neuroblastoma. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is expressed in a majority of neuroblastomas at low antigen density but is largely absent from healthy tissues. METHODS: To explore an alternate target antigen for neuroblastoma CAR T-cell therapy, the authors generated and screened a single-chain variable fragment library targeting ALK extracellular domain to make a panel of new anti-ALK CAR T-cell constructs. RESULTS: A lead novel CAR T-cell construct was capable of specific cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma cells expressing low levels of ALK, but with only weak cytokine and proliferative T-cell responses. To explore strategies for amplifying ALK CAR T cells, the authors generated a co-CAR approach in which T cells received signal 1 from a first-generation ALK construct and signal 2 from anti-B7H3 or GD2 chimeric co-stimulatory receptors. The co-CAR approach successfully demonstrated the ability to avoid targeting single-antigen-positive targets as a strategy for mitigating on-target off-tumor toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further proof of concept for ALK as a neuroblastoma CAR T-cell target.",

        "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS), often characterized by the accumulation of irreversible clinical disability over time. During last years, there has been a dramatic evolution in several key concepts of immune pathophysiology of MS and in the treatment of this disease. The demonstration of the strong efficacy and good safety profile of selective B-cell-depleting therapies (such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies) has significantly expanded the therapeutic scenario for both relapsing and progressive MS patients with the identification of a new therapeutic target. The key role of B cells in triggering MS disease has been also pointed out, determining a shift from the traditional view of MS activity as largely being 'T-cell mediated' to the notion that MS-related pathological processes involve bi-directional interactions between several immune cell types, including B\u00a0cells, both in the periphery and in the CNS. This review provides an updated overview of the involvement of B\u00a0cells in the immune pathophysiology and pathology of MS. We summarize the rationale regarding the use of anti-CD20 therapies and the results of the main randomized controlled trials and observational studies investigating the efficacy and safety profile of rituximab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab and ublituximab. Suggestions regarding vaccinations and management of MS patients during COVID-19 pandemic with anti-CD20 therapies are also discussed.

Disease resistance or relapse after successful initial therapy and declining efficacy of subsequent rounds of treatment were the basis for the development of alternative anti-CD20-based antibody therapies. AREAS COVERED: The novel anti-CD20 antibodies of atumumab, ublituximab, and obinutuzumab were developed to be differentiated via structural and mechanistic features over rituximab. We provide an overview of preclinical and clinical data, and demonstrate ways in which the pharmacodynamic properties of these novel agents translate into clinical benefit for patients. EXPERT OPINION: Of the novel anti-CD20 antibodies, only obinutuzumab has shown consistently improved efficacy over rituximab in randomized pivotal trials in indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The Phase 3 GALLIUM trial demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival with obinutuzumab-based immunochemotherapy over rituximab-based immunochemotherapy. Novel combinations of obinutuzumab, including with chemotherapy-free options are being explored, such as with the newly approved combinations of obinutuzumab with venetoclax, ibrutinib, or acalabrutinib. The biggest unmet need remains in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; emerging options in this field include the use of CAR-T cells and T-cell bispecific antibodies.",

        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Overrepresentation analysis (ORA) is used widely to assess the enrichment of functional categories in a gene list compared to a background list. ORA is therefore a critical method in the interpretation of 'omics data, relating gene lists to biological functions and themes. Although ORA is hugely popular, we and others have noticed two potentially undesired behaviours of some ORA tools. The first one we call the 'background problem', because it involves the software eliminating large numbers of genes from the background list if they are not annotated as belonging to any category. The second one we call the 'false discovery rate problem', because some tools underestimate the true number of parallel tests conducted. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate the impact of these issues on several real RNA-seq datasets and use simulated RNA-seq data to quantify the impact of these problems. We show that the severity of these problems depends on the gene set library, the number of genes in the list, and the degree of noise in the dataset. These problems can be mitigated by changing packages/websites for ORA or by changing to another approach such as functional class scoring.

        "abstract": "Current research on personality disorders strives to identify key behavioural and cognitive facets of patient functioning, to unravel the underlying root causes and maintenance mechanisms. This process often involves the application of social paradigms - however, these often only include momentary affective depictions rather than unfolding interactions. This constitutes a limitation in our capacity to probe core symptoms, and leaves potential findings uncovered which could help those who are in close relationships with affected individuals. Here, we deployed a novel task in which subjects interact with four unknown virtual partners in a turn-taking paradigm akin to a dance, and report on their experience with each. The virtual partners embody four combinations of low/high expressivity of positive/negative mood. Higher scores on our symptomatic measures of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were all linked to a general negative appraisal of all the interpersonal experiences. Moreover, the negative appraisal of the partner who displayed a high negative/low positive mood was tied with attachment anxiety and BPD symptoms. The extent to which subjects felt responsible for causing partners' distress was most strongly linked to attachment anxiety. Finally, we provide a fully-fledged exploration of move-by-move action latencies and click distances from partners. This analysis underscored slower movement initiation from anxiously attached individuals throughout all virtual interactions. In summary, we describe a novel paradigm for second-person neuroscience, which allowed both the replication of established results and the capture of new behavioural signatures associated with attachment anxiety, and discuss its limitations.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population. Taken together, we concluded that the IL-17 signaling pathway serves as a significant potential mechanism of sepsis and provides a promising therapeutic target for sepsis treatment.

However, there is very little known about TMEM gene expression, especially in cancer tissue. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequence may facilitate the understanding of this poorly characterized protein genes in PDAC. METHODS: We selected the TMEM family genes through the Human Protein Atlas and characterized their expression by single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. Identification of the key TMEM genes was performed through three machine learning algorithms: LASSO, SVM-RFE and RF-SRC. Then, we established TMEM gene riskscore and estimate its implication in predicting survival and response to systematic therapy. Additionally, we explored the difference and impact of TMEM gene expression in PDAC through immunohistochemistry and cell line research. RESULTS: 5 key TMEM genes (ANO1, TMEM59, TMEM204, TMEM205, TMEM92) were selected based on the single-cell analysis and machine learning survival outcomes. Patients stratified into the high and low-risk groups based on TMEM riskscore, were observed with distinct overall survival in internal and external datasets. Moreover, through bulk RNA-sequence and immunohistochemical staining we verified the protein expression of TMEM genes in PDAC and revealed TMEM92 as an essential regulator of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.

The cohort study described here is designed as a large-scale clinical validation of this previous work. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre observational study will prospectively recruit a total of 1445 newborn infants (all gestations)-1084 with suspected early-or late-onset sepsis, and 361 controls-over 4\u2009years. A small volume of whole blood will be collected from infants with suspected sepsis at the time of presentation. This sample will be used for integrated transcriptomic, lipidomic and targeted proteomics profiling. In addition, a subset of samples will be subjected to cellular phenotype and proteomic analyses. A second sample from the same patient will be collected at 24 hours, with an opportunistic sampling for stool culture. For control infants, only one set of blood and stool sample will be collected to coincide with clinical blood sampling. Along with detailed clinical information, blood and stool samples will be analysed and the information will be used to identify and validate the efficacy of immune-metabolic networks in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal sepsis and to identify new host biomarkers for viral sepsis.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We characterized referral trends over time at a transgender clinic within an integrated health system in Northern California. We identified the transition-related requests of pediatric transgender and gender-nonconforming patients and evaluated differences in referrals by age group. METHODS: Medical records were analyzed for all patients <18 years of age in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health system who were referred to a specialty transgender clinic between February 2015 and June 2018. Trends in treatment demand, demographic data, service requests, and surgical history were abstracted from medical charts and analyzed by using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: We identified 417 unique transgender and gender-nonconforming pediatric patients. The median age at time of referral was 15 years (range 3-17). Most (62%) identified on the masculine spectrum. Of the 203 patients with available ethnicity data, 68% were non-Hispanic. During the study period, the clinic received a total of 506 referrals with a significant increase over time ( CONCLUSIONS: The increase in referrals supports the need for expanded and accessible health care services for this population. The transition-related care of patients in this large sample varied by age group, underscoring the need for an individualized approach to gender-affirming care.",

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms \"sepsis,\" \"septicemia,\" or \"septic shock\" in the title or abstract. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Strong associations of several markers of organ dysfunction with the outcomes of interest among infected and septic children support their inclusion in the data validation phase of the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce.",

        "abstract": "Several years ago, dozens of cases were described in patients with symptoms very similar to mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). This new disease entity was described as mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome (MPSPS). The name of the disease indicates that in addition to the typical symptoms of conventional MPS, patients develop other features such as congenital heart defects and kidney and hematopoietic system disorders. The symptoms are highly advanced, and patients usually do not survive past the second year of life. MPSPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a homozygous-specific mutation in the gene encoding the VPS33A protein. To date, it has been described in 41 patients. Patients with MPSPS exhibited excessive excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the urine and exceptionally high levels of heparan sulfate in the plasma, but the accumulation of substrates is not caused by a decrease in the activity of any lysosomal enzymes. Here, we discuss the pathomechanisms and symptoms of MPSPS, comparing them to those of MPS. Moreover, we asked the question whether MPSPS should be classified as a type of MPS or a separate disease, as contrary to 'classical' MPS types, despite GAG accumulation, no defects in lysosomal enzymes responsible for degradation of these compounds could be detected in MPSPS. The molecular mechanism of the appearance of GAG accumulation in MPSPS is suggested on the basis of results available in the literature.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method.

Through a systematic search we identified 54 studies comprising 2066 participants that were treated with a range of cell therapy interventions. We categorized the reported 53 unique outcome instruments and additional descriptive measures into 10 categories and 12 sub-categories. Movement and Posture was the most frequently reported outcome category, followed by Safety, however Quality of Life, and various prevalent comorbidities and complications of CP were infrequently reported. Notably, many outcome instruments used do not have evaluative properties and thus are not suitable for measuring change following intervention.

Mucopolysaccharidosis-Plus Syndrome (MPSPS), an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the endo-lysosomal tethering protein VPS33A, shows additional renal and hematopoietic abnormalities (\"Plus symptoms\") uncommon in conventional MPS. Here, we analyze data from biochemical, histological, and physical examinations-particularly of blood counts and kidney function-to further characterize the clinical phenotype of MPSPS. A series of blood tests indicate hematopoietic symptoms including progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia, which correlate with histological observations of hypoplastic bone marrow. High urinary excretion of protein (caused by impairments in renal filtration), hypoalbuminemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, cholesterol, and uric acid indicate renal dysfunction. Histological analyses of MPSPS kidneys similarly suggest the extensive destruction of glomerular structures by foamy podocytes.

We aimed to compare organ dysfunction criteria in children with blood culture-proven sepsis, including emergency department, PICU, and ward patients, and to assess relevance of organ dysfunctions for mortality prediction. DESIGN: We have carried out a nonprespecified, secondary analysis of a prospective dataset collected from September 2011 to December 2015. SETTING: Emergency departments, wards, and PICUs in 10 tertiary children's hospitals in Switzerland. PATIENTS: Children younger than 17 years old with blood culture-proven sepsis. We excluded preterm infants and term infants younger than 7 days old. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC), Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2), pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA), and Pediatric Organ Dysfunction Information Update Mandate (PODIUM) scores, measured at blood culture sampling, to predict 30-day mortality. We analyzed 877 sepsis episodes in 807 children, with a 30-day mortality of 4.3%. Percentage with organ dysfunction ranged from 32.7% (IPSCC) to 55.3% (pSOFA). In adjusted analyses, the accuracy for identification of 30-day mortality was area under the curve (AUC) 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82-0.92) for IPSCC, 0.83 (0.76-0.89) for PELOD-2, 0.85 (0.78-0.92) for pSOFA, and 0.85 (0.78-0.91) for PODIUM. When restricting scores to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction, the adjusted AUC was 0.89 (0.84-0.94) for IPSCC, 0.85 (0.79-0.91) for PELOD-2, 0.87 (0.81-0.93) for pSOFA, and 0.88 (0.83-0.93) for PODIUM.

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of childhood mortality. Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

        "title": "Early detection of late-onset neonatal sepsis from noninvasive biosignals using deep learning: A multicenter prospective development and validation study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its accurate and timely diagnosis is hindered by vague symptoms and the urgent necessity for early antibiotic intervention. The gold standard for diagnosing the condition is the identification of a pathogenic organism from normally sterile sites via laboratory testing. However, this method is resource-intensive and cannot be conducted continuously. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to predict the onset of late-onset sepsis (LOS) with good diagnostic value as early as possible using non-invasive biosignal measurements from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) monitors. METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study, we developed a multimodal machine learning algorithm based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure that uses the power spectral density (PSD) of recorded biosignals to predict the onset of LOS. This approach aimed to discern LOS-related pathogenic spectral signatures without labor-intensive manual artifact removal. RESULTS: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic score of 0.810 (95\u00a0% CI 0.698-0.922) on the validation dataset. With an optimal operating point, LOS detection had 83\u00a0% sensitivity and 73\u00a0% specificity. The median early detection was 44\u00a0h before clinical suspicion. The results highlighted the additive importance of electrocardiogram and respiratory impedance (RESP) signals in improving predictive accuracy. According to a more detailed analysis, the predictive power arose from the morphology of the electrocardiogram's R-wave and sudden changes in the RESP signal. CONCLUSION: Raw biosignals from NICU monitors, in conjunction with PSD transformation, as input to the CNN, can provide state-of-the-art prediction performance for LOS without the need for artifact removal. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to highlight the independent and additive predictive potential of electrocardiogram R-wave morphology and concurrent, sudden changes in the RESP waveform in predicting the onset of LOS using non-invasive biosignals.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mortality rate for children with septic shock is stil quite high in low-income and middle-income countries (31.7%). One of the most widely used scoring systems to assess mortality in sepsis or septic shock is Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD-2). However, it requires various laboratory evaluations. A non-invasive, fast and easy method is needed to assess the mortality of children with septic shock at an early stage. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the ability of Vascular Reactivity Index (VRI) compared with PELOD-2 score as a predictor of mortality in children with septic shock based on vascular response to vasoactive agents. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from children aged 1\u2009month to 18 years with septic shock treated in the ER and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the tertiary hospital from 2017 to 2021. The serial haemodynamic data were analysed including Systemic Vascular Resistant Index (SVRI) and the cardiac index from ultrasound cardiac output monitoring device was recorded in the first and sixth hours after the diagnosis of septic shock. The VRI was determined by dividing SVRI/Vasoactive Inotropic Score (ie, accumulated doses of dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, milrinone, vasopressin and norepinephrine). The receiver operating curve was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off point. RESULTS: A total of 68 subjects fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the median age was 54 months with a range of 2-204 months and the mortality rate was 47%. The majority of the patients who died were found in the high cardiac index and low SVRI group (17.6%). Moreover, the optimum cut-off point of VRI was obtained to predict mortality in septic shock of 32.1, with 87.5% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. The AUC for predicting death using VRI was 95% (95% CI 90% to 100%, p<0.001) and PELOD-2 92.6% (95% CI 96.4% to 98.8%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The VRI <32.1\u2009may potentially be used to predict mortality in children with septic shock and its predictive ability is as good as PELOD-2. The assessment of VRI is faster and easier than PELOD-2.",

In the present study, a deep learning structure for mortality prediction of septic patients was developed and compared with several machine learning methods as well as two sepsis screening tools: the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA). The mortality predictions were explored for septic patients who died within 72 h and 28 days. Results demonstrated that the accuracy rate of deep learning methods, especially Convolutional Neural Network plus SoftMax (87.01% in 72 h and 81.59% in 28 d), exceeds that of the other machine learning methods, SIRS, and qSOFA.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms \"sepsis,\" \"septicemia,\" or \"septic shock\" in the title or abstract. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001).

The principal elements of the most recent guidelines are summarized in this practice point. These elements include recognition of changes in clinical condition and vital signs, such as fever, tachycardia, and changes in peripheral perfusion, which should raise concern for sepsis; initial stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation; timely administration of empiric antimicrobial therapy; use of fluid boluses and vasoactive medications; and specific considerations in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as the use of corticosteroids for possible adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic-adrenal suppression. Two changes from previous guidelines are the concern for fluid overload, implying the need for clinical re-assessment after administration of each fluid bolus, and the removal of dopamine as the initial vasoactive agent for use in hypotensive paediatric patients, with recommendations for the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine as dictated by the clinical context.

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Nine Canadian ICUs. SUBJECTS: Three-hundred fifty-six septic patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical data and plasma levels of biomarkers were collected longitudinally. We used a complementary log-log model to account for the daily mortality risk of each patient until death in ICU/hospital, discharge, or 28 days after admission. The model, which is a versatile version of the Cox model for gaining longitudinal insights, created a composite indicator (the daily hazard of dying) from the \"day 1\" and \"change\" variables of six time-varying biological indicators (cell-free DNA, protein C, platelet count, creatinine, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and lactate) and a set of contextual variables (age, presence of chronic lung disease or previous brain injury, and duration of stay), achieving a high predictive power (conventional area under the curve, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94). Including change variables avoided misleading inferences about the effects of day 1 variables, signifying the importance of the longitudinal approach. We then generated mortality risk profiles that highlight the relative contributions among the time-varying biological indicators to overall mortality risk. The tool was validated in 28 nonseptic patients from the same ICUs who became septic later and was subject to 10-fold cross-validation, achieving similarly high area under the curve. CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel version of the Cox model, we created a prognostic tool for septic patients that yields not only a predicted probability of dying but also a mortality risk profile that reveals how six time-varying biological indicators differentially and longitudinally account for the patient's overall daily mortality risk.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population.

SETTING: Twelve PICUs in Southwest China. PATIENTS: The patients admitted to the PICU from April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023. The age ranged from 28 days to 18 years. All patients met the criteria of severe sepsis or septic shock. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 31 PICUs invited to participate, 12 PICUs (capacity of 292 beds) enrolled patients in the study. During the study period, 11,238 children were admitted to the participating PICUs, 367 (3.3%) of whom met the diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock. The most prevalent sites of infection were the respiratory system (55%) and the digestive system (15%). The primary treatments administered to these patients included antibiotics (100%), albumin (61.3%), invasive mechanical ventilation (58.7%), glucocorticoids (55.6%), blood products (51%), gammaglobulin (51%), and vasoactive medications (46.6%). Sepsis-related mortality in the PICU was 11.2% (41/367). Nearly half of the sepsis deaths occurred within the first 3 days of PICU admission (22/41, 53.7%). The mortality rate of septic shock (32/167, 19.2%) was significantly higher than that of severe sepsis (9/200, 4.5%; p < 0.001). The outcomes of a multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that a higher pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and the use of invasive mechanical ventilation and vasoactive medications were independently associated with PICU mortality in children with sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: This report updates the epidemiological data of pediatric sepsis in PICUs in Southwest China. Sepsis is still a life-threatening disease in children.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as potential molecular biomarkers for sepsis. We aimed to profile the expression signature of three inflammation-related lncRNAs, MALAT1, ANRIL, and HHOTAIR, in the plasma of neonates with sepsis and correlate these signatures with the phenotype. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This case-control study included 124 neonates with sepsis (88 survivors/36 non-survivors) admitted to the neonatal ICU and 17 healthy neonates. The relative expressions were quantified by real-time PCR and correlated to the clinic-laboratory data. RESULTS: The three circulating lncRNAs were upregulated in the cases; the median levels were MALAT1 (median = 1.71, IQR: -0.5 to 3.27), ANRIL (median = 1.09, IQR: 0.89 to 1.30), and HOTAIR (median = 1.83, IQR: 1.44 to 2.41).

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To study the metabolic mechanism of neonatal sepsis at different stages by analyzing the metabolic pathways involving the serum metabolites with significant differences in neonates with sepsis at different time points after admission. METHODS: A total of 20 neonates with sepsis who were hospitalized in the Department of Neonatology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, from January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2020 were enrolled as the sepsis group. Venous blood samples were collected on days 1, 4, and 7 after admission. Ten healthy neonates who underwent physical examination during the same period were enrolled as the control group. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for the metabonomic analysis of serum samples to investigate the change in metabolomics in neonates with sepsis at different time points. RESULTS: On day 1 after admission, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between the sepsis and control groups were mainly involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid skeleton. For the sepsis group, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 4 after admission were mainly involved in pyruvate metabolism, and those between days 4 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in the metabolism of cysteine and methionine. The differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in ascorbic acid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic mechanism of serum metabolites varies at different stages in neonates with sepsis and is mainly associated with terpenoid skeleton biosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism, cysteine/methionine metabolism, and ascorbic acid metabolism.

        "title": "Host gene expression signatures to identify infection type and organ dysfunction in children evaluated for sepsis: a multicentre cohort study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "title": "Male contraception: narrative review of ongoing research.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the release of the combined oral contraceptive pill in 1960, women have shouldered the burden of contraception and family planning. Over 60 years later, this is still the case as the only practical, effective contraceptive options available to men are condoms and vasectomy. However, there are now a variety of promising hormonal and non-hormonal male contraceptive options being studied. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide clinicians and laypeople with focused, up-to-date descriptions of novel strategies and targets for male contraception. We include a cautiously optimistic discussion of benefits and potential drawbacks, highlighting several methods in preclinical and clinical stages of development. RESULTS: As of June 2023, two hormonal male contraceptive methods are undergoing phase II clinical trials for safety and efficacy. A large-scale, international phase IIb trial investigating efficacy of transdermal segesterone acetate (Nestorone) plus testosterone gel has enrolled over 460 couples with completion estimated for late 2024. A second hormonal method, dimethandrolone undecanoate, is in two clinical trials focusing on safety, pharmacodynamics, suppression of spermatogenesis and hormones; the first of these two is estimated for completion in December 2024. There are also several non-hormonal methods with strong potential in preclinical stages of development. CONCLUSIONS: There exist several hurdles to novel male contraception. Therapeutic development takes decades of time, meticulous work, and financial investment, but with so many strong candidates it is our hope that there will soon be several safe, effective, and reversible contraceptive options available to male patients. R\u00e9SUM\u00e9: CONTEXTE: Depuis la sortie de la pilule contraceptive orale combin\u00e9e en 1960, les femmes ont assum\u00e9 le fardeau de la contraception et de la planification familiale. Plus de 60 ans plus tard, c\u2019est toujours le cas, car les seules options contraceptives pratiques et efficaces disponibles pour les hommes sont les pr\u00e9servatifs et la vasectomie. Cependant, il existe maintenant une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019options contraceptives masculines hormonales et non hormonales prometteuses qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude. Le but de cette revue narrative est de fournir aux cliniciens et aux profanes des descriptions cibl\u00e9es et \u00e0 jour de nouvelles strat\u00e9gies et cibles pour la contraception masculine. Nous incluons une discussion prudemment optimiste sur les avantages et les inconv\u00e9nients potentiels, en soulignant plusieurs m\u00e9thodes aux stades pr\u00e9cliniques et cliniques du d\u00e9veloppement. R\u00e9SULTATS: En juin 2023, deux m\u00e9thodes contraceptives masculines hormonales faisaient l\u2019objet d\u2019essais cliniques de phase II pour leur innocuit\u00e9 et leur efficacit\u00e9. Un essai international de phase IIb \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle, portant sur l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de l\u2019ac\u00e9tate de s\u00e9gest\u00e9rone transdermique (Nestorone) et du gel de testost\u00e9rone, a recrut\u00e9 plus de 460 couples et devrait \u00eatre achev\u00e9 pour la fin de 2024. Une seconde m\u00e9thode hormonale, l\u2019und\u00e9canoate de dim\u00e9thandrolone, fait l\u2019objet de deux essais cliniques ax\u00e9s sur l\u2019innocuit\u00e9, la pharmacodynamique, la suppression de la spermatogen\u00e8se et des hormones; le premier de ces deux essais devrait \u00eatre achev\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 2024. Il existe \u00e9galement plusieurs m\u00e9thodes non hormonales \u00e0 fort potentiel aux stades pr\u00e9cliniques de d\u00e9veloppement. CONCLUSIONS: Il existe plusieurs obstacles \u00e0 la nouvelle contraception masculine. Le d\u00e9veloppement th\u00e9rapeutique n\u00e9cessite des d\u00e9cennies de temps, un travail m\u00e9ticuleux et un investissement financier ; mais avec autant de candidats solides, nous esp\u00e9rons qu\u2019il y aura bient\u00f4t plusieurs options contraceptives s\u00fbres, efficaces et r\u00e9versibles, disponibles pour les hommes.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Previous studies applying Sepsis-3 criteria to children were based on retrospective analyses of PICU cohorts. We aimed to compare organ dysfunction criteria in children with blood culture-proven sepsis, including emergency department, PICU, and ward patients, and to assess relevance of organ dysfunctions for mortality prediction. DESIGN: We have carried out a nonprespecified, secondary analysis of a prospective dataset collected from September 2011 to December 2015. SETTING: Emergency departments, wards, and PICUs in 10 tertiary children's hospitals in Switzerland. PATIENTS: Children younger than 17 years old with blood culture-proven sepsis. We excluded preterm infants and term infants younger than 7 days old. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC), Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2), pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA), and Pediatric Organ Dysfunction Information Update Mandate (PODIUM) scores, measured at blood culture sampling, to predict 30-day mortality. We analyzed 877 sepsis episodes in 807 children, with a 30-day mortality of 4.3%. Percentage with organ dysfunction ranged from 32.7% (IPSCC) to 55.3% (pSOFA). In adjusted analyses, the accuracy for identification of 30-day mortality was area under the curve (AUC) 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82-0.92) for IPSCC, 0.83 (0.76-0.89) for PELOD-2, 0.85 (0.78-0.92) for pSOFA, and 0.85 (0.78-0.91) for PODIUM. When restricting scores to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction, the adjusted AUC was 0.89 (0.84-0.94) for IPSCC, 0.85 (0.79-0.91) for PELOD-2, 0.87 (0.81-0.93) for pSOFA, and 0.88 (0.83-0.93) for PODIUM. CONCLUSIONS: IPSCC, PELOD-2, pSOFA, and PODIUM performed similarly to predict 30-day mortality. Simplified scores restricted to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction yielded comparable performance.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide expression profiles have been previously employed as clinical research diagnostic tools for newborn sepsis. We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal, progressive disease of the motor system. Most approved treatments have a modest effect on disease progression. Tofersen is a recently approved medication that acts by reducing a toxic protein found in a particular form of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This is an overview of the published clinical data for tofersen as well as some background information about tofersen and other treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.What were the results? Treatment with tofersen reduced levels of the target protein and markers of nervous system damage. In longer follow-up, patients treated with tofersen showed less disease progression.What do the results of the study mean? Treatment with tofersen likely slows progression in this form of inherited ALS, though longer duration studies would likely be needed to demonstrate this effect.",

The patient underwent an open reduction and T8-L3 posterior fusion in the operating room. A complete cross-section of the spinal cord was observed during surgery. Post operation, a decrease in blood pressure led to a thoracotomy and thoracic endovascular aortic repair due to a crack in the descending aorta wall. Thoracolumbar fracture-dislocations, particularly in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, are characterized by instability and can be further complicated by concurrent vascular and spinal cord injuries. It is crucial therefore to recognize the potential for vascular and spinal cord injuries early on in such cases.",

        "abstract": "The transition metal characteristics of iron allow it to play a fundamental role in several essential aspects of human life such as the transport of oxygen through hemoglobin or the transport of electrons in the mitochondrial respiratory chain coupled to the synthesis of ATP. However, an excess or deficiency of iron is related to certain pathologies. The maintenance of iron homeostasis is essential to avoid certain pathologies related to iron excess or deficiency. The existence of iron deposits in postmortem tissues of Parkinson's patients has been interpreted as evidence that iron plays a fundamental role in the degenerative process of the nigrostriatal system in this disease. The use of iron chelators has been successful in the treatment of diseases such as transfusion-dependent thalassemia and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. However, a clinical study with the iron chelator deferiprone in patients with Parkinson's disease has not shown positive effects but rather worsened clinical symptoms. This suggests that iron may not play a role in the degenerative process of Parkinson's disease.",

METHOD: Patients were recruited from the department of surgery in a large medical center in Taiwan. In this longitudinal pilot study, the Fatigue Symptom Inventory and fasting blood samples were collected at three assessments (i.e., prior to surgery (T0), three months (T1) and six months (T2) after surgery). Metabolomic profile analysis was used. Multilevel regression and pathway analyses were performed to identify differences in metabolomic profiles between the fatigued and non-fatigued groups. RESULTS: Of the 49 patients, 55.1% (n\u00a0=\u00a027) were in the fatigue group. All of the 15 metabolites that had statistically significant group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interactions in the differential metabolite analysis were entered into the pathway analysis. Two pathways were enriched for these metabolites, namely galactose metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this pilot study suggest that pathways involved in galactose metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis are associated with cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with CRC during CTX. These findings are consistent with the hypotheses that alterations in energy metabolism and increases in inflammation are associated with the development and maintenance of CRF.",

However, while clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been conducted in recent years, the results have not always been favorable. The results from a Phase III trial of the antisense oligonucleotide, that is, tofersen, which targets SOD1 mRNA, showed decreased levels of cerebrospinal fluid SOD1 and plasma neurofilament light chain but no improvements in primary clinical endpoint. Moreover, case reports pertaining to patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis carrying FUS and C9orf72 mutations who received antisense oligonucleotide-based treatments have demonstrated a notable reduction in the targeted protein (thus providing the proof of mechanism) but with no discernible clinical benefits. There are several possible reasons why antisense oligonucleotides knockdown fails to achieve proof of concept, which need to be addressed: on-target adverse effects resulting from the loss of function of target gene and irreversible neuronal death cascade due to toxic protein accumulation, among other factors. This review provides an overview of the current status and discusses the prospects of antisense oligonucleotides treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

Although progress in the therapeutic field remains unsatisfactory, we have to notice that genetics have undergone impressive improvements over the last three decades and, by extension, our knowledge of ALS cases linked to a pathogenic mutation that accounts for 10% of all cases (either sporadic or familiar) and is currently called hereditary ALS (hALS). In many neurological diseases treatment targeting pathogenic genes have significatively improved the natural profile of the disease: this is perfectly illustrated for familial amyloid neuropathy and spinal muscular atrophy. Because of these findings and the urgent need to find a cure for ALS, many trials have focused on familial ALS targeting the four most important genes linked to the disease: C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS. We propose in this review an update on the perspectives of treatment that may be available in mid-term in hALS and will discuss in the last part the potential consequences for asymptomatic relatives of patients with a hALS and for ALS patients.",

Screening of four main genes (C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS) identified the causes in 15% of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients (two third of the familial cases and 8% of the sporadic ones) but their respective contribution to ALS phenotype varies according the age of disease onset. The genetic overlap between ALS and other diseases is expanding and includes frontotemporal dementia, Paget's Disease of Bone, myopathy for adult cases, HSP and CMT for young cases highlighing the importance of retrieving the exhaustive familial history for each indivdual with ALS. Incomplete disease penetrance, diversity of the possible phenotypes, as well as the lack of confidence concerning the pathogenicity of most identified variants and/or possible oligogenic inheritance are burdens of ALS genetic counseling to be delivered to patients and at risk individuals.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess Gram-positive bacterial (GPB) bloodstream infection (BSI) in neonates, covering incidence, morbidity, mortality, antimicrobial resistance patterns and biomarkers in Region Stockholm, Sweden between 2006 and 2016. METHODS: A population-based retrospective epidemiological study including infants with GPB-BSI, admitted to the neonatal units at Karolinska University Hospital (KUH). Data were collected from patient records, the Swedish Neonatal Quality Register, the microbiological laboratory at KUH and the Swedish Public Health Agency. RESULTS: We identified 357 infants with GPB-BSI, representing an incidence of 1.47/1000 live births (LB). Group B streptococcus (GBS) was the most common pathogen causing BSI in full-term infants and early-onset sepsis (EOS) (0.20/1000 LB), while coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were predominant in infants born very preterm and in late-onset sepsis (LOS) (0.79/1000 LB). There were no fatal GBS BSI cases, but 10.2% developed meningitis. The GPB case fatality rate was 9.5% and the sepsis fatality rate 2.8%. In GPB-BSI, 1/10 did not have an elevated C-reactive protein level. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) BSI increased during the study period, but no methicillin or vancomycin resistant strains were found. The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rate was highest in CoNS isolates. CONCLUSION: GPB-BSI was four times more common than Gram-negative BSI in neonates but resulted in lower mortality rate. GBS was the most common pathogen in full-term infants and in EOS. CoNS was the most common pathogen in LOS and infants born very preterm, and the AMR rate was high in these isolates. The increasing trend of S. aureus BSI indicates a need of further investigation.",

        "abstract": "Despite extensive research, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a progressive and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease. Limited knowledge of the underlying causes of ALS has made it difficult to target upstream biological mechanisms of disease, and therapeutic interventions are usually administered relatively late in the course of disease. Genetic forms of ALS offer a unique opportunity for therapeutic development, as genetic associations may reveal potential insights into disease etiology. Genetic ALS may also be amenable to investigating earlier intervention given the possibility of identifying clinically presymptomatic, at-risk individuals with causative genetic variants. There is increasing evidence for a presymptomatic phase of ALS, with biomarker data from the Pre-Symptomatic Familial ALS (Pre-fALS) study showing that an elevation in blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) precedes phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease. Tofersen is an investigational antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce synthesis of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein through degradation of SOD1 mRNA. Informed by Pre-fALS and the tofersen clinical development program, the ATLAS study (NCT04856982) is designed to evaluate the impact of initiating tofersen in presymptomatic carriers of SOD1 variants associated with high or complete penetrance and rapid disease progression who also have biomarker evidence of disease activity (elevated plasma NfL). The ATLAS study will investigate whether tofersen can delay the emergence of clinically manifest ALS. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first interventional trial in presymptomatic ALS and has the potential to yield important insights into the design and conduct of presymptomatic trials, identification, and monitoring of at-risk individuals, and future treatment paradigms in ALS.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parental mental illness is common and can lead to dependent children incurring a high risk of developing mental disorders, physical illness, and impaired educational and occupational outcomes. Family Talk is one of the better known interventions designed to prevent the intergenerational transmission of mental illness. However, its evidence base is small, with few robust independent randomised controlled trials, and no associated process or cost evaluations. The PRIMERA (Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children) research programme involves a mixed method evaluation of Family Talk which is being delivered in mental health settings in Ireland to improve child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness. METHODS: The study comprises a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT), with nested economic and process evaluations, to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness and implementation mechanisms of Family Talk compared to usual services. The study is being conducted in 15 adult and child mental health settings in Ireland. Families with a parent with mental illness, and children aged 5-18\u2009years (n\u2009=\u2009144 families) will be randomised to either the 7-session Family Talk programme (n\u2009=\u200996) or to standard care (n\u2009=\u200948) using a 2:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcomes are child psychosocial functioning and family functioning. Secondary outcomes are as follows: understanding and experience of parental mental illness, parental mental health, child and parental resilience, partner wellbeing and service utilisation. Blind assessments will take place at pre-intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Given the prevalence and burden of intergenerational mental illness, it is imperative that prevention through evidence-based interventions becomes a public health priority. The current study will provide an important contribution to the international evidence base for Family Talk whilst also helping to identify key implementation lessons in the scaling up of Family Talk, and other similar interventions, within routine mental health settings.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Previous studies applying Sepsis-3 criteria to children were based on retrospective analyses of PICU cohorts. We aimed to compare organ dysfunction criteria in children with blood culture-proven sepsis, including emergency department, PICU, and ward patients, and to assess relevance of organ dysfunctions for mortality prediction. DESIGN: We have carried out a nonprespecified, secondary analysis of a prospective dataset collected from September 2011 to December 2015. SETTING: Emergency departments, wards, and PICUs in 10 tertiary children's hospitals in Switzerland. PATIENTS: Children younger than 17 years old with blood culture-proven sepsis. We excluded preterm infants and term infants younger than 7 days old. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC), Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2), pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA), and Pediatric Organ Dysfunction Information Update Mandate (PODIUM) scores, measured at blood culture sampling, to predict 30-day mortality. We analyzed 877 sepsis episodes in 807 children, with a 30-day mortality of 4.3%. Percentage with organ dysfunction ranged from 32.7% (IPSCC) to 55.3% (pSOFA). In adjusted analyses, the accuracy for identification of 30-day mortality was area under the curve (AUC) 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82-0.92) for IPSCC, 0.83 (0.76-0.89) for PELOD-2, 0.85 (0.78-0.92) for pSOFA, and 0.85 (0.78-0.91) for PODIUM. When restricting scores to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction, the adjusted AUC was 0.89 (0.84-0.94) for IPSCC, 0.85 (0.79-0.91) for PELOD-2, 0.87 (0.81-0.93) for pSOFA, and 0.88 (0.83-0.93) for PODIUM. CONCLUSIONS: IPSCC, PELOD-2, pSOFA, and PODIUM performed similarly to predict 30-day mortality. Simplified scores restricted to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction yielded comparable performance.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method. The model has better diagnostic performance compared with conventional inflammatory indicators such as CRP, Hb, NEU%, and PCT.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition, occurring when an infectious agent invades the body, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2\u03bcg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin. Early detection of bacteria followed by antimicrobial susceptibility test can help by selection of appropriate antibiotic and prevent spread of infection.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population. Taken together, we concluded that the IL-17 signaling pathway serves as a significant potential mechanism of sepsis and provides a promising therapeutic target for sepsis treatment.

        "abstract": "The potential health effects of exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) remain largely unexplored. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

All preterm newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were eligible for this proof-of-concept, prospective case-control study. Infants were enrolled as \"cases\" if they developed EOS, and as \"controls\"if they did not. Plasma samples collected at birth and urine samples collected within 24 h of birth underwent untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis using mass spectrometry coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Of 123 eligible newborns, 15 developed EOS. These 15 newborns matched controls for gestational age and weight. Metabolomic analysis revealed evident clustering of the cases versus controls, with the glutathione and tryptophan metabolic pathways markedly disrupted in the former. In conclusion, neonates with EOS had a metabolic profile at birth that clearly distinguished them from those without sepsis, and metabolites of glutathione and tryptophan pathways are promising as new biomarkers of neonatal sepsis.",

We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

The cohort study described here is designed as a large-scale clinical validation of this previous work. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre observational study will prospectively recruit a total of 1445 newborn infants (all gestations)-1084 with suspected early-or late-onset sepsis, and 361 controls-over 4\u2009years. A small volume of whole blood will be collected from infants with suspected sepsis at the time of presentation. This sample will be used for integrated transcriptomic, lipidomic and targeted proteomics profiling. In addition, a subset of samples will be subjected to cellular phenotype and proteomic analyses. A second sample from the same patient will be collected at 24 hours, with an opportunistic sampling for stool culture. For control infants, only one set of blood and stool sample will be collected to coincide with clinical blood sampling. Along with detailed clinical information, blood and stool samples will be analysed and the information will be used to identify and validate the efficacy of immune-metabolic networks in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal sepsis and to identify new host biomarkers for viral sepsis.

Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We report the protocol for the SNOOPY (Staphylococcus aureus Network; ultrasOund for diagnOsis of endovascular disease in Paediatrics and Youth) study. SNOOPY is a pilot prospective single-arm interventional study that aims to investigate the proportion of children with SAB that have venous thrombosis detected using whole body doppler ultrasound.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

Electrophysiological studies from brainstem slices prepared from pups exposed to either TLR4 or PAM3CSK4 showed compromised transmission between preB\u00f6tzinger complex and Hypoglossal as an exclusive response to the TLR1/2 ligand. Spatial gene expression analysis demonstrated a region-specific modulation of PAM3CSK4 within the raphe nucleus relative to other anatomical sites evaluated.

This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment.

Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method. The model has better diagnostic performance compared with conventional inflammatory indicators such as CRP, Hb, NEU%, and PCT.",

The principal elements of the most recent guidelines are summarized in this practice point. These elements include recognition of changes in clinical condition and vital signs, such as fever, tachycardia, and changes in peripheral perfusion, which should raise concern for sepsis; initial stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation; timely administration of empiric antimicrobial therapy; use of fluid boluses and vasoactive medications; and specific considerations in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as the use of corticosteroids for possible adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic-adrenal suppression. Two changes from previous guidelines are the concern for fluid overload, implying the need for clinical re-assessment after administration of each fluid bolus, and the removal of dopamine as the initial vasoactive agent for use in hypotensive paediatric patients, with recommendations for the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine as dictated by the clinical context.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide expression profiles have been previously employed as clinical research diagnostic tools for newborn sepsis. We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

We aim to determine whether peripheral blood gene expression profiles are associated with pathogen type and sepsis severity in children with suspected sepsis. METHODS: This was a prospective pilot observational study in a tertiary pediatric emergency department with a convenience sample of children enrolled. Participants were older than 56 days and younger than 18 years, had suspected sepsis, and had not received broad-spectrum antibiotics in the previous 4 hours. Primary outcome was source pathogen, defined as confirmed bacterial source from sterile body fluid or confirmed viral source. Secondary outcome was sepsis severity, defined as maximum therapy required for shock reversal in the first 3 hospital days. We drew peripheral blood for ribonucleic acid isolation at the sepsis protocol activation, obtained gene expression measures with the GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array, and conducted differential expression analysis. RESULTS: We collected ribonucleic acid samples from a convenience sample of 122 children with suspected sepsis and 12 healthy controls. We compared the 66 children (54%) with confirmed bacterial or viral infection and found 558 differentially expressed genes, many related to interferon signaling or viral immunity. We did not find statistically significant gene expression differences in patients according to sepsis severity. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates feasibility of evaluating gene expression profiling data in children evaluated for sepsis in the pediatric emergency department setting. Our results suggest that gene expression profiling may facilitate identification of source pathogen in children with suspected sepsis, which could ultimately lead to improved tailoring of sepsis treatment and antimicrobial stewardship.",

Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

Electrophysiological studies from brainstem slices prepared from pups exposed to either TLR4 or PAM3CSK4 showed compromised transmission between preB\u00f6tzinger complex and Hypoglossal as an exclusive response to the TLR1/2 ligand. Spatial gene expression analysis demonstrated a region-specific modulation of PAM3CSK4 within the raphe nucleus relative to other anatomical sites evaluated. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes due to inflammation might be a crucial tolerance mechanism for neonatal sepsis preserving neural control of breathing.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To study the metabolic mechanism of neonatal sepsis at different stages by analyzing the metabolic pathways involving the serum metabolites with significant differences in neonates with sepsis at different time points after admission. METHODS: A total of 20 neonates with sepsis who were hospitalized in the Department of Neonatology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, from January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2020 were enrolled as the sepsis group. Venous blood samples were collected on days 1, 4, and 7 after admission. Ten healthy neonates who underwent physical examination during the same period were enrolled as the control group. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for the metabonomic analysis of serum samples to investigate the change in metabolomics in neonates with sepsis at different time points. RESULTS: On day 1 after admission, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between the sepsis and control groups were mainly involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid skeleton. For the sepsis group, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 4 after admission were mainly involved in pyruvate metabolism, and those between days 4 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in the metabolism of cysteine and methionine. The differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in ascorbic acid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic mechanism of serum metabolites varies at different stages in neonates with sepsis and is mainly associated with terpenoid skeleton biosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism, cysteine/methionine metabolism, and ascorbic acid metabolism.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

Epidemiological data about sepsis from the 2017 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factor Study showed that the global burden of sepsis was greater than previously estimated. Bacteria have been shown to be the predominant pathogen of sepsis among patients with pathogens detected, while sepsis caused by viruses is underdiagnosed worldwide. The coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 in China and now in many other countries has brought viral sepsis back into the vision of physicians and researchers worldwide. Although the current understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis has improved, the differences between viral and bacterial sepsis at the level of pathophysiology are not well understood. Diagnosis methods that can broadly differentiate between bacterial and viral sepsis at the initial stage after the development of sepsis are limited. New treatments that can be applied at clinics for sepsis are scarce and this situation is not consistent with the growing understanding of pathophysiology. This review aims to give a brief summary of current knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of viral sepsis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide expression profiles have been previously employed as clinical research diagnostic tools for newborn sepsis. We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

The screened abstracts were independently considered for eligibility by two researchers. PROSPERO ID: CRD42020164454. RESULTS: The search identified in total 762 articles. Fifteen articles were assessed for eligibility. Four studies were included, with totally 78 neonates. The studies used different diagnostic criteria and had between 1 and 16 sepsis cases. All studies with bacterial sepsis found alterations in the glucose and lactate metabolism, reflecting possible redistribution of glucose consumption from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to the lactate and pentose phosphate pathway. We also found signs of increased oxidative stress and fatty acid oxidation in sepsis cases. CONCLUSION: We found signs of metabolomic signatures in neonatal sepsis. This may lead to better understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and detection of new candidate biomarkers. Results should be validated in large-scale multicentre studies.",

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms \"sepsis,\" \"septicemia,\" or \"septic shock\" in the title or abstract. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001).

CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in the treatment of R/R childhood B-ALL, although the majority of reports have been in noninfant patients. Barriers to the successful implementation of CAR T-cell therapy in infant B-ALL include challenges related to apheresis, product manufacturing, and disease-specific considerations such as lineage switch. We describe our experience using 2 experimental CD19 CAR T-cell products, SCRI-CAR19 or SCRI-CAR19x22, for 19 patients with R/R infant B-ALL enrolled in 3 clinical trials. CAR T-cell products were successfully manufactured in 18 of 19 (94.7%) patients, with a median age of 22.5\u00a0months at enrollment (range, 14.5-40.1). Of 17 (94.1%) treated patients, 16 achieved a complete remission without detectable minimal residual disease. The 1-year leukemia-free survival was 75%, and 1-year overall survival was 76.5%, with a median follow-up time of 35.8\u00a0months (range, 1.7-83.6). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 14 of 17 (82.4%) patients, with only 1 patient experiencing grade 3 CRS. Neurotoxicity occurred in 2 of 17 (11.8%) patients with all events grade \u22642.

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) is a relatively new treatment for pediatric leukemia and has been the focus of recent advancements. CAR is manufactured to express T cells through various ways such as using retroviruses, transposons and transposase, electroporation, and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Together, it provides flexibility since it recognizes proteins without the need of antigen processing and presentation, can recognize carbohydrates and lipids, and it has been proven to be cost-effective. Despite these benefits however, problems faced by this therapy include unrecognized tumor proteins possibly escaping the system, CAR T cell expression being transient, and the therapy being one of the most expensive cancer drug ever approved. As a result, recent progress has been ongoing where researchers have combined CAR-T cells with natural killer (NK) cells and different cytokines to maximize its efficacy and potency while limiting potential risks such as cytokine release syndrome. Consequently, these cells gained the ability to be universal-being able to be used to treat multiple patients, maintain viability for a longer period, and prevent relapse.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AIMS: The targeting of solid cancers with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells faces many technological hurdles, including selection of optimal target antigens. Promising pre-clinical and clinical data of CAR T-cell activity have emerged from targeting surface antigens such as GD2 and B7H3 in childhood cancer neuroblastoma. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is expressed in a majority of neuroblastomas at low antigen density but is largely absent from healthy tissues. METHODS: To explore an alternate target antigen for neuroblastoma CAR T-cell therapy, the authors generated and screened a single-chain variable fragment library targeting ALK extracellular domain to make a panel of new anti-ALK CAR T-cell constructs. RESULTS: A lead novel CAR T-cell construct was capable of specific cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma cells expressing low levels of ALK, but with only weak cytokine and proliferative T-cell responses. To explore strategies for amplifying ALK CAR T cells, the authors generated a co-CAR approach in which T cells received signal 1 from a first-generation ALK construct and signal 2 from anti-B7H3 or GD2 chimeric co-stimulatory receptors. The co-CAR approach successfully demonstrated the ability to avoid targeting single-antigen-positive targets as a strategy for mitigating on-target off-tumor toxicity.

        "abstract": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated high rates of response in recurrent B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in children and young adults. Despite this success, a fraction of patients' experience relapse after treatment. Relapse is often preceded by recovery of healthy B cells, which suggests loss or dysfunction of CAR T-cells in bone marrow. This site is harder to access, and thus is not monitored as frequently as peripheral blood. Understanding the interplay between B cells, leukemic cells, and CAR T-cells in bone marrow is paramount in ascertaining the causes of lack of response. In this paper, we put forward a mathematical model representing the interaction between constantly renewing B cells, CAR T-cells, and leukemic cells in the bone marrow. Our model accounts for the maturation dynamics of B cells and incorporates effector and memory CAR T-cells. The model provides a plausible description of the dynamics of the various cellular compartments in bone marrow after CAR T infusion. After exploration of the parameter space, we found that the dynamics of CAR T product and disease were independent of the dose injected, initial B-cell load, and leukemia burden. We also show theoretically the importance of CAR T product attributes in determining therapy outcome, and have studied a variety of possible response scenarios, including second dosage schemes. We conclude by setting out ideas for the refinement of the model.",

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has become the standard of care for children and young adults with relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and it is a highly promising therapy under investigation for adults with relapsed disease. Despite having potentially life-threatening toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, the benefits of CAR T-cell therapy far outweigh these risks, particularly as increased experience and improved supportive care measures are mitigating these toxicities. CAR T cells can result in complete remission for significant proportion of patients with relapsed and refractory B-ALL and permit them to proceed to potentially curative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). CAR T cells may also be curative by themselves. Herein lie the greatest challenges and questions for clinical investigators, specifically, how are CAR T cells best employed and how do we overcome mechanisms of resistance to them? The primary clinical question is the timing and even the necessity of allo-HSCT. Relative to resistance, we know that target antigen loss, specifically CD19, is a major contributor to resistance. However, current investigations of alternative targets, such CD22, and CAR T cells expressing dual targeting antigen receptors have demonstrated encouraging initial results and provide a high degree of optimism that the efficacy and the broader application of CAR T-cell therapy will gradually increase in B-ALL. That optimism is not as high and the challenges are increased for the application of CAR T cells in T-cell leukemias and acute myeloid leukemia due to the relative lack of suitable leukemia surface targets that are not also expressed on normal hematopoietic progenitors. Despite these significant challenges, considerable research is being conducted into the development of CAR T cells for these diseases utilizing unique technologies, which may be applicable to other diseases.",

Outcomes are particularly poor for children with refractory, relapsed, or metastatic disease. Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cells are an exciting form of adoptive cell therapy that potentially offers new hope for these children. In early trials, promising outcomes have been achieved in some pediatric patients with sarcoma. However, many children do not derive benefit despite significant expression of the targeted tumor antigen. The success of CAR T cell therapy in sarcomas and other solid tumors is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we provide an update of the CAR T cell therapies that are currently being tested in pediatric sarcoma clinical trials, including those targeting tumors that express HER2, NY-ESO, GD2, EGFR, GPC3, B7-H3, and MAGE-A4. We also outline promising new CAR T cells that are in pre-clinical development. Finally, we discuss strategies that are being used to overcome tumor-mediated immunosuppression in solid tumors; these strategies have the potential to improve clinical outcomes of CAR T cell therapy for children with sarcoma.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

We aimed to compare organ dysfunction criteria in children with blood culture-proven sepsis, including emergency department, PICU, and ward patients, and to assess relevance of organ dysfunctions for mortality prediction. DESIGN: We have carried out a nonprespecified, secondary analysis of a prospective dataset collected from September 2011 to December 2015. SETTING: Emergency departments, wards, and PICUs in 10 tertiary children's hospitals in Switzerland. PATIENTS: Children younger than 17 years old with blood culture-proven sepsis. We excluded preterm infants and term infants younger than 7 days old. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC), Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2), pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA), and Pediatric Organ Dysfunction Information Update Mandate (PODIUM) scores, measured at blood culture sampling, to predict 30-day mortality. We analyzed 877 sepsis episodes in 807 children, with a 30-day mortality of 4.3%. Percentage with organ dysfunction ranged from 32.7% (IPSCC) to 55.3% (pSOFA). In adjusted analyses, the accuracy for identification of 30-day mortality was area under the curve (AUC) 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82-0.92) for IPSCC, 0.83 (0.76-0.89) for PELOD-2, 0.85 (0.78-0.92) for pSOFA, and 0.85 (0.78-0.91) for PODIUM. When restricting scores to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction, the adjusted AUC was 0.89 (0.84-0.94) for IPSCC, 0.85 (0.79-0.91) for PELOD-2, 0.87 (0.81-0.93) for pSOFA, and 0.88 (0.83-0.93) for PODIUM.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS.

However, there is very little known about TMEM gene expression, especially in cancer tissue. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequence may facilitate the understanding of this poorly characterized protein genes in PDAC. METHODS: We selected the TMEM family genes through the Human Protein Atlas and characterized their expression by single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. Identification of the key TMEM genes was performed through three machine learning algorithms: LASSO, SVM-RFE and RF-SRC. Then, we established TMEM gene riskscore and estimate its implication in predicting survival and response to systematic therapy. Additionally, we explored the difference and impact of TMEM gene expression in PDAC through immunohistochemistry and cell line research. RESULTS: 5 key TMEM genes (ANO1, TMEM59, TMEM204, TMEM205, TMEM92) were selected based on the single-cell analysis and machine learning survival outcomes. Patients stratified into the high and low-risk groups based on TMEM riskscore, were observed with distinct overall survival in internal and external datasets. Moreover, through bulk RNA-sequence and immunohistochemical staining we verified the protein expression of TMEM genes in PDAC and revealed TMEM92 as an essential regulator of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSION: Our study on TMEM gene expression and behavior in PDAC has revealed unique characteristics, offering potential for precise therapeutic approaches.

OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the performance of a multicenter network for ultra-rapid genomic diagnosis in a public health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Descriptive feasibility study of critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions treated at 12 Australian hospitals between March 2018 and February 2019, with data collected to May 2019. A formal implementation strategy emphasizing communication and feedback, standardized processes, coordination, distributed leadership, and collective learning was used to facilitate adoption. EXPOSURES: Ultra-rapid exome sequencing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report. The secondary outcomes were the molecular diagnostic yield, the change in clinical management after the ultra-rapid exome sequencing report, the time from hospital admission to the laboratory report, and the proportion of laboratory reports returned prior to death or hospital discharge. RESULTS: The study population included 108 patients with a median age of 28 days (range, 0 days to 17 years); 34% were female; and 57% were from neonatal intensive care units, 33% were from pediatric intensive care units, and 9% were from other hospital wards. The mean time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 3.3 days (95% CI, 3.2-3.5 days) and the median time was 3 days (range, 2-7 days). The mean time from hospital admission to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 17.5 days (95% CI, 14.6-21.1 days) and 93 reports (86%) were issued prior to death or hospital discharge. A molecular diagnosis was established in 55 patients (51%). Eleven diagnoses (20%) resulted from using the following approaches to augment standard exome sequencing analysis: mitochondrial genome sequencing analysis, exome sequencing-based copy number analysis, use of international databases to identify novel gene-disease associations, and additional phenotyping and RNA analysis. In 42 of 55 patients (76%) with a molecular diagnosis and 6 of 53 patients (11%) without a molecular diagnosis, the ultra-rapid exome sequencing result was considered as having influenced clinical management. Targeted treatments were initiated in 12 patients (11%), treatment was redirected toward palliative care in 14 patients (13%), and surveillance for specific complications was initiated in 19 patients (18%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests feasibility of ultra-rapid genomic testing in critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions in the Australian public health care system.

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Diagnosing neonatal sepsis is heavily dependent on clinical phenotyping as culture-positive body fluid has poor sensitivity, and existing blood biomarkers have poor specificity.A combination of machine learning, statistical and deep pathway biology analyses led to the identification of a tripartite panel of biologically connected immune and metabolic markers that showed greater than 99% accuracy for detecting bacterial infection with 100% sensitivity. The cohort study described here is designed as a large-scale clinical validation of this previous work. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre observational study will prospectively recruit a total of 1445 newborn infants (all gestations)-1084 with suspected early-or late-onset sepsis, and 361 controls-over 4\u2009years. A small volume of whole blood will be collected from infants with suspected sepsis at the time of presentation. This sample will be used for integrated transcriptomic, lipidomic and targeted proteomics profiling. In addition, a subset of samples will be subjected to cellular phenotype and proteomic analyses. A second sample from the same patient will be collected at 24 hours, with an opportunistic sampling for stool culture. For control infants, only one set of blood and stool sample will be collected to coincide with clinical blood sampling. Along with detailed clinical information, blood and stool samples will be analysed and the information will be used to identify and validate the efficacy of immune-metabolic networks in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal sepsis and to identify new host biomarkers for viral sepsis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received research ethics committee approval from the Wales Research Ethics Committee 2 (reference 19/WA/0008) and operational approval from Health and Care Research Wales. Submission of study results for publication will involve making available all anonymised primary and processed data on public repository sites. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03777670.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to suspected or proven infection. Given its importance in terms of morbidity and mortality, a number of initiatives by several professional societies in recent years have led to the development of guidelines for the recognition and timely management of sepsis. The principal elements of the most recent guidelines are summarized in this practice point. These elements include recognition of changes in clinical condition and vital signs, such as fever, tachycardia, and changes in peripheral perfusion, which should raise concern for sepsis; initial stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation; timely administration of empiric antimicrobial therapy; use of fluid boluses and vasoactive medications; and specific considerations in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as the use of corticosteroids for possible adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic-adrenal suppression. Two changes from previous guidelines are the concern for fluid overload, implying the need for clinical re-assessment after administration of each fluid bolus, and the removal of dopamine as the initial vasoactive agent for use in hypotensive paediatric patients, with recommendations for the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine as dictated by the clinical context.

        "title": "Phoenix criteria for sepsis: are these enough to guide a clinician?",
        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. There is a paucity of data on the criteria used to define sepsis and septic shock and predict mortality. Schlapbach et al. published Phoenix criteria to define sepsis in JAMA in 2024. Previously, paediatricians have used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, but these criteria lack sensitivity and specificity. This group recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Though included in the 8-point criteria, important criteria like renal and liver are missing from the main criteria. We remain worried about the way these criteria got excluded from the main criteria. Therefore, in this brief report, whilst commending the authors for this stelar task, we highlight the main pitfalls in these criteria especially the renal, neurologic, and liver criteria. These criteria have been shown to be independently associated with outcomes, and we recommend that in the future iterations of the criteria, renal and liver criteria should be defined according to latest definitions and the task force consider utilizing latest criteria for each organ system involved within the formulated criteria. CONCLUSION: \u00a0In conclusion, Phoenix criteria are a step in the right direction to define life-threatening organ dysfunction in sepsis, but clinicians need to be mindful that diagnosis/treatment of less severe sepsis should not be delayed if these criteria are not met. Therefore, local early detection and management tools for sepsis should be followed. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 There has always been a quest for a definition for pediatric sepsis. There are limitations to the previous pediatric sepsis criteria which were published in 2005 by the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC). IPSCC defines sepsis as a suspected or confirmed infection in the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). These new Phoenix Pediatric Sepsis (PPS) criteria for sepsis and septic shock are intended to identify children with life-threatening organ dysfunction due to infection, and the score was developed based on a very large pediatric dataset. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022 Though the intention of Phoenix criteria is to help identify children with life threatening organ dysfunction, unfortunately the crietria will miss signs of early sepis. In this manuscript, we point out some of the drawbacks of these criteria which need to be borne in mind while applying these criteria.",

        "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare disability causing female-oriented pediatric neurodevelopmental unmet medical need. RTT was recognized in 1966. However, over the past 56 years, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has authorized no effective treatment for RTT. Recently, Trofinetide was approved by the USFDA on 10 March 2023 as the first RTT treatment. This article underlines the pharmaceutical advancement, patent literature, and prospects of Trofinetide. The data for this study were gathered from the PubMed database, authentic websites (Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Neuren Pharmaceuticals, and USFDA), and free patent databases. Trofinetide was first disclosed by Neuren Pharmaceuticals in 2000 as a methyl group containing analog of the naturally occurring neuroprotective tripeptide called glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE). The joint efforts of Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Neuren Pharmaceuticals have developed Trofinetide. The mechanism of action of Trofinetide is not yet well established. However, it is supposed to improve neuronal morphology and synaptic functioning. The patent literature revealed a handful of inventions related to Trofinetide, providing excellent and unexplored broad research possibilities with Trofinetide. The development of innovative Trofinetide-based molecules, combinations of Trofinetide, patient-compliant drug formulations, and precise MECP2-mutation-related personalized medicines are foreseeable. Trofinetide is in clinical trials for some neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including treating Fragile X syndrome (FXS). It is expected that Trofinetide may be approved for treating FXS in the future. The USFDA-approval of Trofinetide is one of the important milestones for RTT therapy and is the beginning of a new era for the therapy of RTT, FXS, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), brain injury, stroke, and other NDDs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aggregated \u03b1-synuclein plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The monoclonal antibody prasinezumab, directed at aggregated \u03b1-synuclein, is being studied for its effect on Parkinson's disease. METHODS: In this phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned participants with early-stage Parkinson's disease in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive intravenous placebo or prasinezumab at a dose of 1500 mg or 4500 mg every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 52 in the sum of scores on parts I, II, and III of the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS; range, 0 to 236, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). Secondary end points included the dopamine transporter levels in the putamen of the hemisphere ipsilateral to the clinically more affected side of the body, as measured by  RESULTS: A total of 316 participants were enrolled; 105 were assigned to receive placebo, 105 to receive 1500 mg of prasinezumab, and 106 to receive 4500 mg of prasinezumab. The baseline mean MDS-UPDRS scores were 32.0 in the placebo group, 31.5 in the 1500-mg group, and 30.8 in the 4500-mg group, and mean (\u00b1SE) changes from baseline to 52 weeks were 9.4\u00b11.2 in the placebo group, 7.4\u00b11.2 in the 1500-mg group (difference vs. placebo, -2.0; 80% confidence interval [CI], -4.2 to 0.2; P\u2009=\u20090.24), and 8.8\u00b11.2 in the 4500-mg group (difference vs. placebo, -0.6; 80% CI, -2.8 to 1.6; P\u2009=\u20090.72). There was no substantial difference between the active-treatment groups and the placebo group in dopamine transporter levels on SPECT. The results for most clinical secondary end points were similar in the active-treatment groups and the placebo group. Serious adverse events occurred in 6.7% of the participants in the 1500-mg group and in 7.5% of those in the 4500-mg group; infusion reactions occurred in 19.0% and 34.0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Prasinezumab therapy had no meaningful effect on global or imaging measures of Parkinson's disease progression as compared with placebo and was associated with infusion reactions.

The manifestations of Parkinson's disease often include resting tremor, stiffness, bradykinesia, and muscular rigidity. The typical hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the destruction of neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies in different compartments of the central nervous system. Due to various limitations to the currently available treatments, immunotherapies have emerged to be the new approach to Parkinson's disease treatment. This approach shows some positive outcomes on the efficacy by removing the aggregated species of alpha-synuclein, which is believed to be one of the causes of Parkinson's disease. In this review, an overview of how alpha-synuclein contributes to Parkinson's disease and the effects of a few new immunotherapeutic treatments, including BIIB054 (cinpanemab), MEDI1341, AFFITOPE, and PRX002 (prasinezumab) that are currently under clinical development, will be discussed.",

        "abstract": "Current research on personality disorders strives to identify key behavioural and cognitive facets of patient functioning, to unravel the underlying root causes and maintenance mechanisms. This process often involves the application of social paradigms - however, these often only include momentary affective depictions rather than unfolding interactions. This constitutes a limitation in our capacity to probe core symptoms, and leaves potential findings uncovered which could help those who are in close relationships with affected individuals. Here, we deployed a novel task in which subjects interact with four unknown virtual partners in a turn-taking paradigm akin to a dance, and report on their experience with each. The virtual partners embody four combinations of low/high expressivity of positive/negative mood. Higher scores on our symptomatic measures of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were all linked to a general negative appraisal of all the interpersonal experiences. Moreover, the negative appraisal of the partner who displayed a high negative/low positive mood was tied with attachment anxiety and BPD symptoms. The extent to which subjects felt responsible for causing partners' distress was most strongly linked to attachment anxiety. Finally, we provide a fully-fledged exploration of move-by-move action latencies and click distances from partners. This analysis underscored slower movement initiation from anxiously attached individuals throughout all virtual interactions. In summary, we describe a novel paradigm for second-person neuroscience, which allowed both the replication of established results and the capture of new behavioural signatures associated with attachment anxiety, and discuss its limitations.",

        "abstract": "Fatigue is defined as a symptom leading to the inability to continue functioning at the expected activity level. It is a highly prevalent symptom, challenging to frame into monodimensional pathophysiological mechanisms. As a result, fatigue is often underestimated in the clinical setting and is wrongly considered an unavoidable consequence of ageing. Several potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue have been proposed, including sleep patterns, autonomic nervous system abnormalities and biological complexity. Inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the most promising mechanisms through which malnutrition may cause fatigue. Not surprisingly, fatigue is highly prevalent in inflammatory conditions (e.g. COVID-19 infection). The nutritional status may also represent a critical factor in the development and presentation of fatigue, which may mimic the exhaustion of the individual's metabolic reserves. For example, the insufficient dietary intake of energy and proteins may determine the catabolism of body fat and muscles, disrupt the homeostatic balance and cause the onset of fatigue. It is necessary to conduct research on fatigue. By characterising its pathophysiological mechanisms, it will be possible to (1) support the design and development of targeted interventions, (2) improve the quality of life of many persons by acting on the symptom and (3) reduce the direct and indirect costs of a burdening condition typical of advancing age. In the present review, we provide an overview of the role that nutrition may play as a determinant of fatigue in older people, also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, still represents one of the most common causes of persisting disability with an early disease onset. Growing evidence suggests B cells to play a crucial role in its pathogenesis and progression. Over the last decades, monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against the surface protein CD20 have been intensively studied as a B cell targeting therapy in relapsing MS (RMS) as well as primary progressive MS (PPMS). Pivotal studies on anti-CD20 therapy in RMS showed remarkable clinical and radiological effects, especially on acute inflammation and relapse biology. These results paved the way for further research on the implication of B cells in the pathogenesis of MS. Besides controlling relapse development in RMS, ocrelizumab (OCR) also showed clinical benefits in patients with PPMS and became the first approved drug for this disease course. In this review, we provide an overview of the current anti-CD20 mabs used or tested for the treatment of MS-namely rituximab (RTX), OCR, ofatumumab (OFA), and ublituximab (UB). Besides their effectiveness, we also discuss possible limitations and safety concerns especially in regard to long-term treatment, both for this class of drugs overall as well as for each anti-CD20 mab individually. Additionally, we elucidate to what extent anti-CD20 therapy may alter the function of other immune cells, both directly or indirectly.

        "abstract": "The effect of cytokines on non-traditional immunological targets under conditions of chronic inflammation is an ongoing subject of study. Fatigue is a symptom often associated with autoimmune diseases. Chronic inflammatory response and activated cell-mediated immunity are associated with cardiovascular myopathies which can be driven by muscle weakness and fatigue. Thus, we hypothesize that immune dysfunction-driven changes in myocyte mitochondria may play a critical role in fatigue-related pathogenesis. We show that persistent low-level expression of IFN-\u03b3 in designated IFN-\u03b3 AU-Rich Element deletion mice (ARE mice) under androgen exposure resulted in mitochondrial and metabolic deficiencies in myocytes from male or castrated ARE mice. Most notably, echocardiography unveiled that low ejection fraction in the left ventricle post-stress correlated with mitochondrial deficiencies, explaining how heart function decreases under stress. We report that inefficiencies and structural changes in mitochondria, with changes to expression of mitochondrial genes, are linked to male-biased fatigue and acute cardiomyopathy under stress. Our work highlights how male androgen hormone backgrounds and active autoimmunity reduce mitochondrial function and the ability to cope with stress and how pharmacological blockade of stress signal protects heart function. These studies provide new insight into the diverse actions of IFN-\u03b3 in fatigue, energy metabolism, and autoimmunity. \u00a9 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

        "abstract": "Several years ago, dozens of cases were described in patients with symptoms very similar to mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). This new disease entity was described as mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome (MPSPS). The name of the disease indicates that in addition to the typical symptoms of conventional MPS, patients develop other features such as congenital heart defects and kidney and hematopoietic system disorders. The symptoms are highly advanced, and patients usually do not survive past the second year of life. MPSPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a homozygous-specific mutation in the gene encoding the VPS33A protein. To date, it has been described in 41 patients. Patients with MPSPS exhibited excessive excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the urine and exceptionally high levels of heparan sulfate in the plasma, but the accumulation of substrates is not caused by a decrease in the activity of any lysosomal enzymes. Here, we discuss the pathomechanisms and symptoms of MPSPS, comparing them to those of MPS. Moreover, we asked the question whether MPSPS should be classified as a type of MPS or a separate disease, as contrary to 'classical' MPS types, despite GAG accumulation, no defects in lysosomal enzymes responsible for degradation of these compounds could be detected in MPSPS. The molecular mechanism of the appearance of GAG accumulation in MPSPS is suggested on the basis of results available in the literature.",

        "title": "Digitally augmented, parent-led CBT versus treatment as usual for child anxiety problems in child mental health services in England and Northern Ireland: a pragmatic, non-inferiority, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety problems are common in children, yet few affected children access evidence-based treatment. Digitally augmented psychological therapies bring potential to increase availability of effective help for children with mental health problems. This study aimed to establish whether therapist-supported, digitally augmented, parent-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could increase the efficiency of treatment without compromising clinical effectiveness and acceptability. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, unblinded, two-arm, multisite, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapist-supported, parent-led CBT using the Online Support and Intervention (OSI) for child anxiety platform compared with treatment as usual for child (aged 5-12 years) anxiety problems in 34 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in England and Northern Ireland. We examined acceptability of OSI plus therapist support via qualitative interviews. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OSI plus therapist support or treatment as usual, minimised by child age, gender, service type, and baseline child anxiety interference. Outcomes were assessed at week 14 and week 26 after randomisation. The primary clinical outcome was parent-reported interference caused by child anxiety at week 26 assessment, using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale-parent report (CAIS-P). The primary measure of health economic effect was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Outcome analyses were conducted blind in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with a standardised non-inferiority margin of 0\u00b733 for clinical analyses. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, 12890382. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2020, and Aug 3, 2022, 706 families (706 children and their parents or carers) were referred to the study information. 444 families were enrolled. Parents reported 255 (58%) child participants' gender to be female, 184 (41%) male, three (<1%) other, and one (<1%) preferred not to report their child's gender. 400 (90%) children were White and the mean age was 9\u00b720 years (SD 1\u00b779). 85% of families for whom clinicians provided information in the treatment as usual group received CBT. OSI plus therapist support was non-inferior for parent-reported anxiety interference on the CAIS-P (SMD 0\u00b701, 95% CI -0\u00b715 to 0\u00b717; p<0\u00b70001) and all secondary outcomes. The mean difference in QALYs across trial arms approximated to zero, and OSI plus therapist support was associated with lower costs than treatment as usual. OSI plus therapist support was likely to be cost effective under certain scenarios, but uncertainty was high. OSI plus therapist support acceptability was good. No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Digitally augmented intervention brought promising savings without compromising outcomes and as such presents a valuable tool for increasing access to psychological therapies and meeting the demand for treatment of child anxiety problems.

Conventional MPS, caused by inborn deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes involved in GAG degradation, display various multisystemic symptoms-including progressive neurological complications, ophthalmological disorders, hearing loss, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary issues, cardiorespiratory problems, bone and joint abnormalities, dwarfism, and coarse facial features. Mucopolysaccharidosis-Plus Syndrome (MPSPS), an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the endo-lysosomal tethering protein VPS33A, shows additional renal and hematopoietic abnormalities (\"Plus symptoms\") uncommon in conventional MPS. Here, we analyze data from biochemical, histological, and physical examinations-particularly of blood counts and kidney function-to further characterize the clinical phenotype of MPSPS. A series of blood tests indicate hematopoietic symptoms including progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia, which correlate with histological observations of hypoplastic bone marrow. High urinary excretion of protein (caused by impairments in renal filtration), hypoalbuminemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, cholesterol, and uric acid indicate renal dysfunction. Histological analyses of MPSPS kidneys similarly suggest the extensive destruction of glomerular structures by foamy podocytes. Height and weight did not significantly deviate from the average, but in some cases, growth began to decline at around six months or one year of age.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition, occurring when an infectious agent invades the body, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2\u03bcg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin. Early detection of bacteria followed by antimicrobial susceptibility test can help by selection of appropriate antibiotic and prevent spread of infection.",

        "title": "Male contraception: narrative review of ongoing research.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the release of the combined oral contraceptive pill in 1960, women have shouldered the burden of contraception and family planning. Over 60 years later, this is still the case as the only practical, effective contraceptive options available to men are condoms and vasectomy. However, there are now a variety of promising hormonal and non-hormonal male contraceptive options being studied. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide clinicians and laypeople with focused, up-to-date descriptions of novel strategies and targets for male contraception. We include a cautiously optimistic discussion of benefits and potential drawbacks, highlighting several methods in preclinical and clinical stages of development. RESULTS: As of June 2023, two hormonal male contraceptive methods are undergoing phase II clinical trials for safety and efficacy. A large-scale, international phase IIb trial investigating efficacy of transdermal segesterone acetate (Nestorone) plus testosterone gel has enrolled over 460 couples with completion estimated for late 2024. A second hormonal method, dimethandrolone undecanoate, is in two clinical trials focusing on safety, pharmacodynamics, suppression of spermatogenesis and hormones; the first of these two is estimated for completion in December 2024. There are also several non-hormonal methods with strong potential in preclinical stages of development. CONCLUSIONS: There exist several hurdles to novel male contraception. Therapeutic development takes decades of time, meticulous work, and financial investment, but with so many strong candidates it is our hope that there will soon be several safe, effective, and reversible contraceptive options available to male patients. R\u00e9SUM\u00e9: CONTEXTE: Depuis la sortie de la pilule contraceptive orale combin\u00e9e en 1960, les femmes ont assum\u00e9 le fardeau de la contraception et de la planification familiale. Plus de 60 ans plus tard, c\u2019est toujours le cas, car les seules options contraceptives pratiques et efficaces disponibles pour les hommes sont les pr\u00e9servatifs et la vasectomie. Cependant, il existe maintenant une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019options contraceptives masculines hormonales et non hormonales prometteuses qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude. Le but de cette revue narrative est de fournir aux cliniciens et aux profanes des descriptions cibl\u00e9es et \u00e0 jour de nouvelles strat\u00e9gies et cibles pour la contraception masculine. Nous incluons une discussion prudemment optimiste sur les avantages et les inconv\u00e9nients potentiels, en soulignant plusieurs m\u00e9thodes aux stades pr\u00e9cliniques et cliniques du d\u00e9veloppement. R\u00e9SULTATS: En juin 2023, deux m\u00e9thodes contraceptives masculines hormonales faisaient l\u2019objet d\u2019essais cliniques de phase II pour leur innocuit\u00e9 et leur efficacit\u00e9.

        "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare disability causing female-oriented pediatric neurodevelopmental unmet medical need. RTT was recognized in 1966. However, over the past 56 years, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has authorized no effective treatment for RTT. Recently, Trofinetide was approved by the USFDA on 10 March 2023 as the first RTT treatment. This article underlines the pharmaceutical advancement, patent literature, and prospects of Trofinetide. The data for this study were gathered from the PubMed database, authentic websites (Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Neuren Pharmaceuticals, and USFDA), and free patent databases. Trofinetide was first disclosed by Neuren Pharmaceuticals in 2000 as a methyl group containing analog of the naturally occurring neuroprotective tripeptide called glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE). The joint efforts of Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Neuren Pharmaceuticals have developed Trofinetide. The mechanism of action of Trofinetide is not yet well established. However, it is supposed to improve neuronal morphology and synaptic functioning. The patent literature revealed a handful of inventions related to Trofinetide, providing excellent and unexplored broad research possibilities with Trofinetide. The development of innovative Trofinetide-based molecules, combinations of Trofinetide, patient-compliant drug formulations, and precise MECP2-mutation-related personalized medicines are foreseeable. Trofinetide is in clinical trials for some neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including treating Fragile X syndrome (FXS). It is expected that Trofinetide may be approved for treating FXS in the future. The USFDA-approval of Trofinetide is one of the important milestones for RTT therapy and is the beginning of a new era for the therapy of RTT, FXS, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), brain injury, stroke, and other NDDs.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Trofinetide was recently approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome (RTT) on the basis of the efficacy and safety findings of the phase\u00a03 LAVENDER study, which used a body weight-based dosing regimen. Exposure-response (E-R) efficacy modeling was used to characterize relationships between trofinetide exposure measures (maximum drug concentration and area under the concentration-time curve for the dosing interval of 0-12\u00a0h [AUC METHODS: Efficacy endpoints were modeled using trofinetide exposure measures predicted from the population pharmacokinetic model and Bayesian estimates. The analysis population for each E-R model comprised individuals receiving placebo or trofinetide who had available trofinetide exposure measures. Efficacy endpoints were scores from the Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire (RSBQ), the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement, the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile\u2122 Infant-Toddler Checklist (CSBS-DP-IT) Social Composite, and the Rett Syndrome Clinician Rating of Ability to Communicate Choices (RTT-COMC). RESULTS: Higher trofinetide exposure was associated with improvements in RSBQ, CSBS-DP-IT Social Composite, and RTT-COMC scores. Assuming target trofinetide AUC CONCLUSION: E-R efficacy modeling demonstrated significant relationships between trofinetide exposure and RSBQ, CSBS-DP-IT Social Composite, and RTT-COMC scores. Trofinetide is efficacious within the target exposure range, supporting the approved dosing regimen for trofinetide. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01703533, NCT02715115, NCT04181723. Trofinetide is the first approved treatment for people living with Rett syndrome, a rare genetic condition affecting brain development. This approval was based on the findings of clinical studies in which trofinetide showed significant improvements in the symptoms of Rett syndrome. In this study researchers were looking to see if the level of trofinetide in the blood was related to the level of improvement in symptoms observed in clinical studies. Information on the effectiveness of trofinetide was obtained from the phase\u00a03 LAVENDER study which used doses of trofinetide according to body weight. Trofinetide\u2019s effectiveness was assessed on the basis of clinical measurements of key Rett syndrome symptoms. All the information on trofinetide dose, blood levels, and how much symptoms changed (i.e., effectiveness of trofinetide) was then used to develop models to predict symptom responses in the observed population. Researchers found that as the blood levels of trofinetide increased the symptom improvement also increased. When the blood levels were at the recommended level that was achieved in the LAVENDER study, the model predicted that symptom improvement was up to seven times greater with trofinetide than having no treatment (i.e., placebo). This study shows a positive relationship between trofinetide blood levels and improvement in the symptoms of Rett syndrome. Trofinetide was effective within the recommended blood level range in the LAVENDER study using the approved weight-based dosing.",

        "abstract": "Analytic morphomics refers to the accurate measurement of specific biological markers of human body composition in diagnostic medical imaging. The increasing prevalence of disease processes that alter body composition including obesity, cachexia, and sarcopenia has generated interest in specific targeted measurement of these metrics to possibly prevent or reduce negative health outcomes. Typical morphomic measurements include the area and density of muscle, bone, vascular calcification, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat on a specific validated axial level in the patient's cross-sectional diagnostic imaging. A distinct advantage of these measurements is that they can be made retrospectively and opportunistically with pre-existing datasets. We provide a narrative review of the current state of art in morphomics, but also consider some potential future directions for this exciting field. Imaging based quantitative assessment of body composition has enormous potential across the breadth and scope of modern clinical practice. From risk stratification to treatment planning, and outcome assessment, all can be enhanced with the use of analytic morphomics. Moreover, it is likely that many new opportunities for personalized medicine will emerge as the field evolves. As radiologists, embracing analytic morphomics will enable us to contribute added value in the care of every patient.",

METHODS: We used a cross-sectional design based on the baseline data of the Prospective Cohort Study of Chronic Diseases in Ethnic Minority Natural Population in Guangxi in China. Logistic regression and BKMR models were employed to evaluate the association between REEs and risk of MetS. RESULTS: Although REEs were not significantly associated with MetS, certain elements such as La, Pr, and Nd were negatively associated with abdominal obesity, whereas Ce, Pr, Nd, and Dy were positively associated with hypertension. BKMR models suggested a U-shaped relationship between mixed REEs and MetS, with varying effects on abdominal obesity and high blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that exposure to REEs may be associated with a reduced risk of abdominal obesity and an increased risk of high blood pressure.",

A radiologic finding of a bamboo spine, a characteristic feature of ankylosing spondylitis, was observed on computed tomography, along with a fracture-dislocation involving T10 and T11 (chalk-stick fracture) and compression of the descending thoracic aorta due to the caudal bony column. The patient underwent an open reduction and T8-L3 posterior fusion in the operating room. A complete cross-section of the spinal cord was observed during surgery. Post operation, a decrease in blood pressure led to a thoracotomy and thoracic endovascular aortic repair due to a crack in the descending aorta wall. Thoracolumbar fracture-dislocations, particularly in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, are characterized by instability and can be further complicated by concurrent vascular and spinal cord injuries. It is crucial therefore to recognize the potential for vascular and spinal cord injuries early on in such cases.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of childhood mortality. Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

BBB disruptions were performed on healthy and GBM-bearing mice (U-87 MG xenograft orthotopic model). The BBB recovery kinetics were followed and quantified by [99mTc]Tc-DTPA SPECT/CT imaging at 0.5 h, 3 h and 24 h post-FUS.

Yet we lack data in medical students who are at risk of addictive behavior. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of cannabis consumption and cannabis use disorder (CUD) among French medical students and their association with psychotropic drug consumption and psychosocial factors. Medical students were recruited from 35 French universities of medicine through administration mailing lists and social networks, between December 2016 and May 2017. Cannabis consumption was self-declared by anonymous questionnaire and CUD was defined by a Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) score\u2009\u2265\u20093. 10,985 medical students with a mean age of 21.8\u00a0years (\u00b1\u20093.3) were included, 32% of which were men. Overall, 1642 [14.9 (14.3; 15.6)%] reported cannabis consumption and 622 [5.7 (5.2; 6.1)%] students were identified with CUD at screening. Men were at two-time higher risk of cannabis consumption and three-time higher risk of CUD (22.4% and 10.6% for men vs. 11.5% and 3.4%, respectively, for women). In multivariate analyses, men sex, alcohol use disorder, tobacco smoking, parents' divorce, and history of physical assault and lower rates of lower rates of\u2009\u2265\u200940 weekly worked hours were identified as common associated factors for cannabis consumption and CUD. Hypnotic consumption, psychiatric follow-up, and history of sexual assault were identified as factors associated specifically with CUD, suggesting that these factors were associated with more severe cannabis consumption. Only 17% of students identified with CUD reported a psychiatric follow-up. Altogether, these results suggest that health policies should target cannabis consumption in medical students that is frequent, especially in men, with low rates of psychiatric follow-up. We have identified psychological factors and increased hypnotic drug consumption in CUD participants suggesting that psychiatric follow-up should be systematically proposed to this group.",

Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess Gram-positive bacterial (GPB) bloodstream infection (BSI) in neonates, covering incidence, morbidity, mortality, antimicrobial resistance patterns and biomarkers in Region Stockholm, Sweden between 2006 and 2016. METHODS: A population-based retrospective epidemiological study including infants with GPB-BSI, admitted to the neonatal units at Karolinska University Hospital (KUH). Data were collected from patient records, the Swedish Neonatal Quality Register, the microbiological laboratory at KUH and the Swedish Public Health Agency. RESULTS: We identified 357 infants with GPB-BSI, representing an incidence of 1.47/1000 live births (LB). Group B streptococcus (GBS) was the most common pathogen causing BSI in full-term infants and early-onset sepsis (EOS) (0.20/1000 LB), while coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were predominant in infants born very preterm and in late-onset sepsis (LOS) (0.79/1000 LB). There were no fatal GBS BSI cases, but 10.2% developed meningitis. The GPB case fatality rate was 9.5% and the sepsis fatality rate 2.8%. In GPB-BSI, 1/10 did not have an elevated C-reactive protein level. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) BSI increased during the study period, but no methicillin or vancomycin resistant strains were found. The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rate was highest in CoNS isolates. CONCLUSION: GPB-BSI was four times more common than Gram-negative BSI in neonates but resulted in lower mortality rate. GBS was the most common pathogen in full-term infants and in EOS. CoNS was the most common pathogen in LOS and infants born very preterm, and the AMR rate was high in these isolates. The increasing trend of S. aureus BSI indicates a need of further investigation.",

Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7th Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD \u00b1 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged .16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged .15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called 'invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised riskbehaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the \"invisible\" risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.",

Evidence was found for a bidirectional relationship in girls, with depressive symptoms being a risk factor for increased self-harm one year later and self-harm a risk factor for increased depressive symptoms. Cluster analysis of profiles of depressive symptoms led to the identification of two clusters with clear depressive profiles (one severe, the other mild/moderate) which were both characterized by an overrepresentation of girls and elevated levels of self-harm. Clusters with more circumscribed problems were also identified; of these, significantly increased levels of self-harm were found in a cluster characterized by negative self-image and in a cluster characterized by dysphoric relations to parents. It is suggested that self-harm serves more to regulate negative self-related feelings than sadness.",

The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of deliberate cutaneous self-harm without suicidal intent among secondary school teenagers of the Lodz region. A self-administered specially designed anonymous questionnaire was delivered to 1,448 secondary school teenagers, aged 12-19 years. The lifetime prevalence of self-reported deliberate self-harm was 19.5%, out of which 14.4% confirmed isolated cutaneous self-injury (self-cutting in the vast majority of cases), 1.7% ingested a substance or drug in excessive amounts and 3.5% declared both behaviours. Our results indicate that skin is the organ most commonly involved in deliberate self-harm. Dermatologists, especially those focussed on dermatosurgery and aesthetic dermatology, should understand the special issues relating to such patients before taking decisions concerning performing any procedures on these individuals, since deliberate self-harm has been recognised as one of the main risk factors of suicide.",

        "abstract": "France has been identified with one of the highest rates of cannabis consumption of Western European countries. Yet we lack data in medical students who are at risk of addictive behavior. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of cannabis consumption and cannabis use disorder (CUD) among French medical students and their association with psychotropic drug consumption and psychosocial factors. Medical students were recruited from 35 French universities of medicine through administration mailing lists and social networks, between December 2016 and May 2017. Cannabis consumption was self-declared by anonymous questionnaire and CUD was defined by a Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) score\u2009\u2265\u20093. 10,985 medical students with a mean age of 21.8\u00a0years (\u00b1\u20093.3) were included, 32% of which were men. Overall, 1642 [14.9 (14.3; 15.6)%] reported cannabis consumption and 622 [5.7 (5.2; 6.1)%] students were identified with CUD at screening. Men were at two-time higher risk of cannabis consumption and three-time higher risk of CUD (22.4% and 10.6% for men vs. 11.5% and 3.4%, respectively, for women). In multivariate analyses, men sex, alcohol use disorder, tobacco smoking, parents' divorce, and history of physical assault and lower rates of lower rates of\u2009\u2265\u200940 weekly worked hours were identified as common associated factors for cannabis consumption and CUD. Hypnotic consumption, psychiatric follow-up, and history of sexual assault were identified as factors associated specifically with CUD, suggesting that these factors were associated with more severe cannabis consumption. Only 17% of students identified with CUD reported a psychiatric follow-up. Altogether, these results suggest that health policies should target cannabis consumption in medical students that is frequent, especially in men, with low rates of psychiatric follow-up. We have identified psychological factors and increased hypnotic drug consumption in CUD participants suggesting that psychiatric follow-up should be systematically proposed to this group.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence is a prevalent public health issue associated with all-cause maternal mortality. This study investigated the relationship between intimate partner violence, severe acute maternal morbidity in the intensive care unit (ICU), and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study in a hospital in Lima, Peru, with 109 cases (maternal ICU admissions) and 109 controls (obstetric patients not admitted to the ICU). Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and medical record review. Partner violence was assessed using the World Health Organization instrument. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the association between intimate partner violence and severe acute maternal morbidity. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher rate of intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy among cases (58.7%) than controls (27.5%). In multivariate analysis, intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy (aOR 3.83 (95% CI: 1.99-7.37)), being married (3.86 (1.27-11.73)), having <8 antenatal care visits (2.78 (1.14-6.80)), and having previous abortions (miscarriage, therapeutic, or unsafe) (1.69 (1.13-2.51)) were significantly associated with severe acute maternal morbidity. The ICU admission rate was 18.8 (per 1000 live births), and ICU maternal mortality was 1.7%. The perinatal mortality rate was higher in cases (9.3%) than in controls (1.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Intimate partner violence was associated with an increased risk of severe acute maternal morbidity. This suggests a more severe impact of intimate partner violence on pregnancy than has been previously identified. Inquiring about intimate partner violence during prenatal visits may prevent further harm to the mother-baby dyad.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety problems are common in children, yet few affected children access evidence-based treatment. Digitally augmented psychological therapies bring potential to increase availability of effective help for children with mental health problems. This study aimed to establish whether therapist-supported, digitally augmented, parent-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could increase the efficiency of treatment without compromising clinical effectiveness and acceptability. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, unblinded, two-arm, multisite, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapist-supported, parent-led CBT using the Online Support and Intervention (OSI) for child anxiety platform compared with treatment as usual for child (aged 5-12 years) anxiety problems in 34 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in England and Northern Ireland. We examined acceptability of OSI plus therapist support via qualitative interviews. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OSI plus therapist support or treatment as usual, minimised by child age, gender, service type, and baseline child anxiety interference. Outcomes were assessed at week 14 and week 26 after randomisation. The primary clinical outcome was parent-reported interference caused by child anxiety at week 26 assessment, using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale-parent report (CAIS-P). The primary measure of health economic effect was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Outcome analyses were conducted blind in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with a standardised non-inferiority margin of 0\u00b733 for clinical analyses. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, 12890382. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2020, and Aug 3, 2022, 706 families (706 children and their parents or carers) were referred to the study information. 444 families were enrolled. Parents reported 255 (58%) child participants' gender to be female, 184 (41%) male, three (<1%) other, and one (<1%) preferred not to report their child's gender. 400 (90%) children were White and the mean age was 9\u00b720 years (SD 1\u00b779). 85% of families for whom clinicians provided information in the treatment as usual group received CBT. OSI plus therapist support was non-inferior for parent-reported anxiety interference on the CAIS-P (SMD 0\u00b701, 95% CI -0\u00b715 to 0\u00b717; p<0\u00b70001) and all secondary outcomes. The mean difference in QALYs across trial arms approximated to zero, and OSI plus therapist support was associated with lower costs than treatment as usual. OSI plus therapist support was likely to be cost effective under certain scenarios, but uncertainty was high. OSI plus therapist support acceptability was good. No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Digitally augmented intervention brought promising savings without compromising outcomes and as such presents a valuable tool for increasing access to psychological therapies and meeting the demand for treatment of child anxiety problems.

        "abstract": "Given prior literature focused on the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease framework, there is strong rationale to hypothesize that reducing depression in the prenatal period will cause improvements in offspring cardiometabolic health. The current review outlines evidence that prenatal depression is associated with offspring cardiometabolic risk and health behaviors. We review evidence of these associations in humans and in nonhuman animals at multiple developmental periods, from the prenatal period (maternal preeclampsia, gestational diabetes), neonatal period (preterm birth, small size at birth), infancy (rapid weight gain), childhood and adolescence (high blood pressure, impaired glucose-insulin homeostasis, unfavorable lipid profiles, abdominal obesity), and into adulthood (diabetes, cardiovascular disease). In addition to these cardiometabolic outcomes, we focus on health behaviors associated with cardiometabolic risk, such as child eating behaviors, diet, physical activity, and sleep health. Our review focuses on child behaviors (e.g., emotional eating, preference for highly palatable foods, short sleep duration) and parenting behaviors (e.g., pressuring child to eat, modeling of health behaviors). These changes in health behaviors may be detected before changes to cardiometabolic outcomes, which may allow for early identification of and prevention for children at risk for poor adult cardiometabolic outcomes. We also discuss the methods of the ongoing Care Project, which is a randomized clinical trial to test whether reducing prenatal maternal depression improves offspring's cardiometabolic health and health behaviors in preschool. The goal of this review and the Care Project are to inform future research, interventions, and policies that support prenatal mental health and offspring cardiometabolic health.

        "title": "Clinical Implementation and Evaluation of Three Implementation Interventions for a Family-Oriented Care for Children of Mentally Ill Parents (ci-chimps): Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Multicenter Trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Germany, approximately three million children under the age of eighteen have a mentally ill parent. These children are at an increased risk of developing a mental illness themselves (1) as well as a physical illness (2). While research has identified numerous evidence-based family-oriented interventions, little is known about how to implement such interventions effectively and efficiently in clinical practice in Germany. This implementation study (ci-chimps) evaluates three clinical implementation projects with three different implementation interventions for the optimal implementation of the tailored family-oriented preventive and therapeutic interventions in the CHIMPS-NET (children of mentally ill parents-research network) with an implementation model for children of mentally ill parents. METHODS: A two-group randomized controlled multicenter trial will examine changes in family-oriented practice and aspects of implementation at baseline as well as at 12- and 24-months follow-up. The CHIMPS-Network consists of 20 clinical centers. The centers in the intervention group receive the support of all of the three implementation interventions: (1) optimal pathways to care, (2) education and a training program for professionals, and (3) systematic screening for children. The centers in the control group do not receive this specific implementation support. DISCUSSION: While we know that children of mentally ill parents are an important target group to be addressed by preventive and therapeutic interventions, there is often a lack of structured implementation of family-oriented interventions in clinical practice in Germany. Using a randomized controlled multicenter trial design with a large and wide-ranging sample (clinics for adult psychiatry and clinics for child and adolescent psychiatry, university clinics and clinics at the real health care) will provide a robust understanding of implementing family-oriented changes in German clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The CHIMPS-NET-study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register on 2019-12-19 (DRKS00020380) and with Clinical Trials on 2020-4-30 (NCT04369625), the ci-chimps-study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00026217) on 2021-08-27, the Clinical Trials registration is in review process.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cannabis use has been the most commonly used illicit psychoactive substance in India. Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.",

        "abstract": "Dependency on digital devices resulting in an ever-increasing daily screen time has subsequently also been the cause of several adverse effects on physical and mental or psychological health. Constant exposure to devices like smartphones, personal computers, and television can severely affect mental health- increase stress and anxiety, for example, and cause various sleep issues in both children as well as adults. Risk factors for obesity and cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, poor regulation of stress, low HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance are among the physical health repercussions we see. The psychological health effects comprise suicidal tendencies and symptoms of depression which are associated with digital device dependency, screen-time-induced poor sleep quality, and content-influenced negativity. Oftentimes it can cause the induction of a state of hyper-arousal, increase stress hormones, desynchronize the body clock or the circadian cycle, alter brain chemistry and create a drag on mental energy and development.

        "title": "Family Talk versus usual services in improving child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness (PRIMERA-Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parental mental illness is common and can lead to dependent children incurring a high risk of developing mental disorders, physical illness, and impaired educational and occupational outcomes. Family Talk is one of the better known interventions designed to prevent the intergenerational transmission of mental illness. However, its evidence base is small, with few robust independent randomised controlled trials, and no associated process or cost evaluations. The PRIMERA (Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children) research programme involves a mixed method evaluation of Family Talk which is being delivered in mental health settings in Ireland to improve child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness. METHODS: The study comprises a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT), with nested economic and process evaluations, to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness and implementation mechanisms of Family Talk compared to usual services. The study is being conducted in 15 adult and child mental health settings in Ireland. Families with a parent with mental illness, and children aged 5-18\u2009years (n\u2009=\u2009144 families) will be randomised to either the 7-session Family Talk programme (n\u2009=\u200996) or to standard care (n\u2009=\u200948) using a 2:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcomes are child psychosocial functioning and family functioning. Secondary outcomes are as follows: understanding and experience of parental mental illness, parental mental health, child and parental resilience, partner wellbeing and service utilisation. Blind assessments will take place at pre-intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Given the prevalence and burden of intergenerational mental illness, it is imperative that prevention through evidence-based interventions becomes a public health priority. The current study will provide an important contribution to the international evidence base for Family Talk whilst also helping to identify key implementation lessons in the scaling up of Family Talk, and other similar interventions, within routine mental health settings.

The increasing prevalence of mental disorders amongst adolescents makes promotion of mental well-being and prevention interventions at schools important. UPRIGHT (Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally implemented in schools to improve and promote mental Health for Teenagers) is designed as a whole school approach (school community, students and families) to promote a culture of mental well-being and prevent mental disorders by enhancing resilience capacities. The present article aims at describing the rationale, conceptual framework, as well as methodology of implementation and evaluation of the UPRIGHT intervention. METHODS: UPRIGHT project is a research and innovation project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement No. 754919 (Duration: 48\u2009months). The theoretical framework has been developed by an innovative and multidisciplinary approach using a co-creation process inside the UPRIGHT Consortium (involving seven institutions from Spain, Italy, Poland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland). Resulted is the UPRIGHT programme with 18 skills related to 4 components: Mindfulness, Coping, Efficacy and Social and Emotional Learning. Among the five Pan-European regions, 34 schools have been currently involved (17 control; 17 intervention) and around 6000 adolescents and their families are foreseen to participate along a 3-year period of evaluation. Effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated as a randomized controlled trial including quantitative and qualitative analysis in the five Pan-European regions representative of the cultural and socioeconomic diversity. The cost-effectiveness assessment will be performed by simulation modelling methods. DISCUSSION: We expect a short- to medium-term improvement of mental well-being in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities. The study may provide robust evidence on intrapersonal, familiar and social environmental resilience factors promoting positive mental well-being.

        "abstract": "Background Public health measures taken to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic can potentially impact the mental health of children. We assessed the prevalence and risk factors for childhood depression during the Covid-19 lockdown. Methods After 100 days of lockdown, we sent a survey questionnaire by WhatsApp to parents of school-aged children (5-16 years) in Chennai. The Short Mood and Feelings questionnaire was used as an objective screening tool to assess depression, with a score of 12 as the cut-off. Results There were 874 responses. The prevalence of childhood depression was 13.7%. Girls were more likely to be depressed than boys; 11-16-year-olds were more likely to be depressed than 5-10-year-old children. Children who had more than 4 hours online education had a higher likelihood of depression. Those who used a cell phone for online classes had a higher likelihood of depression compared to other devices, such as tabs or laptops. Children who slept less than 8 hours a day had a higher likelihood of depression while those who either did not sleep in the afternoon or slept less than 1 hour had a lower likelihood of depression. Children who were interacting with family over 1 hour per day had a lower likelihood of depression. Conclusion Overzealous online education, lack of adequate sleep and failure to spend quality time with the family can negatively impact the mental health of children. The impact of Covid-19 on the emotional health of children should be addressed by public health policy-makers and healthcare professionals.",

        "abstract": "Cannabis is one of the most commonly used and abused illicit drugs in the world today. The United States (US) currently has the highest annual prevalence rate of cannabis consumption in the world, 17.9% in individuals aged 12 or older, and it is on the rise. With increasing cannabis use comes the potential for an increase in abuse, and according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), approximately 5.1% of Americans had Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) in 2020. Research has shown that genetics and epigenetics play a significant role in cannabis use and CUD. In fact, approximately 50-70% of liability to CUD and 40-48% of cannabis use initiation have been found to be the result of genetic factors. Cannabis usage and CUD have also been linked to an increased risk of psychiatric disorders and Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) subsets like schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. Comprehension of the genetic and epigenetic aspects of cannabinoids is necessary for future research, treatment plans, and the production of pure cannabinoid compounds, which will be essential for FDA approval. In conclusion, having a better understanding of the epigenetic and genetic underpinnings of cannabis use, CUD, and the endocannabinoid system as a whole will aid in the development of effective FDA-approved treatment therapies and the advancement of personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Testing safety of Delta24-RGD (DNX-2401), an oncolytic adenovirus, locally delivered by convection enhanced delivery (CED) in tumor and surrounding brain of patients with recurrent glioblastoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dose-escalation phase I study with 3+3 cohorts, dosing 107 to 1 \u00d7 1011 viral particles (vp) in 20 patients. Besides clinical parameters, adverse events, and radiologic findings, blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain interstitial fluid, and excreta were sampled over time and analyzed for presence of immune response, viral replication, distribution, and shedding. RESULTS: Of 20 enrolled patients, 19 received the oncolytic adenovirus Delta24-RGD, which was found to be safe and feasible. Four patients demonstrated tumor response on MRI, one with complete regression and still alive after 8 years. Most serious adverse events were attributed to increased intracranial pressure caused by either an inflammatory reaction responding to steroid treatment or viral meningitis being transient and self-limiting. Often viral DNA concentrations in CSF increased over time, peaking after 2 to 4 weeks and remaining up to 3 months. Concomitantly Th1- and Th2-associated cytokine levels and numbers of CD3+ T and natural killer cells increased. Posttreatment tumor specimens revealed increased numbers of macrophages and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. No evidence of viral shedding in excreta was observed. CONCLUSIONS: CED of Delta24-RGD not only in the tumor but also in surrounding brain is safe, induces a local inflammatory reaction, and shows promising clinical responses.",

        "abstract": "Transmembrane proteins (TMEM) are located in the different biological membranes of the cell and have at least one passage through these cellular compartments. TMEM proteins carry out a wide variety of functions necessary to maintain cell homeostasis TMEM165 participates in glycosylation protein, TMEM88 in the development of cardiomyocytes, TMEM45A in epidermal keratinization, and TMEM74 regulating autophagy. However, for many TMEM proteins, their physiological function remains unknown. The role of these proteins is being recently investigated in cancer since transcriptomic and proteomic studies have revealed that exits differential expression of TMEM proteins in different neoplasms concerning cancer-free tissues. Among the cellular processes in which TMEM proteins have been involved in cancer are the promotion or suppression of cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, migration, intravasation/extravasation, metastasis, modulation of the immune response, and response to antineoplastic drugs. Inclusive data suggests that the participation of TMEM proteins in these cellular events could be carried out through involvement in different cell signaling pathways. However, the exact mechanisms not clear. This review shows a description of the involvement of TMEM proteins that promote or decrease cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in cancer cells, describes those TMEM proteins for which both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter role have been identified, depending on the type of cancer in which the protein is expressed. As well as some TMEM proteins involved in chemoresistance. A better characterization of these proteins is required to improve the understanding of the tumors in which their expression and function are altered; in addition to improving the understanding of the role of these proteins in cancer will show those TMEM proteins be potential candidates as biomarkers of response to chemotherapy or prognostic biomarkers or as potential therapeutic targets in cancer.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AIMS: The targeting of solid cancers with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells faces many technological hurdles, including selection of optimal target antigens. Promising pre-clinical and clinical data of CAR T-cell activity have emerged from targeting surface antigens such as GD2 and B7H3 in childhood cancer neuroblastoma. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is expressed in a majority of neuroblastomas at low antigen density but is largely absent from healthy tissues. METHODS: To explore an alternate target antigen for neuroblastoma CAR T-cell therapy, the authors generated and screened a single-chain variable fragment library targeting ALK extracellular domain to make a panel of new anti-ALK CAR T-cell constructs. RESULTS: A lead novel CAR T-cell construct was capable of specific cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma cells expressing low levels of ALK, but with only weak cytokine and proliferative T-cell responses. To explore strategies for amplifying ALK CAR T cells, the authors generated a co-CAR approach in which T cells received signal 1 from a first-generation ALK construct and signal 2 from anti-B7H3 or GD2 chimeric co-stimulatory receptors. The co-CAR approach successfully demonstrated the ability to avoid targeting single-antigen-positive targets as a strategy for mitigating on-target off-tumor toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further proof of concept for ALK as a neuroblastoma CAR T-cell target.",

Oncolytic viral therapy has been evaluated in patients with pediatric gliomas elsewhere in the brain, but data regarding oncolytic viral therapy in patients with DIPG are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, dose-escalation study of DNX-2401, an oncolytic adenovirus that selectively replicates in tumor cells, in patients with newly diagnosed DIPG. The patients received a single virus infusion through a catheter placed in the cerebellar peduncle, followed by radiotherapy. The primary objective was to assess the safety and adverse-event profile of DNX-2401. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of DNX-2401 on overall survival and quality of life, to determine the percentage of patients who have an objective response, and to collect tumor-biopsy and peripheral-blood samples for correlative studies of the molecular features of DIPG and antitumor immune responses. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients, 3 to 18 years of age, with newly diagnosed DIPG received 1\u00d710 CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral infusion of oncolytic virus DNX-2401 followed by radiotherapy in pediatric patients with DIPG resulted in changes in T-cell activity and a reduction in or stabilization of tumor size in some patients but was associated with adverse events.

        "abstract": "Human livelihood highly depends on applying different sources of energy whose utilization is associated with air pollution. On the other hand, air pollution may be associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Unlike other environmental causes of cancer (e.g., irradiation), air pollution cannot efficiently be controlled by geographical borders, regulations, and policies. The unavoidable exposure to air pollution can modify cancer incidence and mortality. GBM treatment with chemotherapy or even its surgical removal has proven insufficient (100% recurrence rate; patient's survival mean of 15 months; 90% fatality within five years) due to glioma infiltrative and migratory capacities. Given the barrage of attention and research investments currently plowed into next-generation cancer therapy, oncolytic viruses are perhaps the most vigorously pursued. Provision of an insight into the current state of the research and future direction is essential for stimulating new ideas with the potentials of filling research gaps. This review manuscript aims to overview types of brain cancer, their burden, and different causative agents. It also describes why air pollution is becoming a concerning factor. The different opinions on the association of air pollution with brain cancer are reviewed. It tries to address the significant controversy in this field by hypothesizing the air-pollution-brain-cancer association via inflammation and atopic conditions. The last section of this review deals with the oncolytic viruses, which have been used in, or are still under clinical trials for GBM treatment. Engineered adenoviruses (i.e., DNX-2401, DNX-2440, CRAd8-S-pk7 loaded Neural stem cells), herpes simplex virus type 1 (i.e., HSV-1 C134, HSV-1 rQNestin34.5v.2, HSV-1 G207, HSV-1 M032), measles virus (i.e., MV-CEA), parvovirus (i.e., ParvOryx), poliovirus (i.e., Poliovirus PVSRIPO), reovirus (i.e., pelareorep), moloney murine leukemia virus (i.e., Toca 511 vector), and vaccinia virus (i.e., vaccinia virus TG6002) as possible life-changing alleviations for GBM have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first review that comprehensively discusses both (i) the negative/positive association of air pollution with GBM; and (ii) the application of oncolytic viruses for GBM, including the most recent advances and clinical trials. It is also the first review that addresses the controversies over air pollution and brain cancer association. We believe that the article will significantly appeal to a broad readership of virologists, oncologists, neurologists, environmentalists, and those who work in the field of (bio)energy. Policymakers may also use it to establish better health policies and regulations about air pollution and (bio)fuels exploration, production, and consumption.",

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) is a relatively new treatment for pediatric leukemia and has been the focus of recent advancements. CAR is manufactured to express T cells through various ways such as using retroviruses, transposons and transposase, electroporation, and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Together, it provides flexibility since it recognizes proteins without the need of antigen processing and presentation, can recognize carbohydrates and lipids, and it has been proven to be cost-effective. Despite these benefits however, problems faced by this therapy include unrecognized tumor proteins possibly escaping the system, CAR T cell expression being transient, and the therapy being one of the most expensive cancer drug ever approved. As a result, recent progress has been ongoing where researchers have combined CAR-T cells with natural killer (NK) cells and different cytokines to maximize its efficacy and potency while limiting potential risks such as cytokine release syndrome. Consequently, these cells gained the ability to be universal-being able to be used to treat multiple patients, maintain viability for a longer period, and prevent relapse.",

        "abstract": "Given prior literature focused on the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease framework, there is strong rationale to hypothesize that reducing depression in the prenatal period will cause improvements in offspring cardiometabolic health. The current review outlines evidence that prenatal depression is associated with offspring cardiometabolic risk and health behaviors. We review evidence of these associations in humans and in nonhuman animals at multiple developmental periods, from the prenatal period (maternal preeclampsia, gestational diabetes), neonatal period (preterm birth, small size at birth), infancy (rapid weight gain), childhood and adolescence (high blood pressure, impaired glucose-insulin homeostasis, unfavorable lipid profiles, abdominal obesity), and into adulthood (diabetes, cardiovascular disease). In addition to these cardiometabolic outcomes, we focus on health behaviors associated with cardiometabolic risk, such as child eating behaviors, diet, physical activity, and sleep health. Our review focuses on child behaviors (e.g., emotional eating, preference for highly palatable foods, short sleep duration) and parenting behaviors (e.g., pressuring child to eat, modeling of health behaviors). These changes in health behaviors may be detected before changes to cardiometabolic outcomes, which may allow for early identification of and prevention for children at risk for poor adult cardiometabolic outcomes. We also discuss the methods of the ongoing Care Project, which is a randomized clinical trial to test whether reducing prenatal maternal depression improves offspring's cardiometabolic health and health behaviors in preschool. The goal of this review and the Care Project are to inform future research, interventions, and policies that support prenatal mental health and offspring cardiometabolic health.

        "abstract": "Sarcomas are a diverse group of bone and soft tissue tumors that account for over 10% of childhood cancers. Outcomes are particularly poor for children with refractory, relapsed, or metastatic disease. Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cells are an exciting form of adoptive cell therapy that potentially offers new hope for these children. In early trials, promising outcomes have been achieved in some pediatric patients with sarcoma. However, many children do not derive benefit despite significant expression of the targeted tumor antigen. The success of CAR T cell therapy in sarcomas and other solid tumors is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we provide an update of the CAR T cell therapies that are currently being tested in pediatric sarcoma clinical trials, including those targeting tumors that express HER2, NY-ESO, GD2, EGFR, GPC3, B7-H3, and MAGE-A4. We also outline promising new CAR T cells that are in pre-clinical development. Finally, we discuss strategies that are being used to overcome tumor-mediated immunosuppression in solid tumors; these strategies have the potential to improve clinical outcomes of CAR T cell therapy for children with sarcoma.",

        "abstract": "The potential health effects of exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) remain largely unexplored. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

        "title": "Digitally augmented, parent-led CBT versus treatment as usual for child anxiety problems in child mental health services in England and Northern Ireland: a pragmatic, non-inferiority, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety problems are common in children, yet few affected children access evidence-based treatment. Digitally augmented psychological therapies bring potential to increase availability of effective help for children with mental health problems. This study aimed to establish whether therapist-supported, digitally augmented, parent-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could increase the efficiency of treatment without compromising clinical effectiveness and acceptability. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, unblinded, two-arm, multisite, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapist-supported, parent-led CBT using the Online Support and Intervention (OSI) for child anxiety platform compared with treatment as usual for child (aged 5-12 years) anxiety problems in 34 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in England and Northern Ireland. We examined acceptability of OSI plus therapist support via qualitative interviews. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OSI plus therapist support or treatment as usual, minimised by child age, gender, service type, and baseline child anxiety interference. Outcomes were assessed at week 14 and week 26 after randomisation. The primary clinical outcome was parent-reported interference caused by child anxiety at week 26 assessment, using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale-parent report (CAIS-P). The primary measure of health economic effect was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Outcome analyses were conducted blind in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with a standardised non-inferiority margin of 0\u00b733 for clinical analyses. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, 12890382. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2020, and Aug 3, 2022, 706 families (706 children and their parents or carers) were referred to the study information. 444 families were enrolled. Parents reported 255 (58%) child participants' gender to be female, 184 (41%) male, three (<1%) other, and one (<1%) preferred not to report their child's gender. 400 (90%) children were White and the mean age was 9\u00b720 years (SD 1\u00b779). 85% of families for whom clinicians provided information in the treatment as usual group received CBT. OSI plus therapist support was non-inferior for parent-reported anxiety interference on the CAIS-P (SMD 0\u00b701, 95% CI -0\u00b715 to 0\u00b717; p<0\u00b70001) and all secondary outcomes. The mean difference in QALYs across trial arms approximated to zero, and OSI plus therapist support was associated with lower costs than treatment as usual. OSI plus therapist support was likely to be cost effective under certain scenarios, but uncertainty was high. OSI plus therapist support acceptability was good. No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Digitally augmented intervention brought promising savings without compromising outcomes and as such presents a valuable tool for increasing access to psychological therapies and meeting the demand for treatment of child anxiety problems.

        "abstract": "Several years ago, dozens of cases were described in patients with symptoms very similar to mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). This new disease entity was described as mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome (MPSPS). The name of the disease indicates that in addition to the typical symptoms of conventional MPS, patients develop other features such as congenital heart defects and kidney and hematopoietic system disorders. The symptoms are highly advanced, and patients usually do not survive past the second year of life. MPSPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a homozygous-specific mutation in the gene encoding the VPS33A protein. To date, it has been described in 41 patients. Patients with MPSPS exhibited excessive excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the urine and exceptionally high levels of heparan sulfate in the plasma, but the accumulation of substrates is not caused by a decrease in the activity of any lysosomal enzymes. Here, we discuss the pathomechanisms and symptoms of MPSPS, comparing them to those of MPS. Moreover, we asked the question whether MPSPS should be classified as a type of MPS or a separate disease, as contrary to 'classical' MPS types, despite GAG accumulation, no defects in lysosomal enzymes responsible for degradation of these compounds could be detected in MPSPS. The molecular mechanism of the appearance of GAG accumulation in MPSPS is suggested on the basis of results available in the literature.",

Logistic regression and BKMR models were employed to evaluate the association between REEs and risk of MetS. RESULTS: Although REEs were not significantly associated with MetS, certain elements such as La, Pr, and Nd were negatively associated with abdominal obesity, whereas Ce, Pr, Nd, and Dy were positively associated with hypertension. BKMR models suggested a U-shaped relationship between mixed REEs and MetS, with varying effects on abdominal obesity and high blood pressure.

        "abstract": "The present study examined genetic, prenatal, and postnatal environmental pathways in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and depressive symptoms from parents to early adolescents (when these symptoms start to increase), while considering timing effects of exposure to parent anxiety and depressive symptoms postnatally. The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

One of its severe effects is sub-fertility. The exact reason for endometriosis is still unknown and under investigation. Tracking the symptoms is not sufficient for diagnosing the disease. A successful diagnosis can only be made using laparoscopy. During the disease, the amount of some molecules (i.e., proteins, antigens) changes in the blood. Raman spectroscopy provides information about biochemicals without using dyes or external labels. In this study, Raman spectroscopy is used as a non-invasive diagnostic method for endometriosis. The Raman spectra of 94 serum samples acquired from 49 patients and 45 healthy individuals were compared for this study. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), k- Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used in the analysis. According to the results (using 80 measurements for training and 14 measurements for the test set), it was found that kNN-weighted gave the best classification model with sensitivity and specificity values of 80.5% and 89.7%, respectively. Testing the model with unseen data yielded a sensitivity value of 100% and a specificity value of 100%.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its accurate and timely diagnosis is hindered by vague symptoms and the urgent necessity for early antibiotic intervention. The gold standard for diagnosing the condition is the identification of a pathogenic organism from normally sterile sites via laboratory testing. However, this method is resource-intensive and cannot be conducted continuously. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to predict the onset of late-onset sepsis (LOS) with good diagnostic value as early as possible using non-invasive biosignal measurements from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) monitors. METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study, we developed a multimodal machine learning algorithm based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure that uses the power spectral density (PSD) of recorded biosignals to predict the onset of LOS. This approach aimed to discern LOS-related pathogenic spectral signatures without labor-intensive manual artifact removal. RESULTS: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic score of 0.810 (95\u00a0% CI 0.698-0.922) on the validation dataset. With an optimal operating point, LOS detection had 83\u00a0% sensitivity and 73\u00a0% specificity. The median early detection was 44\u00a0h before clinical suspicion. The results highlighted the additive importance of electrocardiogram and respiratory impedance (RESP) signals in improving predictive accuracy. According to a more detailed analysis, the predictive power arose from the morphology of the electrocardiogram's R-wave and sudden changes in the RESP signal. CONCLUSION: Raw biosignals from NICU monitors, in conjunction with PSD transformation, as input to the CNN, can provide state-of-the-art prediction performance for LOS without the need for artifact removal. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to highlight the independent and additive predictive potential of electrocardiogram R-wave morphology and concurrent, sudden changes in the RESP waveform in predicting the onset of LOS using non-invasive biosignals.",

Movement and Posture was the most frequently reported outcome category, followed by Safety, however Quality of Life, and various prevalent comorbidities and complications of CP were infrequently reported. Notably, many outcome instruments used do not have evaluative properties and thus are not suitable for measuring change following intervention. We provide a number of recommendations to ensure that future trials generate high-quality outcome data that is aligned with the priorities of the CP community.",

However, for many TMEM proteins, their physiological function remains unknown. The role of these proteins is being recently investigated in cancer since transcriptomic and proteomic studies have revealed that exits differential expression of TMEM proteins in different neoplasms concerning cancer-free tissues. Among the cellular processes in which TMEM proteins have been involved in cancer are the promotion or suppression of cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, migration, intravasation/extravasation, metastasis, modulation of the immune response, and response to antineoplastic drugs. Inclusive data suggests that the participation of TMEM proteins in these cellular events could be carried out through involvement in different cell signaling pathways. However, the exact mechanisms not clear. This review shows a description of the involvement of TMEM proteins that promote or decrease cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in cancer cells, describes those TMEM proteins for which both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter role have been identified, depending on the type of cancer in which the protein is expressed. As well as some TMEM proteins involved in chemoresistance. A better characterization of these proteins is required to improve the understanding of the tumors in which their expression and function are altered; in addition to improving the understanding of the role of these proteins in cancer will show those TMEM proteins be potential candidates as biomarkers of response to chemotherapy or prognostic biomarkers or as potential therapeutic targets in cancer.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mortality rate for children with septic shock is stil quite high in low-income and middle-income countries (31.7%). One of the most widely used scoring systems to assess mortality in sepsis or septic shock is Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD-2). However, it requires various laboratory evaluations. A non-invasive, fast and easy method is needed to assess the mortality of children with septic shock at an early stage. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the ability of Vascular Reactivity Index (VRI) compared with PELOD-2 score as a predictor of mortality in children with septic shock based on vascular response to vasoactive agents. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from children aged 1\u2009month to 18 years with septic shock treated in the ER and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the tertiary hospital from 2017 to 2021. The serial haemodynamic data were analysed including Systemic Vascular Resistant Index (SVRI) and the cardiac index from ultrasound cardiac output monitoring device was recorded in the first and sixth hours after the diagnosis of septic shock. The VRI was determined by dividing SVRI/Vasoactive Inotropic Score (ie, accumulated doses of dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, milrinone, vasopressin and norepinephrine). The receiver operating curve was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off point. RESULTS: A total of 68 subjects fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the median age was 54 months with a range of 2-204 months and the mortality rate was 47%. The majority of the patients who died were found in the high cardiac index and low SVRI group (17.6%). Moreover, the optimum cut-off point of VRI was obtained to predict mortality in septic shock of 32.1, with 87.5% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. The AUC for predicting death using VRI was 95% (95% CI 90% to 100%, p<0.001) and PELOD-2 92.6% (95% CI 96.4% to 98.8%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The VRI <32.1\u2009may potentially be used to predict mortality in children with septic shock and its predictive ability is as good as PELOD-2. The assessment of VRI is faster and easier than PELOD-2.",

METHODS: Single-center, retrospective cohort study in children with a diagnosis of sepsis visiting the PED and then admitted to the PICU from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019. Sepsis organ dysfunction scores-pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) (Schlapbach, Matics, Shime), quickSOFA, quickSOFA-L, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD)-2, quickPELOD-2, and Pediatric Multiple Organ Dysfunction score-were calculated during the first 24 hours of admission (day 1) and their performance compared with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and severe sepsis-International Consensus Conference on Pediatric Sepsis(ICCPS)-derived criteria-using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Primary outcome was PICU mortality. Secondary outcomes were: a composite of death and new disability (ie, change from baseline Pediatric Overall Performance Category score \u22651); prolonged PICU length of stay (>5 d); prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) (>3 d). RESULTS: Among 60 patients with sepsis, 4 (6.7%) died, 7 (11.7%) developed new disability, 26 (43.3%) experienced prolonged length of stay, and 21 (35%) prolonged invasive MV. The prognostic ability in mortality discrimination was significantly higher for organ dysfunction scores, with PELOD-2 showing the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.924; 95% confidence interval, 0.837-1.000), significantly better than SIRS 3 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P = 0.009), SIRS 4 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P < 0.001), and severe sepsis (0.924 vs 0.527, P < 0.001). Among secondary outcomes, PELOD-2 performed significantly better than SIRS criteria and severe sepsis to predict prolonged duration of invasive MV, whereas better than severe sepsis to predict \"poor outcome\" (mortality or new disability). CONCLUSIONS: Day 1 organ dysfunction scores performed better in predicting mortality and morbidity outcomes than ICCPS-derived criteria.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate diagnostic biomarkers and immune cell infiltration in pediatric sepsis. METHODS: Three datasets (GSE13904, GSE26378, and GSE26440) were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. After identifying overlapping genes in differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and modular sepsis genes selected via a weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) in the GSE26378 dataset, pivotal genes were further identified by using LASSO regression and random forest analysis to construct a diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to validate the efficacy of the diagnostic model for pediatric sepsis. Furthermore, we used qRT-PCR to detect the expression levels of pivotal genes and validate the diagnostic model's ability to diagnose pediatric sepsis in 65 actual clinical samples. RESULTS: Among 294 overlapping genes of DEGs and modular sepsis genes, five pivotal genes (STOM, MS4A4A, CD177, MMP8, and MCEMP1) were screened to construct a diagnostic model of pediatric sepsis. The expression of the five pivotal genes was higher in the sepsis group than in the normal group. The diagnostic model showed good diagnostic ability with AUCs of 1, 0.986, and 0.968. More importantly, the diagnostic model showed good diagnostic ability with AUCs of 0.937 in the 65 clinical samples and showed better efficacy compared to conventional inflammatory indicators such as procalcitonin (PCT), white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and neutrophil percentage (NEU%).

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population.

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis remains one of the leading causes of mortality in newborns. Several brainstem-regulated physiological processes undergo disruption during neonatal sepsis. Mechanistic knowledge gaps exist at the interplay between metabolism and immune activation to brainstem neural circuits and pertinent physiological functions in neonates. To delineate this association, we induced systemic inflammation either by TLR4 (LPS) or TLR1/2 (PAM3CSK4) ligand administration in postnatal day 5 mice (PD5). Our findings show that LPS and PAM3CSK4 evoke substantial changes in respiration and metabolism. Physiological trade-offs led to hypometabolic-hypothermic responses due to LPS, but not PAM3CSK4, whereas to both TLR ligands blunted respiratory chemoreflexes. Neuroinflammatory pathways modulation in brainstem showed more robust effects in LPS than PAM3CSK4. Brainstem neurons, microglia, and astrocyte gene expression analyses showed unique responses to TLR ligands. PAM3CSK4 did not significantly modulate gene expression changes in GLAST-1 positive brainstem astrocytes. PD5 pups receiving PAM3CSK4 failed to maintain a prolonged metabolic state repression, which correlated to enhanced gasping latency and impaired autoresuscitation during anoxic chemoreflex challenges. In contrast, LPS administered pups showed no significant changes in anoxic chemoreflex. Electrophysiological studies from brainstem slices prepared from pups exposed to either TLR4 or PAM3CSK4 showed compromised transmission between preB\u00f6tzinger complex and Hypoglossal as an exclusive response to the TLR1/2 ligand. Spatial gene expression analysis demonstrated a region-specific modulation of PAM3CSK4 within the raphe nucleus relative to other anatomical sites evaluated.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Overrepresentation analysis (ORA) is used widely to assess the enrichment of functional categories in a gene list compared to a background list. ORA is therefore a critical method in the interpretation of 'omics data, relating gene lists to biological functions and themes. Although ORA is hugely popular, we and others have noticed two potentially undesired behaviours of some ORA tools. The first one we call the 'background problem', because it involves the software eliminating large numbers of genes from the background list if they are not annotated as belonging to any category. The second one we call the 'false discovery rate problem', because some tools underestimate the true number of parallel tests conducted. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate the impact of these issues on several real RNA-seq datasets and use simulated RNA-seq data to quantify the impact of these problems. We show that the severity of these problems depends on the gene set library, the number of genes in the list, and the degree of noise in the dataset. These problems can be mitigated by changing packages/websites for ORA or by changing to another approach such as functional class scoring. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: An R/Shiny tool has been provided at https://oratool.ziemann-lab.net/ and the supporting materials are available from Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/13823301).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transmembrane (TMEM) protein genes are a class of proteins that spans membranes and function to many physiological processes. However, there is very little known about TMEM gene expression, especially in cancer tissue. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequence may facilitate the understanding of this poorly characterized protein genes in PDAC. METHODS: We selected the TMEM family genes through the Human Protein Atlas and characterized their expression by single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. Identification of the key TMEM genes was performed through three machine learning algorithms: LASSO, SVM-RFE and RF-SRC. Then, we established TMEM gene riskscore and estimate its implication in predicting survival and response to systematic therapy. Additionally, we explored the difference and impact of TMEM gene expression in PDAC through immunohistochemistry and cell line research. RESULTS: 5 key TMEM genes (ANO1, TMEM59, TMEM204, TMEM205, TMEM92) were selected based on the single-cell analysis and machine learning survival outcomes. Patients stratified into the high and low-risk groups based on TMEM riskscore, were observed with distinct overall survival in internal and external datasets. Moreover, through bulk RNA-sequence and immunohistochemical staining we verified the protein expression of TMEM genes in PDAC and revealed TMEM92 as an essential regulator of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSION: Our study on TMEM gene expression and behavior in PDAC has revealed unique characteristics, offering potential for precise therapeutic approaches. Insights into molecular mechanisms expand understanding of PDAC complexity and TMEM gene roles. Such knowledge may inform targeted therapy development, benefiting patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide expression profiles have been previously employed as clinical research diagnostic tools for newborn sepsis. We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Sepsis recognition is a clinical challenge in children. We aim to determine whether peripheral blood gene expression profiles are associated with pathogen type and sepsis severity in children with suspected sepsis. METHODS: This was a prospective pilot observational study in a tertiary pediatric emergency department with a convenience sample of children enrolled. Participants were older than 56 days and younger than 18 years, had suspected sepsis, and had not received broad-spectrum antibiotics in the previous 4 hours. Primary outcome was source pathogen, defined as confirmed bacterial source from sterile body fluid or confirmed viral source. Secondary outcome was sepsis severity, defined as maximum therapy required for shock reversal in the first 3 hospital days. We drew peripheral blood for ribonucleic acid isolation at the sepsis protocol activation, obtained gene expression measures with the GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array, and conducted differential expression analysis. RESULTS: We collected ribonucleic acid samples from a convenience sample of 122 children with suspected sepsis and 12 healthy controls. We compared the 66 children (54%) with confirmed bacterial or viral infection and found 558 differentially expressed genes, many related to interferon signaling or viral immunity. We did not find statistically significant gene expression differences in patients according to sepsis severity. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates feasibility of evaluating gene expression profiling data in children evaluated for sepsis in the pediatric emergency department setting. Our results suggest that gene expression profiling may facilitate identification of source pathogen in children with suspected sepsis, which could ultimately lead to improved tailoring of sepsis treatment and antimicrobial stewardship.",

The purpose of the present study was to identify candidate genes of preterm infants who are susceptible to RSV infection and provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of RSV infection. METHODS: Three datasets (GSE77087, GSE69606 and GSE41374) containing 183 blood samples of RSV infected patients and 33 blood samples of healthy controls from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were downloaded and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out. The function and pathway enrichments were analyzed through Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for DEGs was constructed through Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). The module analysis was performed by Cytoscape software and hub genes were identified. Clinical verification was employed to verify the expression level of top five hub genes among 72 infants including 50 RSV infected patients and 22 non-RSV-infected patients hospitalized in our center. Further, the RSV infected infants with high-expression IFI27 and those with low-expression IFI27 were compared (defined as higher or lower than the median mRNA level). Finally, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) focusing on IFI27 was carried out. RESULTS: Totally, 4028 DEGs were screened out and among which, 131 most significant DEGs were selected. Subsequently, 13 hub genes were identified, and function and pathway enrichments of hub genes mainly were: response to virus, defense response to virus, regulation of viral genome replication and regulation of viral life cycle. Furthermore, IFI27 was confirmed to be the most significantly expressed in clinical verification. Gene sets associated with calcium signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix receptor interaction and so on were significantly enriched when IFI27 was highly expressed. Moreover, high-expression IFI27 was associated with more severe cases (p\u2009=\u20090.041), more requirements of mechanical ventilation (p\u2009=\u20090.034), more frequent hospitalization (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and longer cumulative hospital stay (p\u2009=\u20090.012). CONCLUSION: IFI27 might serve to predict RSV infection and evaluate the severity of RSV infection in preterm infants.",

TMEM proteins carry out a wide variety of functions necessary to maintain cell homeostasis TMEM165 participates in glycosylation protein, TMEM88 in the development of cardiomyocytes, TMEM45A in epidermal keratinization, and TMEM74 regulating autophagy. However, for many TMEM proteins, their physiological function remains unknown. The role of these proteins is being recently investigated in cancer since transcriptomic and proteomic studies have revealed that exits differential expression of TMEM proteins in different neoplasms concerning cancer-free tissues. Among the cellular processes in which TMEM proteins have been involved in cancer are the promotion or suppression of cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, migration, intravasation/extravasation, metastasis, modulation of the immune response, and response to antineoplastic drugs. Inclusive data suggests that the participation of TMEM proteins in these cellular events could be carried out through involvement in different cell signaling pathways. However, the exact mechanisms not clear. This review shows a description of the involvement of TMEM proteins that promote or decrease cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in cancer cells, describes those TMEM proteins for which both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter role have been identified, depending on the type of cancer in which the protein is expressed. As well as some TMEM proteins involved in chemoresistance. A better characterization of these proteins is required to improve the understanding of the tumors in which their expression and function are altered; in addition to improving the understanding of the role of these proteins in cancer will show those TMEM proteins be potential candidates as biomarkers of response to chemotherapy or prognostic biomarkers or as potential therapeutic targets in cancer.",

However, while clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been conducted in recent years, the results have not always been favorable.

Moreover, case reports pertaining to patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis carrying FUS and C9orf72 mutations who received antisense oligonucleotide-based treatments have demonstrated a notable reduction in the targeted protein (thus providing the proof of mechanism) but with no discernible clinical benefits. There are several possible reasons why antisense oligonucleotides knockdown fails to achieve proof of concept, which need to be addressed: on-target adverse effects resulting from the loss of function of target gene and irreversible neuronal death cascade due to toxic protein accumulation, among other factors.

        "abstract": "The potential health effects of exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) remain largely unexplored. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "The effect of cytokines on non-traditional immunological targets under conditions of chronic inflammation is an ongoing subject of study. Fatigue is a symptom often associated with autoimmune diseases. Chronic inflammatory response and activated cell-mediated immunity are associated with cardiovascular myopathies which can be driven by muscle weakness and fatigue. Thus, we hypothesize that immune dysfunction-driven changes in myocyte mitochondria may play a critical role in fatigue-related pathogenesis. We show that persistent low-level expression of IFN-\u03b3 in designated IFN-\u03b3 AU-Rich Element deletion mice (ARE mice) under androgen exposure resulted in mitochondrial and metabolic deficiencies in myocytes from male or castrated ARE mice. Most notably, echocardiography unveiled that low ejection fraction in the left ventricle post-stress correlated with mitochondrial deficiencies, explaining how heart function decreases under stress. We report that inefficiencies and structural changes in mitochondria, with changes to expression of mitochondrial genes, are linked to male-biased fatigue and acute cardiomyopathy under stress. Our work highlights how male androgen hormone backgrounds and active autoimmunity reduce mitochondrial function and the ability to cope with stress and how pharmacological blockade of stress signal protects heart function. These studies provide new insight into the diverse actions of IFN-\u03b3 in fatigue, energy metabolism, and autoimmunity. \u00a9 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

        "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are rare lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) characterized by the excessive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Conventional MPS, caused by inborn deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes involved in GAG degradation, display various multisystemic symptoms-including progressive neurological complications, ophthalmological disorders, hearing loss, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary issues, cardiorespiratory problems, bone and joint abnormalities, dwarfism, and coarse facial features. Mucopolysaccharidosis-Plus Syndrome (MPSPS), an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the endo-lysosomal tethering protein VPS33A, shows additional renal and hematopoietic abnormalities (\"Plus symptoms\") uncommon in conventional MPS. Here, we analyze data from biochemical, histological, and physical examinations-particularly of blood counts and kidney function-to further characterize the clinical phenotype of MPSPS. A series of blood tests indicate hematopoietic symptoms including progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia, which correlate with histological observations of hypoplastic bone marrow. High urinary excretion of protein (caused by impairments in renal filtration), hypoalbuminemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, cholesterol, and uric acid indicate renal dysfunction. Histological analyses of MPSPS kidneys similarly suggest the extensive destruction of glomerular structures by foamy podocytes. Height and weight did not significantly deviate from the average, but in some cases, growth began to decline at around six months or one year of age.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aging is a complex and gradual biological process that represents the major risk factor with respect to the development of chronic degenerative diseases, often associated with disability. Diet and nu-trition, coupled with proper physical activity have a significant impact on the health status of the elderly with a decreased risk of disease being indicative of successful aging. Musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia are the most frequently reported disorders among the elderly community. METHODS: This study presents a systematic review of the literature on the potential benefits of several nutra-ceuticals in promoting healthy aging and in reducing the risk of chronic diseases in elderly individuals. RESULTS: Dietary components including vitamins (vitamin C, B vitamin and vitamin K) flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, anthocyanins, and isoflavones), minerals (e.g., magnesium, zinc and potassium) and other nutrients such phytoestrogens, amino acids, and omega-3 fatty acids help in slowing the aging process, which ultimately results in increased lifespan and longevity. CONCLUSIONS: This paper highlights the key nutrients and phytochemicals of nutraceutical importance for the healthy aging of the elderly population. Although the scientific literature provides evidences of therapeutic effectiveness of nutraceuticals, more in-depth clinical investigations are needed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High rates of maternal mortality and intimate partner violence (IPV) are both major worldwide health challenges. Evidence from single-country samples suggests that IPV may be an important risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services, but there is little large-scale evidence on this association. This paper evaluates whether IPV is a risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services in a large cross-country sample, and also compiles evidence on the relative effects of different forms of IPV. METHODS: We analyze the association between intimate partner violence\u00a0and utilization of maternal health care, using a dataset compiling all Demographic and Health Surveys that report data on intimate partner violence. Using data on 166,685 women observed in 36 countries between 2005 and 2016, we estimate logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between lifetime experience of IPV and utilization of antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery care, and postnatal care. We estimate both unadjusted models and models adjusted for geographic and sociodemographic characteristics that are generally correlated with utilization of maternal health care (including age, education, number of children, wealth status, marital status, and urbanity). RESULTS: Lifetime experience of any IPV is associated with decreased use of maternal health services in a broad sample of births observed in lower and middle-income countries: in particular, the utilization of four or more ANC visits, the number of ANC visits, and the utilization of facility care at birth. This association remains statistically significant even after adjusting for country of residence, subnational region of residence, and additional individual-level covariates; however, there is no statistically significant association between experience of any IPV and postnatal care. The only form of IPV significantly associated with care utilization is physical IPV. CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing physical intimate partner violence show lower levels of utilization of maternal health services in a large sample of developing and middle-income countries. Given that reduced utilization of maternal health services is correlated with maternal and neonatal health outcomes, this pattern suggests that IPV prevention may be an important component of interventions targeting enhanced maternal and neonatal health.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death among women with nonmetastatic breast cancer. Whether exercise is associated with reductions in CVD risk in patients with breast cancer with an elevated CVD risk phenotype is not known. METHODS: Using a prospective design, women (n = 2,973; mean age, 57 years) diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer participating in two registry-based, regional cohort studies, completed a questionnaire that assessed leisure-time recreational physical activity (metabolic equivalent task [MET]-h/wk). The primary end point was the first occurrence of any of the following: new diagnosis of coronary artery disease, heart failure, valve abnormality, arrhythmia, stroke, or CVD death, occurring after study enrollment. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 8.6 years (range, 0.2 to 14.8 years). In multivariable analysis, the incidence of cardiovascular events decreased across increasing total MET-h/wk categories (Ptrend < .001). Compared with < 2 MET-h/wk, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.09) for 2 to 10.9 MET-h/wk, 0.79 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.96) for 11 to 24.5 MET-h/wk, and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.80) for \u2265 24.5 MET-h/wk. Similar trends were observed for the incidence of coronary artery disease and heart failure (P values < .05). Adherence to national exercise guidelines for adult patients with cancer (ie, \u2265 9 MET-h/wk) was associated with an adjusted 23% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events in comparison with not meeting the guidelines (< 9 MET-h/wk; P < .001). The association with exercise did not differ according to age, CVD risk factors, menopausal status, or anticancer treatment. CONCLUSION: Exercise is associated with substantial, graded reductions in the incidence of cardiovascular events in women with nonmetastatic breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "France has been identified with one of the highest rates of cannabis consumption of Western European countries. Yet we lack data in medical students who are at risk of addictive behavior. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of cannabis consumption and cannabis use disorder (CUD) among French medical students and their association with psychotropic drug consumption and psychosocial factors. Medical students were recruited from 35 French universities of medicine through administration mailing lists and social networks, between December 2016 and May 2017. Cannabis consumption was self-declared by anonymous questionnaire and CUD was defined by a Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) score\u2009\u2265\u20093. 10,985 medical students with a mean age of 21.8\u00a0years (\u00b1\u20093.3) were included, 32% of which were men. Overall, 1642 [14.9 (14.3; 15.6)%] reported cannabis consumption and 622 [5.7 (5.2; 6.1)%] students were identified with CUD at screening. Men were at two-time higher risk of cannabis consumption and three-time higher risk of CUD (22.4% and 10.6% for men vs. 11.5% and 3.4%, respectively, for women). In multivariate analyses, men sex, alcohol use disorder, tobacco smoking, parents' divorce, and history of physical assault and lower rates of lower rates of\u2009\u2265\u200940 weekly worked hours were identified as common associated factors for cannabis consumption and CUD. Hypnotic consumption, psychiatric follow-up, and history of sexual assault were identified as factors associated specifically with CUD, suggesting that these factors were associated with more severe cannabis consumption. Only 17% of students identified with CUD reported a psychiatric follow-up. Altogether, these results suggest that health policies should target cannabis consumption in medical students that is frequent, especially in men, with low rates of psychiatric follow-up. We have identified psychological factors and increased hypnotic drug consumption in CUD participants suggesting that psychiatric follow-up should be systematically proposed to this group.",

We performed an external validation of the quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2, including its performance in predicting mortality in specific age groups. DESIGN: Analysis of retrospective data obtained from the Virtual Pediatric Systems PICU registry. SETTING: Prospectively collected clinical records from 130 participating PICUs in North America. PATIENTS: Children admitted between January 2009 and December 2014, with a diagnosis of infection at discharge, for whom all required data were available. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Systolic blood pressures, heart rates, and Glasgow Coma Scale scores were used to evaluate the quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Performance was compared with Pediatric Risk of Mortality 3 and Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 risk scores. Data from 42,196 children with complete data were analyzed, with median age 2.7 years (interquartile range, 0.7-8.8 yr; range 0-18 yr) and a 4.27% mortality rate. Mortality was 13.4% for quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 greater than or equal to 2 and 2.5% for quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 less than 2, representing a false-negative rate of 49.5%. Also 311 children (17%) who died had a quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 score of 0. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 72.6% (95% CI, 71.4-73.8%) for quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2, compared with 85.0% (95% CI, 84.0-86.0%) for Pediatric Risk of Mortality 3 and 81.5% (95% CI, 80.5-82.5%) for Pediatric Index of Mortality 2. Performance of quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 was worst in the greater than 12 years age group (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 67.8%; 95% CI, 65-70.5) and best in the less than 1 month age group (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 78.9%; 95% CI, 75.3-82.4). CONCLUSIONS: Quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 performed markedly worse in our cohort, compared with the original study, and the high rate of false negatives limits its clinical utility in our population. Further work is needed to develop a robust quick pediatric sepsis diagnostic tool for both research and clinical care.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many cancer survivors experience fatigue as a nagging symptom lasting years after treatment. To learn of the relevant biological pathways involved in fatigue among cancer survivors, the authors tested for an association between fatigue levels and leukocyte gene expression profiles and determined the specific mediating immune cell types. METHODS: A sample of 89 Hispanic/Latino adults aged 60.5 years, 62% of whom were male, who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer and were 2.9 years since diagnosis provided blood for transcriptome profiling and completed a validated measure of fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form). The authors applied genome-wide transcriptional profiling of leukocyte RNA to identify gene expression activity associated with fatigue, tested for the activity of specific transcription factors involved in previously established markers of inflammation and immunologic activation, and identified the specific cell types mediating these transcriptional alterations. RESULTS: In analyses adjusting for demographic and behavioral health risk factors, results linked fatigue with increased activation of B lymphocytes and CD8-positive T cells, as well as several transcription factors involved in immune activation (nuclear factor \u03baB [NF-\u03baB], signal transducer and activator of transcription [STAT], and cAMP responsive element-binding protein [CREB]). Results also replicated several specific genomic effects previously observed in fatigued cancer survivors, including upregulated expression of \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA) and hemoglobin subunits (HBA and HBB). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors' heightened fatigue levels may be partially explained by activation of specific immune cell subsets, thereby providing a potential molecular biomarker for clinical interventions targeting the remediation of fatigue.

However, while clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been conducted in recent years, the results have not always been favorable. The results from a Phase III trial of the antisense oligonucleotide, that is, tofersen, which targets SOD1 mRNA, showed decreased levels of cerebrospinal fluid SOD1 and plasma neurofilament light chain but no improvements in primary clinical endpoint. Moreover, case reports pertaining to patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis carrying FUS and C9orf72 mutations who received antisense oligonucleotide-based treatments have demonstrated a notable reduction in the targeted protein (thus providing the proof of mechanism) but with no discernible clinical benefits. There are several possible reasons why antisense oligonucleotides knockdown fails to achieve proof of concept, which need to be addressed: on-target adverse effects resulting from the loss of function of target gene and irreversible neuronal death cascade due to toxic protein accumulation, among other factors.

        "title": "Phoenix criteria for sepsis: are these enough to guide a clinician?",
        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. There is a paucity of data on the criteria used to define sepsis and septic shock and predict mortality. Schlapbach et al. published Phoenix criteria to define sepsis in JAMA in 2024. Previously, paediatricians have used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, but these criteria lack sensitivity and specificity. This group recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Though included in the 8-point criteria, important criteria like renal and liver are missing from the main criteria. We remain worried about the way these criteria got excluded from the main criteria. Therefore, in this brief report, whilst commending the authors for this stelar task, we highlight the main pitfalls in these criteria especially the renal, neurologic, and liver criteria. These criteria have been shown to be independently associated with outcomes, and we recommend that in the future iterations of the criteria, renal and liver criteria should be defined according to latest definitions and the task force consider utilizing latest criteria for each organ system involved within the formulated criteria. CONCLUSION: \u00a0In conclusion, Phoenix criteria are a step in the right direction to define life-threatening organ dysfunction in sepsis, but clinicians need to be mindful that diagnosis/treatment of less severe sepsis should not be delayed if these criteria are not met. Therefore, local early detection and management tools for sepsis should be followed. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 There has always been a quest for a definition for pediatric sepsis. There are limitations to the previous pediatric sepsis criteria which were published in 2005 by the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC). IPSCC defines sepsis as a suspected or confirmed infection in the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). These new Phoenix Pediatric Sepsis (PPS) criteria for sepsis and septic shock are intended to identify children with life-threatening organ dysfunction due to infection, and the score was developed based on a very large pediatric dataset. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022 Though the intention of Phoenix criteria is to help identify children with life threatening organ dysfunction, unfortunately the crietria will miss signs of early sepis. In this manuscript, we point out some of the drawbacks of these criteria which need to be borne in mind while applying these criteria.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AIMS: The targeting of solid cancers with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells faces many technological hurdles, including selection of optimal target antigens. Promising pre-clinical and clinical data of CAR T-cell activity have emerged from targeting surface antigens such as GD2 and B7H3 in childhood cancer neuroblastoma. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is expressed in a majority of neuroblastomas at low antigen density but is largely absent from healthy tissues. METHODS: To explore an alternate target antigen for neuroblastoma CAR T-cell therapy, the authors generated and screened a single-chain variable fragment library targeting ALK extracellular domain to make a panel of new anti-ALK CAR T-cell constructs. RESULTS: A lead novel CAR T-cell construct was capable of specific cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma cells expressing low levels of ALK, but with only weak cytokine and proliferative T-cell responses. To explore strategies for amplifying ALK CAR T cells, the authors generated a co-CAR approach in which T cells received signal 1 from a first-generation ALK construct and signal 2 from anti-B7H3 or GD2 chimeric co-stimulatory receptors. The co-CAR approach successfully demonstrated the ability to avoid targeting single-antigen-positive targets as a strategy for mitigating on-target off-tumor toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further proof of concept for ALK as a neuroblastoma CAR T-cell target.",

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal, progressive disease of the motor system. Most approved treatments have a modest effect on disease progression. Tofersen is a recently approved medication that acts by reducing a toxic protein found in a particular form of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This is an overview of the published clinical data for tofersen as well as some background information about tofersen and other treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.What were the results? Treatment with tofersen reduced levels of the target protein and markers of nervous system damage. In longer follow-up, patients treated with tofersen showed less disease progression.What do the results of the study mean? Treatment with tofersen likely slows progression in this form of inherited ALS, though longer duration studies would likely be needed to demonstrate this effect.",

Targeting CD20 has proved to be efficacious in several B cell-mediated immunopathologies, as illustrated by the use of rituximab, the first anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Following rituximab, second- and third-generation anti-CD20 mAbs have been developed and tried in immune-mediated diseases, including obinutuzumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, and veltuzumab. However, their safety and efficacy has not been systematically reviewed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, and veltuzumab for the treatment of immune-mediated disorders compared to placebo, conventional treatment or other biologics. METHODS: The PRISMA checklist guided the reporting of the data. We searched the PubMed database between 4 October 2016 and 22 July 2021 concentrating on immune-mediated disorders. RESULTS: The literature search identified 2220 articles.

However, families value improvements in a range of domains following intervention and the non-motor symptoms, comorbidities and complications of CP can potentially be targeted by cell therapies. We conducted a scoping review to describe all outcomes that have been reported in cell therapy studies for CP to date, and to examine what instruments were used to capture these. Through a systematic search we identified 54 studies comprising 2066 participants that were treated with a range of cell therapy interventions. We categorized the reported 53 unique outcome instruments and additional descriptive measures into 10 categories and 12 sub-categories. Movement and Posture was the most frequently reported outcome category, followed by Safety, however Quality of Life, and various prevalent comorbidities and complications of CP were infrequently reported. Notably, many outcome instruments used do not have evaluative properties and thus are not suitable for measuring change following intervention.

        "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, still represents one of the most common causes of persisting disability with an early disease onset. Growing evidence suggests B cells to play a crucial role in its pathogenesis and progression. Over the last decades, monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against the surface protein CD20 have been intensively studied as a B cell targeting therapy in relapsing MS (RMS) as well as primary progressive MS (PPMS). Pivotal studies on anti-CD20 therapy in RMS showed remarkable clinical and radiological effects, especially on acute inflammation and relapse biology. These results paved the way for further research on the implication of B cells in the pathogenesis of MS. Besides controlling relapse development in RMS, ocrelizumab (OCR) also showed clinical benefits in patients with PPMS and became the first approved drug for this disease course. In this review, we provide an overview of the current anti-CD20 mabs used or tested for the treatment of MS-namely rituximab (RTX), OCR, ofatumumab (OFA), and ublituximab (UB). Besides their effectiveness, we also discuss possible limitations and safety concerns especially in regard to long-term treatment, both for this class of drugs overall as well as for each anti-CD20 mab individually. Additionally, we elucidate to what extent anti-CD20 therapy may alter the function of other immune cells, both directly or indirectly.

Despite having potentially life-threatening toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, the benefits of CAR T-cell therapy far outweigh these risks, particularly as increased experience and improved supportive care measures are mitigating these toxicities. CAR T cells can result in complete remission for significant proportion of patients with relapsed and refractory B-ALL and permit them to proceed to potentially curative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). CAR T cells may also be curative by themselves. Herein lie the greatest challenges and questions for clinical investigators, specifically, how are CAR T cells best employed and how do we overcome mechanisms of resistance to them? The primary clinical question is the timing and even the necessity of allo-HSCT. Relative to resistance, we know that target antigen loss, specifically CD19, is a major contributor to resistance. However, current investigations of alternative targets, such CD22, and CAR T cells expressing dual targeting antigen receptors have demonstrated encouraging initial results and provide a high degree of optimism that the efficacy and the broader application of CAR T-cell therapy will gradually increase in B-ALL. That optimism is not as high and the challenges are increased for the application of CAR T cells in T-cell leukemias and acute myeloid leukemia due to the relative lack of suitable leukemia surface targets that are not also expressed on normal hematopoietic progenitors. Despite these significant challenges, considerable research is being conducted into the development of CAR T cells for these diseases utilizing unique technologies, which may be applicable to other diseases.",

This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "The effect of cytokines on non-traditional immunological targets under conditions of chronic inflammation is an ongoing subject of study. Fatigue is a symptom often associated with autoimmune diseases. Chronic inflammatory response and activated cell-mediated immunity are associated with cardiovascular myopathies which can be driven by muscle weakness and fatigue. Thus, we hypothesize that immune dysfunction-driven changes in myocyte mitochondria may play a critical role in fatigue-related pathogenesis. We show that persistent low-level expression of IFN-\u03b3 in designated IFN-\u03b3 AU-Rich Element deletion mice (ARE mice) under androgen exposure resulted in mitochondrial and metabolic deficiencies in myocytes from male or castrated ARE mice. Most notably, echocardiography unveiled that low ejection fraction in the left ventricle post-stress correlated with mitochondrial deficiencies, explaining how heart function decreases under stress. We report that inefficiencies and structural changes in mitochondria, with changes to expression of mitochondrial genes, are linked to male-biased fatigue and acute cardiomyopathy under stress. Our work highlights how male androgen hormone backgrounds and active autoimmunity reduce mitochondrial function and the ability to cope with stress and how pharmacological blockade of stress signal protects heart function.

        "abstract": "The present study examined genetic, prenatal, and postnatal environmental pathways in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and depressive symptoms from parents to early adolescents (when these symptoms start to increase), while considering timing effects of exposure to parent anxiety and depressive symptoms postnatally. The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

        "title": "Digitally augmented, parent-led CBT versus treatment as usual for child anxiety problems in child mental health services in England and Northern Ireland: a pragmatic, non-inferiority, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety problems are common in children, yet few affected children access evidence-based treatment. Digitally augmented psychological therapies bring potential to increase availability of effective help for children with mental health problems. This study aimed to establish whether therapist-supported, digitally augmented, parent-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could increase the efficiency of treatment without compromising clinical effectiveness and acceptability. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, unblinded, two-arm, multisite, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapist-supported, parent-led CBT using the Online Support and Intervention (OSI) for child anxiety platform compared with treatment as usual for child (aged 5-12 years) anxiety problems in 34 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in England and Northern Ireland. We examined acceptability of OSI plus therapist support via qualitative interviews. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OSI plus therapist support or treatment as usual, minimised by child age, gender, service type, and baseline child anxiety interference. Outcomes were assessed at week 14 and week 26 after randomisation. The primary clinical outcome was parent-reported interference caused by child anxiety at week 26 assessment, using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale-parent report (CAIS-P). The primary measure of health economic effect was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Outcome analyses were conducted blind in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with a standardised non-inferiority margin of 0\u00b733 for clinical analyses. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, 12890382. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2020, and Aug 3, 2022, 706 families (706 children and their parents or carers) were referred to the study information. 444 families were enrolled. Parents reported 255 (58%) child participants' gender to be female, 184 (41%) male, three (<1%) other, and one (<1%) preferred not to report their child's gender. 400 (90%) children were White and the mean age was 9\u00b720 years (SD 1\u00b779). 85% of families for whom clinicians provided information in the treatment as usual group received CBT. OSI plus therapist support was non-inferior for parent-reported anxiety interference on the CAIS-P (SMD 0\u00b701, 95% CI -0\u00b715 to 0\u00b717; p<0\u00b70001) and all secondary outcomes. The mean difference in QALYs across trial arms approximated to zero, and OSI plus therapist support was associated with lower costs than treatment as usual. OSI plus therapist support was likely to be cost effective under certain scenarios, but uncertainty was high. OSI plus therapist support acceptability was good. No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Digitally augmented intervention brought promising savings without compromising outcomes and as such presents a valuable tool for increasing access to psychological therapies and meeting the demand for treatment of child anxiety problems.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of several prognostic scores calculated in the first 24 hours of admission (day 1) in predicting mortality and morbidity among critically ill children with sepsis presenting to the pediatric emergency department (PED) and then admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). METHODS: Single-center, retrospective cohort study in children with a diagnosis of sepsis visiting the PED and then admitted to the PICU from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019. Sepsis organ dysfunction scores-pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) (Schlapbach, Matics, Shime), quickSOFA, quickSOFA-L, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD)-2, quickPELOD-2, and Pediatric Multiple Organ Dysfunction score-were calculated during the first 24 hours of admission (day 1) and their performance compared with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and severe sepsis-International Consensus Conference on Pediatric Sepsis(ICCPS)-derived criteria-using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Primary outcome was PICU mortality. Secondary outcomes were: a composite of death and new disability (ie, change from baseline Pediatric Overall Performance Category score \u22651); prolonged PICU length of stay (>5 d); prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) (>3 d). RESULTS: Among 60 patients with sepsis, 4 (6.7%) died, 7 (11.7%) developed new disability, 26 (43.3%) experienced prolonged length of stay, and 21 (35%) prolonged invasive MV. The prognostic ability in mortality discrimination was significantly higher for organ dysfunction scores, with PELOD-2 showing the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.924; 95% confidence interval, 0.837-1.000), significantly better than SIRS 3 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P = 0.009), SIRS 4 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P < 0.001), and severe sepsis (0.924 vs 0.527, P < 0.001). Among secondary outcomes, PELOD-2 performed significantly better than SIRS criteria and severe sepsis to predict prolonged duration of invasive MV, whereas better than severe sepsis to predict \"poor outcome\" (mortality or new disability). CONCLUSIONS: Day 1 organ dysfunction scores performed better in predicting mortality and morbidity outcomes than ICCPS-derived criteria. The PELOD-2 was the organ dysfunction score with the best performance for all outcomes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is activated by collagens, upregulated in injured and fibrotic kidneys, and contributes to fibrosis by regulating extracellular matrix production, but how DDR1 controls fibrosis is poorly understood. DDR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). RTKs can translocate to the nucleus  METHODS: To determine whether DDR1 translocates to the nucleus and whether this event is mediated by collagen-induced DDR1 activation, we generated renal cells expressing wild-type or mutant forms of DDR1 no longer able to bind collagen. Then, we determined the location of the DDR1 upon collagen stimulation. Using both biochemical assays and immunofluorescence, we analyzed the steps involved in DDR1 nuclear translocation. RESULTS: We show that although DDR1 and its natural ligand, collagen, lack an NLS, DDR1 is present in the nucleus of injured human and mouse kidney proximal tubules. We show that DDR1 nuclear translocation requires collagen-mediated receptor activation and interaction of DDR1 with SEC61B, a component of the Sec61 translocon, and nonmuscle myosin IIA and  CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a novel mechanism whereby activated DDR1 translates to the nucleus to regulate synthesis of profibrotic molecules.",

        "abstract": "Infants with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) continue to have significantly worse outcomes compared with older children with B-ALL, and those with relapsed or refractory (R/R) infant ALL have especially dismal outcomes with conventional treatment. CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in the treatment of R/R childhood B-ALL, although the majority of reports have been in noninfant patients. Barriers to the successful implementation of CAR T-cell therapy in infant B-ALL include challenges related to apheresis, product manufacturing, and disease-specific considerations such as lineage switch. We describe our experience using 2 experimental CD19 CAR T-cell products, SCRI-CAR19 or SCRI-CAR19x22, for 19 patients with R/R infant B-ALL enrolled in 3 clinical trials. CAR T-cell products were successfully manufactured in 18 of 19 (94.7%) patients, with a median age of 22.5\u00a0months at enrollment (range, 14.5-40.1). Of 17 (94.1%) treated patients, 16 achieved a complete remission without detectable minimal residual disease. The 1-year leukemia-free survival was 75%, and 1-year overall survival was 76.5%, with a median follow-up time of 35.8\u00a0months (range, 1.7-83.6). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 14 of 17 (82.4%) patients, with only 1 patient experiencing grade 3 CRS. Neurotoxicity occurred in 2 of 17 (11.8%) patients with all events grade \u22642.

        "abstract": "The effect of cytokines on non-traditional immunological targets under conditions of chronic inflammation is an ongoing subject of study. Fatigue is a symptom often associated with autoimmune diseases. Chronic inflammatory response and activated cell-mediated immunity are associated with cardiovascular myopathies which can be driven by muscle weakness and fatigue. Thus, we hypothesize that immune dysfunction-driven changes in myocyte mitochondria may play a critical role in fatigue-related pathogenesis. We show that persistent low-level expression of IFN-\u03b3 in designated IFN-\u03b3 AU-Rich Element deletion mice (ARE mice) under androgen exposure resulted in mitochondrial and metabolic deficiencies in myocytes from male or castrated ARE mice. Most notably, echocardiography unveiled that low ejection fraction in the left ventricle post-stress correlated with mitochondrial deficiencies, explaining how heart function decreases under stress. We report that inefficiencies and structural changes in mitochondria, with changes to expression of mitochondrial genes, are linked to male-biased fatigue and acute cardiomyopathy under stress. Our work highlights how male androgen hormone backgrounds and active autoimmunity reduce mitochondrial function and the ability to cope with stress and how pharmacological blockade of stress signal protects heart function. These studies provide new insight into the diverse actions of IFN-\u03b3 in fatigue, energy metabolism, and autoimmunity. \u00a9 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

They are mainly expressed during embryonic development and their role during adulthood is very limited. DDR1 has been widely studied in several types of cancers, in atherosclerosis and fibrosis, but also in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review focuses on the role of DDR1 in chronic nephropathies and on the effect of its deletion in the pathological processes involved in renal disease progression. DDR1 was shown to be de novo expressed in several models of experimental CKD. Its genetic or pharmaco-genetic inhibition led to the preservation of renal structure and function, and to decreased inflammatory influx and fibrosis. Furthermore, delayed pharmaco-genetic inhibition of DDR1 led to significant protection in models of renal disease. These results demonstrate the involvement of DDR1 in inflammatory and fibrotic processes occurring during CKD and the beneficial effect of its inhibition. Thus, DDR1 could be an interesting therapeutic target to treat renal pathologies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AIMS: The targeting of solid cancers with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells faces many technological hurdles, including selection of optimal target antigens. Promising pre-clinical and clinical data of CAR T-cell activity have emerged from targeting surface antigens such as GD2 and B7H3 in childhood cancer neuroblastoma. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is expressed in a majority of neuroblastomas at low antigen density but is largely absent from healthy tissues. METHODS: To explore an alternate target antigen for neuroblastoma CAR T-cell therapy, the authors generated and screened a single-chain variable fragment library targeting ALK extracellular domain to make a panel of new anti-ALK CAR T-cell constructs. RESULTS: A lead novel CAR T-cell construct was capable of specific cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma cells expressing low levels of ALK, but with only weak cytokine and proliferative T-cell responses. To explore strategies for amplifying ALK CAR T cells, the authors generated a co-CAR approach in which T cells received signal 1 from a first-generation ALK construct and signal 2 from anti-B7H3 or GD2 chimeric co-stimulatory receptors. The co-CAR approach successfully demonstrated the ability to avoid targeting single-antigen-positive targets as a strategy for mitigating on-target off-tumor toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further proof of concept for ALK as a neuroblastoma CAR T-cell target.",

The purpose of the present study was to identify candidate genes of preterm infants who are susceptible to RSV infection and provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of RSV infection. METHODS: Three datasets (GSE77087, GSE69606 and GSE41374) containing 183 blood samples of RSV infected patients and 33 blood samples of healthy controls from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were downloaded and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out. The function and pathway enrichments were analyzed through Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for DEGs was constructed through Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). The module analysis was performed by Cytoscape software and hub genes were identified. Clinical verification was employed to verify the expression level of top five hub genes among 72 infants including 50 RSV infected patients and 22 non-RSV-infected patients hospitalized in our center. Further, the RSV infected infants with high-expression IFI27 and those with low-expression IFI27 were compared (defined as higher or lower than the median mRNA level). Finally, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) focusing on IFI27 was carried out. RESULTS: Totally, 4028 DEGs were screened out and among which, 131 most significant DEGs were selected. Subsequently, 13 hub genes were identified, and function and pathway enrichments of hub genes mainly were: response to virus, defense response to virus, regulation of viral genome replication and regulation of viral life cycle. Furthermore, IFI27 was confirmed to be the most significantly expressed in clinical verification. Gene sets associated with calcium signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix receptor interaction and so on were significantly enriched when IFI27 was highly expressed. Moreover, high-expression IFI27 was associated with more severe cases (p\u2009=\u20090.041), more requirements of mechanical ventilation (p\u2009=\u20090.034), more frequent hospitalization (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and longer cumulative hospital stay (p\u2009=\u20090.012).

        "abstract": "Cell therapies are an emergent treatment for cerebral palsy (CP) with promising evidence demonstrating efficacy for improving gross motor function. However, families value improvements in a range of domains following intervention and the non-motor symptoms, comorbidities and complications of CP can potentially be targeted by cell therapies. We conducted a scoping review to describe all outcomes that have been reported in cell therapy studies for CP to date, and to examine what instruments were used to capture these. Through a systematic search we identified 54 studies comprising 2066 participants that were treated with a range of cell therapy interventions. We categorized the reported 53 unique outcome instruments and additional descriptive measures into 10 categories and 12 sub-categories. Movement and Posture was the most frequently reported outcome category, followed by Safety, however Quality of Life, and various prevalent comorbidities and complications of CP were infrequently reported. Notably, many outcome instruments used do not have evaluative properties and thus are not suitable for measuring change following intervention. We provide a number of recommendations to ensure that future trials generate high-quality outcome data that is aligned with the priorities of the CP community.",

        "abstract": "The treatment landscape for pediatric cancers over the last 11 years has undergone a dramatic change, especially with relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), due to the introduction of chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy. Because of the success of CAR-T cell therapy in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell ALL, this promising therapy is undergoing trials in multiple other pediatric malignancies. This article will focus on the introduction of CAR-T cell therapy in pediatric B-cell ALL and discuss past and current trials. We will also discuss trials for CAR-T cell therapy in other pediatric malignancies. This information was gathered through a comprehensive literature review along with using first hand institutional experience. Due to the potential severe toxicities related to CAR-T cell therapy, safe practices and monitoring are key. These authors demonstrate that nurses have a profound responsibility in preparing and caring for patients and families, monitoring and managing side effects in these patients, ensuring that study guidelines are followed, and providing continuity for patients, families, and referring providers.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Factor XIa inhibitors are a promising novel class of anticoagulants that attenuate pathological thrombosis with minimal interference with hemostasis. These effects contrast with those of conventional anticoagulants, which may exhibit adverse events of untoward bleeding precluding treatment in some patients. A variety of investigational pharmacological modalities have been developed and studied to target factor XIa. SUMMARY: Asundexian is a small molecule inhibitor of factor XIa that has been evaluated in several clinical studies. It has been studied as an oral, once-daily medication and found to inhibit approximately 90% of factor XIa activity at doses of 20 to 50 mg. Phase 2 trials have demonstrated the potential for improved safety compared to standard of care in certain treatment settings, such as in atrial fibrillation. For other indications, such as noncardioembolic stroke and acute myocardial infarction, asundexian has been used in addition to background antiplatelet therapy. In these instances, asundexian did not show a difference in the incidence of bleeding events compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: Phase 3 trials have recently been launched; however, the OCEANIC-AF trial was prematurely discontinued due to inefficacy of asundexian vs apixaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Another phase 3 trial, OCEANIC-AFINA, is planned to compare asundexian to placebo in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk for stroke who are deemed ineligible for anticoagulation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stroke prevention with direct-acting oral anticoagulant agents in patients with atrial fibrillation confers a risk of bleeding and limits their use. Asundexian, an activated factor XI (XIa) inhibitor, is an oral anticoagulant that may prevent strokes with less bleeding. METHODS: In a phase 3, international, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation in a 1:1 ratio to receive asundexian at a dose of 50 mg once daily or standard-dose apixaban. The primary efficacy objective was to determine whether asundexian is at least noninferior to apixaban for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety objective was to determine whether asundexian is superior to apixaban with respect to major bleeding events. RESULTS: A total of 14,810 randomly assigned patients were included in the intention-to-treat population. The mean (\u00b1SD) age of the patients was 73.9\u00b17.7 years, 35.2% were women, 18.6% had chronic kidney disease, 18.2% had a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, 16.8% had received oral anticoagulants for no more than 6 weeks, and the mean CHA CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke, treatment with asundexian at a dose of 50 mg once daily was associated with a higher incidence of stroke or systemic embolism than treatment with apixaban in the period before the trial was stopped prematurely. There were fewer major bleeding events with asundexian than with apixaban during this time. (Funded by Bayer; OCEANIC-AF ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05643573; EudraCT number, 2022-000758-28.).",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Adhesive capsulitis, also known as \"frozen shoulder,\" is a debilitating shoulder condition increasingly linked to fibroadhesive bursitis, particularly after COVID-19 and related vaccinations. There is no definitive gold standard for its treatment, the primary therapeutic objectives of which are the reduction of pain and the restoration of shoulder range of motion. The aim of our study was to analyze treatment outcomes based on quantitative measures of shoulder function and symptom relief. METHOD: Conducted between January 2022 and April 2023, the research involved 45 patients initially diagnosed with adhesive capsulitis and associated fibroadhesive bursitis. After excluding nine patients for other concomitant pathologies (five for calcific tendinopathy and four for rotator cuff injury), 36 patients were randomized into two groups: one group was treated with glenohumeral hydrodistension, the other with glenohumeral hydrodistension combined with bursal injection. Assessments were conducted at baseline and then 2, 4, and 6\u00a0months after treatment, focusing on changes in pain levels, functional scores, and range of motion in all planes. Each group followed a home-based rehabilitation protocol. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in both treatment groups, with the combined hydrodistension and bursal injection group showing notably superior outcomes. Specifically, the range of motion in flexion improved from an initial median of 80\u00b0 to 155\u00b0 in the combined treatment group, compared to an increase from 75.5\u00b0 to 129\u00b0 in the group treated with hydrodistension alone. This enhancement was statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Regarding pain reduction, the combined treatment group demonstrated a dramatic decrease in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, from a baseline median of 7 to 1 at the 6-month follow-up. In contrast, the hydrodistension-only group showed a reduction from 7 to 3, with these differences also proving statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001). CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided hydrodistension of the glenohumeral joint, if combined with bursal injection and specific exercises, effectively reduces pain, decreases disability, and improves range of motion in patients with second-stage adhesive capsulitis. This study highlights the importance of a combined approach in the management of this complex condition, especially after the histological changes that occurred after COVID-19 and related vaccinations.

METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study included pediatric patients admitted to the PICU for infection. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The six scores included the age-adapted pSOFA score, SIRS score, PELOD2 score, Sepsis-2 score, qSOFA score, and PMODS. RESULTS: Of the 5,356 children admitted to the PICU, 9.1% (488) died, and 25.1% (1,342) had basic disease with a mortality rate of 12.7% (171); 65.3% (3,499) of the patients were younger than 2 years, and 59.4% (3,183) were male. The discrimination abilities of the pSOFA and PELOD2 scores were superior to those of the other models. The calibration curves of the pSOFA and PELOD2 scores were consistent between the predictions and observations. Elevated lactate levels were a risk factor for mortality. CONCLUSION: The pSOFA and PELOD2 scores had superior predictive performance for mortality. Given the relative unavailability of items and clinical operability, the pSOFA score should be recommended as an optimal tool for acute organ dysfunction in pediatric sepsis patients. Elevated lactate levels are related to a greater risk of death from infection in children in the PICU.",

We compared the effectiveness and safety of pharmacopuncture and physiotherapy for AC. METHODS: This pragmatic, randomized, controlled, parallel-group pilot study enrolled patients with limitations of shoulder movement and a numeric rating scale (NRS) score for shoulder pain \u22655 randomized (1:1) to the pharmacopuncture therapy (PPT) and physiotherapy (PT) groups. Treatment sessions were administered twice weekly for 6 weeks, and the participants were followed up for 13 weeks after randomization. The primary outcome was the NRS score for shoulder pain, and the secondary outcomes were the visual analog scale (VAS), Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), range of motion (ROM), patient global impression of change (PGIC), EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), and Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12) scores. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was set as the primary analysis. RESULTS: Among 50 participants, for the primary endpoint (week 7) the PPT group showed a significantly superior improvement in NRS, VAS, SPADI, ROM for flexion, ROM for abduction, and EQ-5D-5L scores. The ROM for extension, ROM for adduction, physical component summary, and patient global impression of change were significantly better in the PPT than in the PT group, and these effects were sustained until week 13. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, PPT showed better effects than PT, confirming the feasibility of a follow-up main study.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The involvement of B-cells in multiple sclerosis has only recently emerged. Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the B-cell antigen CD20 with enhanced B-cell targeting. AREAS COVERED: This evaluation is of the identical ULTIMATE (UbLiTuximab In Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Effects) I and II trials comparing ublituximab (TG-1101) and teriflunomide in relapsing multiple sclerosis. The primary efficacy end point was the annualized relapse rate and was lower in the ublituximab than the teriflunomide group. EXPERT OPINION: The continuation rates to oral teriflunomide in ULTIMATE were higher than in other trials, possibly because of the supervised double-dummy protocol used with intravenous ublituximab. This may have contributed to the higher efficacy with teriflunomide in this trial than previously reported. Nevertheless, ublituximab was more effective than teriflunomide at reducing the annualized relapse rates and MRI endpoints, but not for no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the ULTIMATE trials did show that ublituximab was superior to teriflunomide in NEDA. Long-term studies of the adverse effects of ublituximab are required. Despite the positive results from ULTIMATE for ublituximab, it is still under the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and conclusions should await their findings.",

        "abstract": "According to the \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), brain A\u03b2 accumulation is the primary cascade event leading to cognitive deficit and dementia. Numerous anti-A\u03b2 drugs either inhibiting production or aggregation of A\u03b2 or stimulating its clearance have failed to show clinical benefit in large scale AD trials, with \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase inhibitors consistently worsening cognitive and clinical decline. In June 2021, the FDA approved aducanumab, an anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody for early AD based on its ability to reduce brain amyloid plaques, while two other amyloid-clearing antibodies (lecanemab and donanemab) have recently produced encouraging cognitive and clinical results. We reviewed AD trials using PubMed, meeting abstracts and ClinicalTrials.gov and evaluated the effects of such drugs on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2 levels, correlating them with cognitive effects. We found that \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase inhibitors produce detrimental cognitive effects by significantly reducing CSF A\u03b2 levels. We speculate that monoclonal antibodies targeting A\u03b2 protofibrils, fibrils or plaques may improve cognitive performance in early AD by increasing soluble A\u03b2 levels through A\u03b2 aggregate disassembly and/or stabilization of existing A\u03b2 monomers.These findings suggest that the real culprit in AD may be decreased levels of soluble monomeric A\u03b2 due to sequestration into brain A\u03b2 aggregates and plaques.",

Traditional treatments include a combination of conservative and surgical modalities, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, physical therapy, and open capsular release. We describe a modification to hydrodilatation of the frozen shoulder. Our technique describes the gradual dilation of the glenohumeral (GH) capsule with the goal of seeing a gentle release of the frozen shoulder. Furthermore, we outline our protocol for patient preparation with preprocedural diazepam 5\u2009mg and Hydrocodone 5\u2009mg-Acetaminophen 325\u2009mg, one tablet each. During the procedure, we inject a solution of 10\u2009mL lidocaine mixed with 2\u2009mL of 40\u2009mg/mL triamcinolone acetonide injection (80\u2009mg total) through an anterior approach at the level of the rotator interval for pain control. Following this injection, we proceed to fenestrate the superior glenohumeral ligament (SGHL) in the process. We conclude the procedure with hydrodilatation of the GH joint (GHJ) through the posterior approach with approximately 50\u2009mL of 0.9% normal saline, or until an expansion and release of the GH joint is visualized under ultrasound visualization.

Conventional MPS, caused by inborn deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes involved in GAG degradation, display various multisystemic symptoms-including progressive neurological complications, ophthalmological disorders, hearing loss, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary issues, cardiorespiratory problems, bone and joint abnormalities, dwarfism, and coarse facial features. Mucopolysaccharidosis-Plus Syndrome (MPSPS), an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the endo-lysosomal tethering protein VPS33A, shows additional renal and hematopoietic abnormalities (\"Plus symptoms\") uncommon in conventional MPS. Here, we analyze data from biochemical, histological, and physical examinations-particularly of blood counts and kidney function-to further characterize the clinical phenotype of MPSPS. A series of blood tests indicate hematopoietic symptoms including progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia, which correlate with histological observations of hypoplastic bone marrow. High urinary excretion of protein (caused by impairments in renal filtration), hypoalbuminemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, cholesterol, and uric acid indicate renal dysfunction. Histological analyses of MPSPS kidneys similarly suggest the extensive destruction of glomerular structures by foamy podocytes.

Targeting CD20 has proved to be efficacious in several B cell-mediated immunopathologies, as illustrated by the use of rituximab, the first anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Following rituximab, second- and third-generation anti-CD20 mAbs have been developed and tried in immune-mediated diseases, including obinutuzumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, and veltuzumab. However, their safety and efficacy has not been systematically reviewed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, and veltuzumab for the treatment of immune-mediated disorders compared to placebo, conventional treatment or other biologics. METHODS: The PRISMA checklist guided the reporting of the data. We searched the PubMed database between 4 October 2016 and 22 July 2021 concentrating on immune-mediated disorders. RESULTS: The literature search identified 2220 articles.

Fatigue occurs in 70% of patients, characterizing primary SS (pSS) and significantly impacting the patient's quality of life. There are some generic and specific instruments used to measure fatigue in SS. The mechanisms involved with fatigue in SS are still poorly understood, but it appears fatigue signaling pathways are more associated with cell protection and defense than with pro-inflammatory pathways. There are no established pharmacological treatment options for fatigue in pSS. So far, exercise and neuromodulation techniques have shown positive effects on fatigue in pSS.

Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutations are found in about 2% of all patients. Tofersen is a novel oligonucleotide antisense drug specifically developed to treat SOD1-ALS patients. AREAS COVERED: Our review covers and discusses tofersen pharmacological properties and its phase I/II and III clinical trials results. Other available drugs and their limitations are also addressed. EXPERT OPINION: VALOR study failed to meet the primary endpoint (change in the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale score from baseline to week 28, tofersen arm vs. placebo), but a significant reduction in plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels was observed in tofersen arm (60% vs. 20%). PrefALS study has proposed plasma NfL has a potential biomarker for presymptomatic treatment, since it increases 6-12\u2009months before phenoconversion. There is probably a delay between plasma NfL reduction and the clinical benefit. ATLAS study will allow more insights regarding tofersen clinical efficacy in disease progression rate, survival, and even disease onset delay in presymptomatic SOD1 carriers.",

CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in the treatment of R/R childhood B-ALL, although the majority of reports have been in noninfant patients. Barriers to the successful implementation of CAR T-cell therapy in infant B-ALL include challenges related to apheresis, product manufacturing, and disease-specific considerations such as lineage switch. We describe our experience using 2 experimental CD19 CAR T-cell products, SCRI-CAR19 or SCRI-CAR19x22, for 19 patients with R/R infant B-ALL enrolled in 3 clinical trials. CAR T-cell products were successfully manufactured in 18 of 19 (94.7%) patients, with a median age of 22.5\u00a0months at enrollment (range, 14.5-40.1).

Through a systematic search we identified 54 studies comprising 2066 participants that were treated with a range of cell therapy interventions. We categorized the reported 53 unique outcome instruments and additional descriptive measures into 10 categories and 12 sub-categories. Movement and Posture was the most frequently reported outcome category, followed by Safety, however Quality of Life, and various prevalent comorbidities and complications of CP were infrequently reported.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effect of neonatal treatment with kaempferol on neuromotor development, proliferation of neural precursor cells, the microglia profile, and antioxidant enzyme gene expression in the hippocampus. METHODS: A rat model of cerebral palsy was established using perinatal anoxia and sensorimotor restriction of hindlimbs during infancy. Kaempferol (1\u2005mg/ kg) was intraperitoneally administered during the neonatal period. RESULTS: Neonatal treatment with kaempferol reduces the impact of the cerebral palsy model on reflex ontogeny and on the maturation of physical features. Impairment of locomotor activity development and motor coordination was found to be attenuated by kaempferol treatment during the neonatal period in rats exposed to cerebral palsy. Neonatal treatment of kaempferol in cerebral palsy rats prevents a substantial reduction in the number of neural precursor cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, an activated microglia profile, and increased proliferation of microglia in the sub-granular zone and in the granular cell layer. Neonatal treatment with kaempferol increases gene expression of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the hippocampus of rats submitted to the cerebral palsy model. DISCUSSION: Kaempferol attenuates the impact of cerebral palsy on neuromotor behavior development, preventing altered hippocampal microglia activation and mitigating impaired cell proliferation in a neurogenic niche in these rats. Neonatal treatment with kaempferol also increases antioxidant defense gene expression in the hippocampus of rats submitted to the cerebral palsy model.",

RESULTS: IncobotulinumtoxinA (\u2264500 Units for \u226498 weeks) was safe, well-tolerated, and effective across all endpoints for multipattern treatment of LL and combined LL/UL spasticity in ambulant/nonambulant children/adolescents with CP. Treatment effects increased with each injection cycle. No new/unexpected safety concerns were identified. CONCLUSION: IncobotulinumtoxinA showed a good safety and tolerability profile, with efficacy over multiple clinical presentations. As an adjunct treatment, it offers an effective, individualized treatment option for pediatric CP-related spasticity.",

METHODS: The randomized controlled trials (RCT) of biofeedback therapy in the treatment of cerebral palsy were searched in PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China VIP Database, Wanfang Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM). The starting time and ending time of this study are from the time of building the database of the number of pieces to October 31, 2018. The data included in this study were extracted by two independent researchers and evaluated the bias risk of all the literature included in the study according to the Cochrane manual 5.1.0 criteria. RevMan5.4 statistical software was used to analyze the collected data by meta. RESULTS: This systematic review included 9 RCT studies with a total of 1410 patients. The results of meta-analysis showed that there were significant differences in the improvement of lower limb muscle tension, comprehensive spasm scale score, EMG score, and passive range of motion of ankle joint between biofeedback therapy and routine rehabilitation therapy. CONCLUSION: Biofeedback therapy can improve lower limb muscle tension, spasticity, EMG integral value, and passive range of motion of ankle joint in children with cerebral palsy and provide better conditions for improving the motor ability of lower extremities in children with cerebral palsy. However, more studies and follow-up with higher methodological quality and longer intervention time are needed to further verify.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral palsy, which occurs in two to three out of 1,000 live births, has multiple etiologies resulting in brain injury that affects movement, posture, and balance. The movement disorders associated with cerebral palsy are categorized as spasticity, dyskinesia, ataxia, or mixed/other. Spasticity is the most common movement disorder, occurring in 80% of children with cerebral palsy. Movement disorders of cerebral palsy can result in secondary problems, including hip pain or dislocation, balance problems, hand dysfunction, and equinus deformity. Diagnosis of cerebral palsy is primarily clinical, but magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful to confirm brain injury if there is no clear cause for the patient's symptoms. Once cerebral palsy has been diagnosed, an instrument such as the Gross Motor Function Classification System can be used to evaluate severity and treatment response. Treatments for the movement disorders associated with cerebral palsy include intramuscular onabotulinumtoxinA, systemic and intrathecal muscle relaxants, selective dorsal rhizotomy, and physical and occupational therapies. Patients with cerebral palsy often also experience problems unrelated to movement that need to be managed into adulthood, including cognitive dysfunction, seizures, pressure ulcers, osteoporosis, behavioral or emotional problems, and speech and hearing impairment.",

Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To study the metabolic mechanism of neonatal sepsis at different stages by analyzing the metabolic pathways involving the serum metabolites with significant differences in neonates with sepsis at different time points after admission. METHODS: A total of 20 neonates with sepsis who were hospitalized in the Department of Neonatology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, from January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2020 were enrolled as the sepsis group. Venous blood samples were collected on days 1, 4, and 7 after admission. Ten healthy neonates who underwent physical examination during the same period were enrolled as the control group. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for the metabonomic analysis of serum samples to investigate the change in metabolomics in neonates with sepsis at different time points. RESULTS: On day 1 after admission, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between the sepsis and control groups were mainly involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid skeleton. For the sepsis group, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 4 after admission were mainly involved in pyruvate metabolism, and those between days 4 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in the metabolism of cysteine and methionine. The differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in ascorbic acid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic mechanism of serum metabolites varies at different stages in neonates with sepsis and is mainly associated with terpenoid skeleton biosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism, cysteine/methionine metabolism, and ascorbic acid metabolism.

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis remains one of the leading causes of mortality in newborns. Several brainstem-regulated physiological processes undergo disruption during neonatal sepsis. Mechanistic knowledge gaps exist at the interplay between metabolism and immune activation to brainstem neural circuits and pertinent physiological functions in neonates. To delineate this association, we induced systemic inflammation either by TLR4 (LPS) or TLR1/2 (PAM3CSK4) ligand administration in postnatal day 5 mice (PD5). Our findings show that LPS and PAM3CSK4 evoke substantial changes in respiration and metabolism. Physiological trade-offs led to hypometabolic-hypothermic responses due to LPS, but not PAM3CSK4, whereas to both TLR ligands blunted respiratory chemoreflexes. Neuroinflammatory pathways modulation in brainstem showed more robust effects in LPS than PAM3CSK4. Brainstem neurons, microglia, and astrocyte gene expression analyses showed unique responses to TLR ligands. PAM3CSK4 did not significantly modulate gene expression changes in GLAST-1 positive brainstem astrocytes. PD5 pups receiving PAM3CSK4 failed to maintain a prolonged metabolic state repression, which correlated to enhanced gasping latency and impaired autoresuscitation during anoxic chemoreflex challenges. In contrast, LPS administered pups showed no significant changes in anoxic chemoreflex. Electrophysiological studies from brainstem slices prepared from pups exposed to either TLR4 or PAM3CSK4 showed compromised transmission between preB\u00f6tzinger complex and Hypoglossal as an exclusive response to the TLR1/2 ligand. Spatial gene expression analysis demonstrated a region-specific modulation of PAM3CSK4 within the raphe nucleus relative to other anatomical sites evaluated. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes due to inflammation might be a crucial tolerance mechanism for neonatal sepsis preserving neural control of breathing.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022\u00a0We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method.

All preterm newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were eligible for this proof-of-concept, prospective case-control study. Infants were enrolled as \"cases\" if they developed EOS, and as \"controls\"if they did not. Plasma samples collected at birth and urine samples collected within 24 h of birth underwent untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis using mass spectrometry coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Of 123 eligible newborns, 15 developed EOS. These 15 newborns matched controls for gestational age and weight. Metabolomic analysis revealed evident clustering of the cases versus controls, with the glutathione and tryptophan metabolic pathways markedly disrupted in the former. In conclusion, neonates with EOS had a metabolic profile at birth that clearly distinguished them from those without sepsis, and metabolites of glutathione and tryptophan pathways are promising as new biomarkers of neonatal sepsis.",

The screened abstracts were independently considered for eligibility by two researchers. PROSPERO ID: CRD42020164454. RESULTS: The search identified in total 762 articles. Fifteen articles were assessed for eligibility. Four studies were included, with totally 78 neonates. The studies used different diagnostic criteria and had between 1 and 16 sepsis cases. All studies with bacterial sepsis found alterations in the glucose and lactate metabolism, reflecting possible redistribution of glucose consumption from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to the lactate and pentose phosphate pathway. We also found signs of increased oxidative stress and fatty acid oxidation in sepsis cases. CONCLUSION: We found signs of metabolomic signatures in neonatal sepsis. This may lead to better understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and detection of new candidate biomarkers. Results should be validated in large-scale multicentre studies.",

This new disease entity was described as mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome (MPSPS). The name of the disease indicates that in addition to the typical symptoms of conventional MPS, patients develop other features such as congenital heart defects and kidney and hematopoietic system disorders. The symptoms are highly advanced, and patients usually do not survive past the second year of life. MPSPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a homozygous-specific mutation in the gene encoding the VPS33A protein. To date, it has been described in 41 patients. Patients with MPSPS exhibited excessive excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the urine and exceptionally high levels of heparan sulfate in the plasma, but the accumulation of substrates is not caused by a decrease in the activity of any lysosomal enzymes. Here, we discuss the pathomechanisms and symptoms of MPSPS, comparing them to those of MPS. Moreover, we asked the question whether MPSPS should be classified as a type of MPS or a separate disease, as contrary to 'classical' MPS types, despite GAG accumulation, no defects in lysosomal enzymes responsible for degradation of these compounds could be detected in MPSPS. The molecular mechanism of the appearance of GAG accumulation in MPSPS is suggested on the basis of results available in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Current research on personality disorders strives to identify key behavioural and cognitive facets of patient functioning, to unravel the underlying root causes and maintenance mechanisms. This process often involves the application of social paradigms - however, these often only include momentary affective depictions rather than unfolding interactions. This constitutes a limitation in our capacity to probe core symptoms, and leaves potential findings uncovered which could help those who are in close relationships with affected individuals. Here, we deployed a novel task in which subjects interact with four unknown virtual partners in a turn-taking paradigm akin to a dance, and report on their experience with each. The virtual partners embody four combinations of low/high expressivity of positive/negative mood. Higher scores on our symptomatic measures of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were all linked to a general negative appraisal of all the interpersonal experiences. Moreover, the negative appraisal of the partner who displayed a high negative/low positive mood was tied with attachment anxiety and BPD symptoms. The extent to which subjects felt responsible for causing partners' distress was most strongly linked to attachment anxiety. Finally, we provide a fully-fledged exploration of move-by-move action latencies and click distances from partners. This analysis underscored slower movement initiation from anxiously attached individuals throughout all virtual interactions. In summary, we describe a novel paradigm for second-person neuroscience, which allowed both the replication of established results and the capture of new behavioural signatures associated with attachment anxiety, and discuss its limitations.",

        "abstract": "Since Stern first started his work in 1938, the field has recognized several empirically supported models of the etiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Two such models are the Tripartite Model of the Development of BPD and the Biosocial Development Model of BPD. The Tripartite Model of the Development of BPD suggests that it is a combination of a hyperbolic temperament, traumatic childhood experiences, and an event or series of events that trigger the onset of BPD. Whereas the Biosocial Development Model of BPD elaborates on the work of Linehan's Biosocial Theory. This model suggests a combination of an emotionally vulnerable temperament and an invalidating environment cause BPD. Over 70 years of research support these models. This article covers a detailed description of each of these models, the decades of research supporting these models, similarities, differences, treatment implications, the latest research, and future directions.",

The United States (US) currently has the highest annual prevalence rate of cannabis consumption in the world, 17.9% in individuals aged 12 or older, and it is on the rise. With increasing cannabis use comes the potential for an increase in abuse, and according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), approximately 5.1% of Americans had Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) in 2020. Research has shown that genetics and epigenetics play a significant role in cannabis use and CUD. In fact, approximately 50-70% of liability to CUD and 40-48% of cannabis use initiation have been found to be the result of genetic factors. Cannabis usage and CUD have also been linked to an increased risk of psychiatric disorders and Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) subsets like schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. Comprehension of the genetic and epigenetic aspects of cannabinoids is necessary for future research, treatment plans, and the production of pure cannabinoid compounds, which will be essential for FDA approval.

Risk factors for obesity and cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, poor regulation of stress, low HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance are among the physical health repercussions we see. The psychological health effects comprise suicidal tendencies and symptoms of depression which are associated with digital device dependency, screen-time-induced poor sleep quality, and content-influenced negativity. Oftentimes it can cause the induction of a state of hyper-arousal, increase stress hormones, desynchronize the body clock or the circadian cycle, alter brain chemistry and create a drag on mental energy and development.

Conventional MPS, caused by inborn deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes involved in GAG degradation, display various multisystemic symptoms-including progressive neurological complications, ophthalmological disorders, hearing loss, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary issues, cardiorespiratory problems, bone and joint abnormalities, dwarfism, and coarse facial features. Mucopolysaccharidosis-Plus Syndrome (MPSPS), an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the endo-lysosomal tethering protein VPS33A, shows additional renal and hematopoietic abnormalities (\"Plus symptoms\") uncommon in conventional MPS. Here, we analyze data from biochemical, histological, and physical examinations-particularly of blood counts and kidney function-to further characterize the clinical phenotype of MPSPS. A series of blood tests indicate hematopoietic symptoms including progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia, which correlate with histological observations of hypoplastic bone marrow. High urinary excretion of protein (caused by impairments in renal filtration), hypoalbuminemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, cholesterol, and uric acid indicate renal dysfunction. Histological analyses of MPSPS kidneys similarly suggest the extensive destruction of glomerular structures by foamy podocytes.

        "abstract": "Fatigue is defined as a symptom leading to the inability to continue functioning at the expected activity level. It is a highly prevalent symptom, challenging to frame into monodimensional pathophysiological mechanisms. As a result, fatigue is often underestimated in the clinical setting and is wrongly considered an unavoidable consequence of ageing. Several potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue have been proposed, including sleep patterns, autonomic nervous system abnormalities and biological complexity. Inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the most promising mechanisms through which malnutrition may cause fatigue. Not surprisingly, fatigue is highly prevalent in inflammatory conditions (e.g. COVID-19 infection). The nutritional status may also represent a critical factor in the development and presentation of fatigue, which may mimic the exhaustion of the individual's metabolic reserves. For example, the insufficient dietary intake of energy and proteins may determine the catabolism of body fat and muscles, disrupt the homeostatic balance and cause the onset of fatigue. It is necessary to conduct research on fatigue. By characterising its pathophysiological mechanisms, it will be possible to (1) support the design and development of targeted interventions, (2) improve the quality of life of many persons by acting on the symptom and (3) reduce the direct and indirect costs of a burdening condition typical of advancing age. In the present review, we provide an overview of the role that nutrition may play as a determinant of fatigue in older people, also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, the adverse effects of prenatal REEs exposure on children's neurodevelopment are not yet fully recognized. Therefore, we investigated the individual and joint effects of prenatal exposure to 13 REEs on children's neurocognitive development based on 809 mother-child pairs from a large birth cohort in Wuhan, China. Maternal urinary concentrations of 13 REEs were repeatedly measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Children's neurodevelopment [e.g., mental and psychomotor development index (MDI/PDI)] at 24-months was assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development of Chinese Revision. GEE and BKMR models were applied to estimate the individual and joint effects of prenatal REE exposure on child neurodevelopment level. After controlling for typical confounders, we observed that exposure to 9 REEs during the first trimester were significantly associated with decreased MDI scores [\u03b2s and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) ranging from -2.24 (-3.86\u00a0\u223c\u00a0-0.63) to -1.44 (-2.26\u223c -0.26)], and 7 REEs during third trimester were significantly associated decreased PDI scores [\u03b2 and 95% CIs ranging from -1.95 (-3.19\u00a0\u223c\u00a0-0.71) to -1.25 (-2.34\u00a0\u223c\u00a0-0.16)]. Higher quantiles of REE mixture in first and third trimester were associated with decreased MDI and PDI score. Thulium, erbium in the first trimester and cerium, lanthanum in the third trimester accounted most importance to joint effects on MDI and PDI, respectively. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to higher concentrations of REEs during the first and third trimester were negative associated with children's neurodevelopment.",

This implementation study (ci-chimps) evaluates three clinical implementation projects with three different implementation interventions for the optimal implementation of the tailored family-oriented preventive and therapeutic interventions in the CHIMPS-NET (children of mentally ill parents-research network) with an implementation model for children of mentally ill parents. METHODS: A two-group randomized controlled multicenter trial will examine changes in family-oriented practice and aspects of implementation at baseline as well as at 12- and 24-months follow-up. The CHIMPS-Network consists of 20 clinical centers. The centers in the intervention group receive the support of all of the three implementation interventions: (1) optimal pathways to care, (2) education and a training program for professionals, and (3) systematic screening for children. The centers in the control group do not receive this specific implementation support. DISCUSSION: While we know that children of mentally ill parents are an important target group to be addressed by preventive and therapeutic interventions, there is often a lack of structured implementation of family-oriented interventions in clinical practice in Germany. Using a randomized controlled multicenter trial design with a large and wide-ranging sample (clinics for adult psychiatry and clinics for child and adolescent psychiatry, university clinics and clinics at the real health care) will provide a robust understanding of implementing family-oriented changes in German clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The CHIMPS-NET-study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register on 2019-12-19 (DRKS00020380) and with Clinical Trials on 2020-4-30 (NCT04369625), the ci-chimps-study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00026217) on 2021-08-27, the Clinical Trials registration is in review process.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aging is a complex and gradual biological process that represents the major risk factor with respect to the development of chronic degenerative diseases, often associated with disability. Diet and nu-trition, coupled with proper physical activity have a significant impact on the health status of the elderly with a decreased risk of disease being indicative of successful aging. Musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia are the most frequently reported disorders among the elderly community. METHODS: This study presents a systematic review of the literature on the potential benefits of several nutra-ceuticals in promoting healthy aging and in reducing the risk of chronic diseases in elderly individuals. RESULTS: Dietary components including vitamins (vitamin C, B vitamin and vitamin K) flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, anthocyanins, and isoflavones), minerals (e.g., magnesium, zinc and potassium) and other nutrients such phytoestrogens, amino acids, and omega-3 fatty acids help in slowing the aging process, which ultimately results in increased lifespan and longevity. CONCLUSIONS: This paper highlights the key nutrients and phytochemicals of nutraceutical importance for the healthy aging of the elderly population. Although the scientific literature provides evidences of therapeutic effectiveness of nutraceuticals, more in-depth clinical investigations are needed.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Learning disabilities or learning disorders are umbrella terms used for wide variety of learning problems like Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dysgraphia, and Dyspraxia. These disabilities are due to the neurological disorders which affects brain functions. Early diagnosis of these disabilities in kids from age 3 to 6 will help to start early medical treatments and get them back to the normal condition. MATERIAL AND METHOD: we developed a software-based Learning Disability Evaluation Kit called YALU with computer Game Modules for kids targeting their learning disabilities. These Computer game-based modules of the YALU consist of different tasks for the different age levels to identify the symptoms of the disabilities mentioned above. The children's interaction results to each task of the game modules with the answers of the questioner about the children given by the parents will be evaluated with the threshold values given by a panel of consultant psychologist and paediatrician of the normal kids to identify the learning disabilities in kids aged 3-6\u2009years. The result will be given to the respective parties and uploaded to the Website under the child's name. RESULT: YALU has been tested using 50 students in age 3-5 in three preschools. The teachers have identified Fourteen students with some learning disability symptoms. Using YALU, twelve out of fourteen students had been clearly identified. Hence, the YALU Evaluation Kit to have an accuracy 85% in diagnosing the right disability. However, the accuracy could be increased with the accurate assessments of the parents about their kids.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONLearning disabilities are neurological disorders that affect the brain's ability to receive, process, store, respond to and communicate information; and there are four types (Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Dysgraphia and Dyscalculia)In this paper, we present the extracted computational techniques targeting the Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Dysgraphia and Dyscalculia and developed a software application (YALU Learning Disability Evaluation Kit) which consists of computer game modules for the kids for evaluation their learning disabilities.The developed game modules can screen the learning disabilities and these gamification modules (YALU) consists of tasks which are based on symptoms of the said disabilities. The outcomes of each module is evaluated these learning disabilities in kids age from 3 years to 6 years by analysing children's interactions to the each tasks, the child condition and then compare the result with the threshold values of the normal kids given by consultant psychologist and paediatrician.",

        "title": "Fatigue in older persons: the role of nutrition.",
        "abstract": "Fatigue is defined as a symptom leading to the inability to continue functioning at the expected activity level. It is a highly prevalent symptom, challenging to frame into monodimensional pathophysiological mechanisms. As a result, fatigue is often underestimated in the clinical setting and is wrongly considered an unavoidable consequence of ageing. Several potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue have been proposed, including sleep patterns, autonomic nervous system abnormalities and biological complexity. Inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the most promising mechanisms through which malnutrition may cause fatigue. Not surprisingly, fatigue is highly prevalent in inflammatory conditions (e.g. COVID-19 infection). The nutritional status may also represent a critical factor in the development and presentation of fatigue, which may mimic the exhaustion of the individual's metabolic reserves. For example, the insufficient dietary intake of energy and proteins may determine the catabolism of body fat and muscles, disrupt the homeostatic balance and cause the onset of fatigue. It is necessary to conduct research on fatigue. By characterising its pathophysiological mechanisms, it will be possible to (1) support the design and development of targeted interventions, (2) improve the quality of life of many persons by acting on the symptom and (3) reduce the direct and indirect costs of a burdening condition typical of advancing age. In the present review, we provide an overview of the role that nutrition may play as a determinant of fatigue in older people, also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiological characteristics of pediatric sepsis in Southwest China PICUs. DESIGN: A prospective, multicenter, and observational study. SETTING: Twelve PICUs in Southwest China. PATIENTS: The patients admitted to the PICU from April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023. The age ranged from 28 days to 18 years. All patients met the criteria of severe sepsis or septic shock. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 31 PICUs invited to participate, 12 PICUs (capacity of 292 beds) enrolled patients in the study. During the study period, 11,238 children were admitted to the participating PICUs, 367 (3.3%) of whom met the diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock. The most prevalent sites of infection were the respiratory system (55%) and the digestive system (15%). The primary treatments administered to these patients included antibiotics (100%), albumin (61.3%), invasive mechanical ventilation (58.7%), glucocorticoids (55.6%), blood products (51%), gammaglobulin (51%), and vasoactive medications (46.6%). Sepsis-related mortality in the PICU was 11.2% (41/367). Nearly half of the sepsis deaths occurred within the first 3 days of PICU admission (22/41, 53.7%). The mortality rate of septic shock (32/167, 19.2%) was significantly higher than that of severe sepsis (9/200, 4.5%; p < 0.001). The outcomes of a multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that a higher pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and the use of invasive mechanical ventilation and vasoactive medications were independently associated with PICU mortality in children with sepsis.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms \"sepsis,\" \"septicemia,\" or \"septic shock\" in the title or abstract. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001).

The principal elements of the most recent guidelines are summarized in this practice point. These elements include recognition of changes in clinical condition and vital signs, such as fever, tachycardia, and changes in peripheral perfusion, which should raise concern for sepsis; initial stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation; timely administration of empiric antimicrobial therapy; use of fluid boluses and vasoactive medications; and specific considerations in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as the use of corticosteroids for possible adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic-adrenal suppression. Two changes from previous guidelines are the concern for fluid overload, implying the need for clinical re-assessment after administration of each fluid bolus, and the removal of dopamine as the initial vasoactive agent for use in hypotensive paediatric patients, with recommendations for the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine as dictated by the clinical context. This practice point focuses primarily on sepsis management in older infants, children, and youth.",

        "title": "Epidemiology and Immune Pathogenesis of Viral Sepsis.",
        "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can be caused by a broad range of pathogens; however, bacterial infections represent the majority of sepsis cases. Up to 42% of sepsis presentations are culture negative, suggesting a non-bacterial cause. Despite this, diagnosis of viral sepsis remains very rare. Almost any virus can cause sepsis in vulnerable patients (e.g., neonates, infants, and other immunosuppressed groups). The prevalence of viral sepsis is not known, nor is there enough information to make an accurate estimate. The initial standard of care for all cases of sepsis, even those that are subsequently proven to be culture negative, is the immediate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the absence of definite diagnostic criteria for viral sepsis, or at least to exclude bacterial sepsis, this inevitably leads to unnecessary antimicrobial use, with associated consequences for antimicrobial resistance, effects on the host microbiome and excess healthcare costs. It is important to understand non-bacterial causes of sepsis so that inappropriate treatment can be minimised, and appropriate treatments can be developed to improve outcomes. In this review, we summarise what is known about viral sepsis, its most common causes, and how the immune responses to severe viral infections can contribute to sepsis. We also discuss strategies to improve our understanding of viral sepsis, and ways we can integrate this new information into effective treatment.",

        "title": "Two subtle problems with overrepresentation analysis.",
        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Overrepresentation analysis (ORA) is used widely to assess the enrichment of functional categories in a gene list compared to a background list. ORA is therefore a critical method in the interpretation of 'omics data, relating gene lists to biological functions and themes. Although ORA is hugely popular, we and others have noticed two potentially undesired behaviours of some ORA tools. The first one we call the 'background problem', because it involves the software eliminating large numbers of genes from the background list if they are not annotated as belonging to any category. The second one we call the 'false discovery rate problem', because some tools underestimate the true number of parallel tests conducted. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate the impact of these issues on several real RNA-seq datasets and use simulated RNA-seq data to quantify the impact of these problems. We show that the severity of these problems depends on the gene set library, the number of genes in the list, and the degree of noise in the dataset. These problems can be mitigated by changing packages/websites for ORA or by changing to another approach such as functional class scoring.

        "title": "Gene Expression Profiles in Children With Suspected Sepsis.",
        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Sepsis recognition is a clinical challenge in children. We aim to determine whether peripheral blood gene expression profiles are associated with pathogen type and sepsis severity in children with suspected sepsis. METHODS: This was a prospective pilot observational study in a tertiary pediatric emergency department with a convenience sample of children enrolled. Participants were older than 56 days and younger than 18 years, had suspected sepsis, and had not received broad-spectrum antibiotics in the previous 4 hours. Primary outcome was source pathogen, defined as confirmed bacterial source from sterile body fluid or confirmed viral source. Secondary outcome was sepsis severity, defined as maximum therapy required for shock reversal in the first 3 hospital days. We drew peripheral blood for ribonucleic acid isolation at the sepsis protocol activation, obtained gene expression measures with the GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array, and conducted differential expression analysis. RESULTS: We collected ribonucleic acid samples from a convenience sample of 122 children with suspected sepsis and 12 healthy controls. We compared the 66 children (54%) with confirmed bacterial or viral infection and found 558 differentially expressed genes, many related to interferon signaling or viral immunity. We did not find statistically significant gene expression differences in patients according to sepsis severity. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates feasibility of evaluating gene expression profiling data in children evaluated for sepsis in the pediatric emergency department setting. Our results suggest that gene expression profiling may facilitate identification of source pathogen in children with suspected sepsis, which could ultimately lead to improved tailoring of sepsis treatment and antimicrobial stewardship.",
