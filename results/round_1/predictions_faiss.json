CTCL has long been hypothesized to be caused or perpetuated by chronic antigen stimulation due to unknown exposures. These antigenic triggers, defined as any element that may cause activation of malignant T cells through TCR signaling, have been hypothesized to range from chemicals to microbes.

        "abstract": "We present a patient with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis caused by an aggressive A4S mutation in the SOD1 gene. In 2020, the patient was enrolled in the VALOR SOD1 gene therapy phase-3 trial. At screening, the ALSFRS-R score was 41 (48 is normal) and the level of CSF-neurofilament L (an indicator of ongoing neuronal damage) was 11 000 ng/L (ref <650 ng/L). In the four years following enrollment, the patient received monthly intrathecal treatment with tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide compound that inhibits SOD1 protein expression and hence lowers the synthesis of toxic SOD1 protein species. Side effects have been minimal and mostly attributed to the spinal taps. The patient remains ambulatory with an active social lifestyle. The ALSFRS-R score has in the past 18 months stabilized around 35-37, CSF-NfL is 1\u2009290 ng/L and plasma-NfL is 12 (reference <13).

        "abstract": "Despite extensive research, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a progressive and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease. Limited knowledge of the underlying causes of ALS has made it difficult to target upstream biological mechanisms of disease, and therapeutic interventions are usually administered relatively late in the course of disease. Genetic forms of ALS offer a unique opportunity for therapeutic development, as genetic associations may reveal potential insights into disease etiology. Genetic ALS may also be amenable to investigating earlier intervention given the possibility of identifying clinically presymptomatic, at-risk individuals with causative genetic variants. There is increasing evidence for a presymptomatic phase of ALS, with biomarker data from the Pre-Symptomatic Familial ALS (Pre-fALS) study showing that an elevation in blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) precedes phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease. Tofersen is an investigational antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce synthesis of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein through degradation of SOD1 mRNA. Informed by Pre-fALS and the tofersen clinical development program, the ATLAS study (NCT04856982) is designed to evaluate the impact of initiating tofersen in presymptomatic carriers of SOD1 variants associated with high or complete penetrance and rapid disease progression who also have biomarker evidence of disease activity (elevated plasma NfL). The ATLAS study will investigate whether tofersen can delay the emergence of clinically manifest ALS. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first interventional trial in presymptomatic ALS and has the potential to yield important insights into the design and conduct of presymptomatic trials, identification, and monitoring of at-risk individuals, and future treatment paradigms in ALS.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to pyrethroids, a significant class of the most widely used agricultural chemicals, has been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, although many different pyrethroids induce roughly the same symptoms of Parkinsonism, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To find the shared key features among these mechanisms, we focused on 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common and prominent metabolite of most pyrethroids produced via hydrolysis by CEs in mammals. To determine the contribution of 3-PBA to the initiation and progression of PD, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively, and found that 3-PBA not only accumulates in murine brain tissues over time but also further induces PD-like pathologies (increased \u03b1-syn and phospho-S129, decreased TH) to the same or even greater extent than the precursor pyrethroid. A before-after study of PET-DAT in the same mice revealed that low concentrations of 3-PBA (0.5 mg/kg) could paradoxically cause DAT to increase (22.46% higher than pre-drug test). The intervention of DAT inhibitors and activators respectively alleviated and enhanced the dopaminergic toxicity of 3-PBA, indicating that 3-PBA interacts with DAT. In particular, low concentrations of 3-PBA increase the DAT, which in turn induces 3-PBA to enter the dopaminergic neurons to exert toxic effects. Finally, we described a mechanism underlying this potential role of 3-PBA in the pathological aggregation of \u03b1-syn. Specifically, 3-PBA was found to dysregulate C/EBP \u03b2 levels and further anomalously activate AEP in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by increased accumulation of pathologically cleaved \u03b1-syn (N103 fragments) and accelerated \u03b1-syn aggregation. All these results suggest that 3-PBA exposure could mimic the pathological and pathogenetic features of PD, showing that this metabolite is a key pathogenic compound in pyrethroid-related pathological effects and a possible dopamine neurotoxin. Additionally, our findings provide a crucial reference for the primary prevention of PD.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To study the metabolic mechanism of neonatal sepsis at different stages by analyzing the metabolic pathways involving the serum metabolites with significant differences in neonates with sepsis at different time points after admission. METHODS: A total of 20 neonates with sepsis who were hospitalized in the Department of Neonatology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, from January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2020 were enrolled as the sepsis group. Venous blood samples were collected on days 1, 4, and 7 after admission. Ten healthy neonates who underwent physical examination during the same period were enrolled as the control group. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for the metabonomic analysis of serum samples to investigate the change in metabolomics in neonates with sepsis at different time points. RESULTS: On day 1 after admission, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between the sepsis and control groups were mainly involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid skeleton. For the sepsis group, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 4 after admission were mainly involved in pyruvate metabolism, and those between days 4 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in the metabolism of cysteine and methionine. The differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in ascorbic acid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic mechanism of serum metabolites varies at different stages in neonates with sepsis and is mainly associated with terpenoid skeleton biosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism, cysteine/methionine metabolism, and ascorbic acid metabolism.

        "title": "Oncolytic viruses as a promising therapeutic strategy against the detrimental health impacts of air pollution: The case of glioblastoma multiforme.",
        "abstract": "Human livelihood highly depends on applying different sources of energy whose utilization is associated with air pollution. On the other hand, air pollution may be associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Unlike other environmental causes of cancer (e.g., irradiation), air pollution cannot efficiently be controlled by geographical borders, regulations, and policies. The unavoidable exposure to air pollution can modify cancer incidence and mortality. GBM treatment with chemotherapy or even its surgical removal has proven insufficient (100% recurrence rate; patient's survival mean of 15 months; 90% fatality within five years) due to glioma infiltrative and migratory capacities. Given the barrage of attention and research investments currently plowed into next-generation cancer therapy, oncolytic viruses are perhaps the most vigorously pursued. Provision of an insight into the current state of the research and future direction is essential for stimulating new ideas with the potentials of filling research gaps. This review manuscript aims to overview types of brain cancer, their burden, and different causative agents. It also describes why air pollution is becoming a concerning factor. The different opinions on the association of air pollution with brain cancer are reviewed. It tries to address the significant controversy in this field by hypothesizing the air-pollution-brain-cancer association via inflammation and atopic conditions. The last section of this review deals with the oncolytic viruses, which have been used in, or are still under clinical trials for GBM treatment. Engineered adenoviruses (i.e., DNX-2401, DNX-2440, CRAd8-S-pk7 loaded Neural stem cells), herpes simplex virus type 1 (i.e., HSV-1 C134, HSV-1 rQNestin34.5v.2, HSV-1 G207, HSV-1 M032), measles virus (i.e., MV-CEA), parvovirus (i.e., ParvOryx), poliovirus (i.e., Poliovirus PVSRIPO), reovirus (i.e., pelareorep), moloney murine leukemia virus (i.e., Toca 511 vector), and vaccinia virus (i.e., vaccinia virus TG6002) as possible life-changing alleviations for GBM have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first review that comprehensively discusses both (i) the negative/positive association of air pollution with GBM; and (ii) the application of oncolytic viruses for GBM, including the most recent advances and clinical trials. It is also the first review that addresses the controversies over air pollution and brain cancer association. We believe that the article will significantly appeal to a broad readership of virologists, oncologists, neurologists, environmentalists, and those who work in the field of (bio)energy. Policymakers may also use it to establish better health policies and regulations about air pollution and (bio)fuels exploration, production, and consumption.",

SETTING: Twelve PICUs in Southwest China. PATIENTS: The patients admitted to the PICU from April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023. The age ranged from 28 days to 18 years. All patients met the criteria of severe sepsis or septic shock. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 31 PICUs invited to participate, 12 PICUs (capacity of 292 beds) enrolled patients in the study. During the study period, 11,238 children were admitted to the participating PICUs, 367 (3.3%) of whom met the diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock. The most prevalent sites of infection were the respiratory system (55%) and the digestive system (15%). The primary treatments administered to these patients included antibiotics (100%), albumin (61.3%), invasive mechanical ventilation (58.7%), glucocorticoids (55.6%), blood products (51%), gammaglobulin (51%), and vasoactive medications (46.6%). Sepsis-related mortality in the PICU was 11.2% (41/367). Nearly half of the sepsis deaths occurred within the first 3 days of PICU admission (22/41, 53.7%). The mortality rate of septic shock (32/167, 19.2%) was significantly higher than that of severe sepsis (9/200, 4.5%; p < 0.001). The outcomes of a multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that a higher pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and the use of invasive mechanical ventilation and vasoactive medications were independently associated with PICU mortality in children with sepsis.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Organ dysfunction severity scores (sequential organ failure assessment or SOFA) are commonly used in the adult and pediatric populations when assessing risk of mortality and adverse outcomes from sepsis. In contrast to sepsis definition in adults and children, clinical and laboratory criteria for defining neonatal sepsis have been inconclusive. More recently, studies have attempted to better understand the clinical progression of neonatal sepsis and associated mortality. This data has guided the development of a neonatal SOFA (nSOFA) score, based on common patterns of organ dysfunction observed in this population. RECENT FINDINGS: Although SOFA scores in the adult and pediatric populations have their limitations with moderate sensitivities and specificities depending on the clinical setting, the nSOFA score has been validated in predicting sepsis attributable mortality in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants across several patient cohorts. Furthermore, the nSOFA score has been adapted for use in neonatal disease states, other than sepsis, with similar prognostic utility. SUMMARY: Utilizing an nSOFA scoring system for prediction of sepsis attributable mortality in preterm infants allows for targeted interventions based on risk stratification, as well as better delineation of neonatal sepsis with subsequent improvements in research and patient safety outcomes.",

These disabilities are due to the neurological disorders which affects brain functions. Early diagnosis of these disabilities in kids from age 3 to 6 will help to start early medical treatments and get them back to the normal condition. MATERIAL AND METHOD: we developed a software-based Learning Disability Evaluation Kit called YALU with computer Game Modules for kids targeting their learning disabilities. These Computer game-based modules of the YALU consist of different tasks for the different age levels to identify the symptoms of the disabilities mentioned above. The children's interaction results to each task of the game modules with the answers of the questioner about the children given by the parents will be evaluated with the threshold values given by a panel of consultant psychologist and paediatrician of the normal kids to identify the learning disabilities in kids aged 3-6\u2009years. The result will be given to the respective parties and uploaded to the Website under the child's name. RESULT: YALU has been tested using 50 students in age 3-5 in three preschools. The teachers have identified Fourteen students with some learning disability symptoms. Using YALU, twelve out of fourteen students had been clearly identified.

Given its importance in terms of morbidity and mortality, a number of initiatives by several professional societies in recent years have led to the development of guidelines for the recognition and timely management of sepsis. The principal elements of the most recent guidelines are summarized in this practice point. These elements include recognition of changes in clinical condition and vital signs, such as fever, tachycardia, and changes in peripheral perfusion, which should raise concern for sepsis; initial stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation; timely administration of empiric antimicrobial therapy; use of fluid boluses and vasoactive medications; and specific considerations in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as the use of corticosteroids for possible adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic-adrenal suppression. Two changes from previous guidelines are the concern for fluid overload, implying the need for clinical re-assessment after administration of each fluid bolus, and the removal of dopamine as the initial vasoactive agent for use in hypotensive paediatric patients, with recommendations for the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine as dictated by the clinical context. This practice point focuses primarily on sepsis management in older infants, children, and youth.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can be caused by a broad range of pathogens; however, bacterial infections represent the majority of sepsis cases. Up to 42% of sepsis presentations are culture negative, suggesting a non-bacterial cause. Despite this, diagnosis of viral sepsis remains very rare. Almost any virus can cause sepsis in vulnerable patients (e.g., neonates, infants, and other immunosuppressed groups). The prevalence of viral sepsis is not known, nor is there enough information to make an accurate estimate. The initial standard of care for all cases of sepsis, even those that are subsequently proven to be culture negative, is the immediate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the absence of definite diagnostic criteria for viral sepsis, or at least to exclude bacterial sepsis, this inevitably leads to unnecessary antimicrobial use, with associated consequences for antimicrobial resistance, effects on the host microbiome and excess healthcare costs. It is important to understand non-bacterial causes of sepsis so that inappropriate treatment can be minimised, and appropriate treatments can be developed to improve outcomes. In this review, we summarise what is known about viral sepsis, its most common causes, and how the immune responses to severe viral infections can contribute to sepsis. We also discuss strategies to improve our understanding of viral sepsis, and ways we can integrate this new information into effective treatment.",

In this study, deep learning algorithms were used to predict the mortality of suspected infected patients in a hospital emergency department. During January 2007 and December 2013, 42,220 patients considered in this study were admitted to the emergency department due to suspected infection. In the present study, a deep learning structure for mortality prediction of septic patients was developed and compared with several machine learning methods as well as two sepsis screening tools: the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA). The mortality predictions were explored for septic patients who died within 72 h and 28 days. Results demonstrated that the accuracy rate of deep learning methods, especially Convolutional Neural Network plus SoftMax (87.01% in 72 h and 81.59% in 28 d), exceeds that of the other machine learning methods, SIRS, and qSOFA. We expect that deep learning can effectively assist medical staff in early identification of critical patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Because of difference in local epidemiology and possible variation with time, regular monitoring and updates on pathogen and their antimicrobial sensitivity pattern is important for prevention and treatment. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was carried out among cases of neonatal sepsis admitted in neonatal intermediate care unit of Kanti Children's hospital from August 2014 to August 2015. The data was collected from medical records of neonatal intermediate care unit and microbiology department and analyzed using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: There were 644 admissions, among which 210 (32%)were suspected of having neonatal sepsis. Thirty(14%) of the suspected cases had positive blood culture. Proportions of late and early onset were 25 (83.3%) and 5(17.7%) respectively.In blood culture Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism(80%),followed by Coagulase negative Staphylococcus (6.66%), Acinetobacter (6.66%), Enterobacter species(3.33%) and Morgonellamorgoni (3.33.5%).Gram positive organisms were isolated in all cases of early onset sepsis and in 84% of late onset sepsis. Most of the isolated organisms showed sensitivity to amikacin, cloxacillin, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS: This study has indicated possible emergence of Staphylococcus aureus as the dominant cause of neonatal sepsis. Cloxacillin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin have high proportion of efficacy against the commonly isolated bacteria in neonatal sepsis.",

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms \"sepsis,\" \"septicemia,\" or \"septic shock\" in the title or abstract. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Strong associations of several markers of organ dysfunction with the outcomes of interest among infected and septic children support their inclusion in the data validation phase of the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce.",

        "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare disability causing female-oriented pediatric neurodevelopmental unmet medical need. RTT was recognized in 1966. However, over the past 56 years, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has authorized no effective treatment for RTT. Recently, Trofinetide was approved by the USFDA on 10 March 2023 as the first RTT treatment. This article underlines the pharmaceutical advancement, patent literature, and prospects of Trofinetide. The data for this study were gathered from the PubMed database, authentic websites (Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Neuren Pharmaceuticals, and USFDA), and free patent databases. Trofinetide was first disclosed by Neuren Pharmaceuticals in 2000 as a methyl group containing analog of the naturally occurring neuroprotective tripeptide called glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE). The joint efforts of Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Neuren Pharmaceuticals have developed Trofinetide. The mechanism of action of Trofinetide is not yet well established. However, it is supposed to improve neuronal morphology and synaptic functioning. The patent literature revealed a handful of inventions related to Trofinetide, providing excellent and unexplored broad research possibilities with Trofinetide. The development of innovative Trofinetide-based molecules, combinations of Trofinetide, patient-compliant drug formulations, and precise MECP2-mutation-related personalized medicines are foreseeable. Trofinetide is in clinical trials for some neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including treating Fragile X syndrome (FXS). It is expected that Trofinetide may be approved for treating FXS in the future. The USFDA-approval of Trofinetide is one of the important milestones for RTT therapy and is the beginning of a new era for the therapy of RTT, FXS, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), brain injury, stroke, and other NDDs.",

Epidemiological data about sepsis from the 2017 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factor Study showed that the global burden of sepsis was greater than previously estimated. Bacteria have been shown to be the predominant pathogen of sepsis among patients with pathogens detected, while sepsis caused by viruses is underdiagnosed worldwide. The coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 in China and now in many other countries has brought viral sepsis back into the vision of physicians and researchers worldwide. Although the current understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis has improved, the differences between viral and bacterial sepsis at the level of pathophysiology are not well understood. Diagnosis methods that can broadly differentiate between bacterial and viral sepsis at the initial stage after the development of sepsis are limited. New treatments that can be applied at clinics for sepsis are scarce and this situation is not consistent with the growing understanding of pathophysiology.

        "abstract": "Most minors and young transgender persons wishing to undergo gender-affirming surgery need to seek specialists affiliated with gender affirmation programs in adult hospitals. Research suggests gender affirmation surgery has been established as an effective and medically indicated treatment for gender dysphoria. Although most data on gender-affirming surgeries are from adult populations, there is growing literature establishing their effectiveness in adolescents and young adults. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the perioperative outcomes for gender-diverse youth to deliver safe and affirming care. The primary objective of this retrospective case series is to examine the perioperative characteristics and outcomes of patients with gender identity disorders (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10-code F64) who underwent chest reconstruction (mastectomy) and genital surgery (phalloplasty, metoidioplasty, and vaginoplasty) in a pediatric academic hospital. The secondary aim is to evaluate the value of a specialized anesthesia team for improving clinical outcomes, interdisciplinary communication, and further advancing the transgender perioperative experience. We identified 204 gender affirmation surgical cases, 177 chests/top surgeries, and 27 genital/bottom surgeries. These findings indicate gender-diverse individuals who underwent life-changing surgery at our institution had a median age of 18 years old, with many patients identifying as transmen. Our data suggests that postoperative pain was significant, but adverse events were minimal. The evolution of a specialty anesthesia team and initiatives (anesthesia management guidelines, scheduling, continuity, and education) necessitate direct care coordination and multidisciplinary planning for gender affirmation surgery in transgender youth.",

        "title": "Intimate partner violence and maternal health services utilization: evidence from 36 National Household Surveys.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High rates of maternal mortality and intimate partner violence (IPV) are both major worldwide health challenges. Evidence from single-country samples suggests that IPV may be an important risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services, but there is little large-scale evidence on this association. This paper evaluates whether IPV is a risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services in a large cross-country sample, and also compiles evidence on the relative effects of different forms of IPV. METHODS: We analyze the association between intimate partner violence\u00a0and utilization of maternal health care, using a dataset compiling all Demographic and Health Surveys that report data on intimate partner violence. Using data on 166,685 women observed in 36 countries between 2005 and 2016, we estimate logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between lifetime experience of IPV and utilization of antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery care, and postnatal care. We estimate both unadjusted models and models adjusted for geographic and sociodemographic characteristics that are generally correlated with utilization of maternal health care (including age, education, number of children, wealth status, marital status, and urbanity). RESULTS: Lifetime experience of any IPV is associated with decreased use of maternal health services in a broad sample of births observed in lower and middle-income countries: in particular, the utilization of four or more ANC visits, the number of ANC visits, and the utilization of facility care at birth. This association remains statistically significant even after adjusting for country of residence, subnational region of residence, and additional individual-level covariates; however, there is no statistically significant association between experience of any IPV and postnatal care. The only form of IPV significantly associated with care utilization is physical IPV. CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing physical intimate partner violence show lower levels of utilization of maternal health services in a large sample of developing and middle-income countries. Given that reduced utilization of maternal health services is correlated with maternal and neonatal health outcomes, this pattern suggests that IPV prevention may be an important component of interventions targeting enhanced maternal and neonatal health.",

        "abstract": "Immunotherapies demand for predictive biomarkers to avoid unnecessary adverse effects and costs. Analytic morphomics is the technique to use body composition measures as imaging biomarkers for underlying pathophysiology to predict prognosis or outcome to therapy.\u00a0We investigated different body composition measures to predict response to immunotherapy. This IRB approved retrospective analysis encompassed 147 patients with ipilimumab therapy. Degree of macroangiopathy was quantified with the newly defined total plaque index (TPI), i.e. the body height corrected sum of the soft and hard plaque volume of the infrarenal aorta on portalvenous CT scans. Furthermore, mean psoas density (MPD), different adipose tissue parameters as well as degree of cerebral microangiopathy were extracted from the imaging data. Subsequent multivariate Cox regression analysis encompassed TPI, MPD, serum LDH, S100B, age, gender, number of immunotherapy cycles as well as extent of distant metastases. TPI and MPD correlated positively with PFS in multivariate analysis (p\u2009=\u20090.03 and p\u2009=\u20090.001, respectively). Furthermore, single visceral organ and/or soft tissue involvement significantly decreased progression risk (p\u2009=\u20090.01), whereas increased S100B level showed a trend towards PFS shortening (p\u2009=\u20090.05). In conclusion, degree of macroangiopathy and sarcopenia were independent predictors for outcome to immunotherapy and of equivalent significance compared to other clinical biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in incidence, etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture confirmed infections in hospitalized infants in a large tertiary neonatal unit in South Africa. METHODS: Single-center, retrospective review of laboratory records of bacteria and fungi, and their susceptibility profiles, isolated from blood and CSF of infants hospitalized in the neonatal unit at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa, from 1st January 2010 to 31st December 2019. Laboratory data on isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were collected. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Corynebacteria and Bacillus spp. were excluded. Patient-level clinical and laboratory data were not available. RESULTS: There were 8,319 significant isolates, giving an infection rate of 14.3/1000 patient-days. Infection rates increased from 12.0 to 15.7/1000 patient-days (estimated average yearly change 0.6[95%CI, 0.5-0.7];p = <0.001). Gram-negative infection rates increased from 4.3 to 10.8/1000 patient-days (estimated average yearly change 0.7[95%CI,0.6-0.8];p = <0.001). The 2 most commonly isolated Gram-negative organisms were Acinetobacter baumannii (44%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (39%). Carbapenem resistance was seen in 31% of all Gram-negatives and increased over time (estimated average yearly change 4.8%[95%CI,4.2%-5.3%];p<0.001). Gram-positive infection rates decreased (estimated average yearly change -0.1[95%CI,-0.2- -0.05];p = <0.001). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram-positive isolated. Rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus decreased from 91% to 55%(estimated average yearly change -2.8%[95%CI,-3.5%-2%],p< 0.001). Rates of fungal isolates decreased (estimated average yearly change -0.06[95%CI,-0.1 --0.02]);p = 0.007). Candida parapsilosis (52%) and Candida albicans (35%) were the most common fungi isolated. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a marked overall increase in rates of blood and/or CSF infections, with an absolute increase in Gram-negative infections observed, replacing Gram-positive and fungal pathogens. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase Gram-negative isolates are being replaced by carbapenem resistance, with around one third of all significant Gram-negative isolates now carbapenem resistant. Research into hospital based novel treatment and prevention interventions for neonatal sepsis should be urgently prioritized.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Previous studies applying Sepsis-3 criteria to children were based on retrospective analyses of PICU cohorts. We aimed to compare organ dysfunction criteria in children with blood culture-proven sepsis, including emergency department, PICU, and ward patients, and to assess relevance of organ dysfunctions for mortality prediction. DESIGN: We have carried out a nonprespecified, secondary analysis of a prospective dataset collected from September 2011 to December 2015. SETTING: Emergency departments, wards, and PICUs in 10 tertiary children's hospitals in Switzerland. PATIENTS: Children younger than 17 years old with blood culture-proven sepsis. We excluded preterm infants and term infants younger than 7 days old. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC), Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2), pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA), and Pediatric Organ Dysfunction Information Update Mandate (PODIUM) scores, measured at blood culture sampling, to predict 30-day mortality. We analyzed 877 sepsis episodes in 807 children, with a 30-day mortality of 4.3%. Percentage with organ dysfunction ranged from 32.7% (IPSCC) to 55.3% (pSOFA). In adjusted analyses, the accuracy for identification of 30-day mortality was area under the curve (AUC) 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82-0.92) for IPSCC, 0.83 (0.76-0.89) for PELOD-2, 0.85 (0.78-0.92) for pSOFA, and 0.85 (0.78-0.91) for PODIUM. When restricting scores to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction, the adjusted AUC was 0.89 (0.84-0.94) for IPSCC, 0.85 (0.79-0.91) for PELOD-2, 0.87 (0.81-0.93) for pSOFA, and 0.88 (0.83-0.93) for PODIUM. CONCLUSIONS: IPSCC, PELOD-2, pSOFA, and PODIUM performed similarly to predict 30-day mortality. Simplified scores restricted to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction yielded comparable performance.",

Diet and nu-trition, coupled with proper physical activity have a significant impact on the health status of the elderly with a decreased risk of disease being indicative of successful aging. Musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia are the most frequently reported disorders among the elderly community. METHODS: This study presents a systematic review of the literature on the potential benefits of several nutra-ceuticals in promoting healthy aging and in reducing the risk of chronic diseases in elderly individuals. RESULTS: Dietary components including vitamins (vitamin C, B vitamin and vitamin K) flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, anthocyanins, and isoflavones), minerals (e.g., magnesium, zinc and potassium) and other nutrients such phytoestrogens, amino acids, and omega-3 fatty acids help in slowing the aging process, which ultimately results in increased lifespan and longevity. CONCLUSIONS: This paper highlights the key nutrients and phytochemicals of nutraceutical importance for the healthy aging of the elderly population. Although the scientific literature provides evidences of therapeutic effectiveness of nutraceuticals, more in-depth clinical investigations are needed.",

        "abstract": "Current research on personality disorders strives to identify key behavioural and cognitive facets of patient functioning, to unravel the underlying root causes and maintenance mechanisms. This process often involves the application of social paradigms - however, these often only include momentary affective depictions rather than unfolding interactions. This constitutes a limitation in our capacity to probe core symptoms, and leaves potential findings uncovered which could help those who are in close relationships with affected individuals. Here, we deployed a novel task in which subjects interact with four unknown virtual partners in a turn-taking paradigm akin to a dance, and report on their experience with each. The virtual partners embody four combinations of low/high expressivity of positive/negative mood. Higher scores on our symptomatic measures of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were all linked to a general negative appraisal of all the interpersonal experiences. Moreover, the negative appraisal of the partner who displayed a high negative/low positive mood was tied with attachment anxiety and BPD symptoms. The extent to which subjects felt responsible for causing partners' distress was most strongly linked to attachment anxiety. Finally, we provide a fully-fledged exploration of move-by-move action latencies and click distances from partners. This analysis underscored slower movement initiation from anxiously attached individuals throughout all virtual interactions. In summary, we describe a novel paradigm for second-person neuroscience, which allowed both the replication of established results and the capture of new behavioural signatures associated with attachment anxiety, and discuss its limitations.",

To minimize functional impairments, the use of resveratrol as a therapeutic strategy is highlighted due to its neuroprotective and antioxidant effects in different regions of the brain. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of neonatal treatment with resveratrol on postural development, motor function, oxidative balance, and mitochondrial biogenesis in the brain of rats submitted to a cerebral palsy model. Neonatal treatment with resveratrol attenuated deficits in somatic growth, postural development, and muscle strength in rats submitted to cerebral palsy. Related to oxidative balance, resveratrol in cerebral palsy decreased the levels of MDA and carbonyls. Related to mitochondrial biogenesis, was observed in animals with cerebral palsy treated with resveratrol, an increase in mRNA levels of TFAM, in association with the increase of citrate synthase activity. The data demonstrated a promising effect of neonatal resveratrol treatment, improving postural and muscle deficits induced by cerebral palsy.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The involvement of B-cells in multiple sclerosis has only recently emerged. Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the B-cell antigen CD20 with enhanced B-cell targeting. AREAS COVERED: This evaluation is of the identical ULTIMATE (UbLiTuximab In Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Effects) I and II trials comparing ublituximab (TG-1101) and teriflunomide in relapsing multiple sclerosis. The primary efficacy end point was the annualized relapse rate and was lower in the ublituximab than the teriflunomide group. EXPERT OPINION: The continuation rates to oral teriflunomide in ULTIMATE were higher than in other trials, possibly because of the supervised double-dummy protocol used with intravenous ublituximab. This may have contributed to the higher efficacy with teriflunomide in this trial than previously reported. Nevertheless, ublituximab was more effective than teriflunomide at reducing the annualized relapse rates and MRI endpoints, but not for no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the ULTIMATE trials did show that ublituximab was superior to teriflunomide in NEDA. Long-term studies of the adverse effects of ublituximab are required. Despite the positive results from ULTIMATE for ublituximab, it is still under the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and conclusions should await their findings.",

        "title": "Oncolytic viruses as a promising therapeutic strategy against the detrimental health impacts of air pollution: The case of glioblastoma multiforme.",
        "abstract": "Human livelihood highly depends on applying different sources of energy whose utilization is associated with air pollution. On the other hand, air pollution may be associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Unlike other environmental causes of cancer (e.g., irradiation), air pollution cannot efficiently be controlled by geographical borders, regulations, and policies. The unavoidable exposure to air pollution can modify cancer incidence and mortality. GBM treatment with chemotherapy or even its surgical removal has proven insufficient (100% recurrence rate; patient's survival mean of 15 months; 90% fatality within five years) due to glioma infiltrative and migratory capacities. Given the barrage of attention and research investments currently plowed into next-generation cancer therapy, oncolytic viruses are perhaps the most vigorously pursued. Provision of an insight into the current state of the research and future direction is essential for stimulating new ideas with the potentials of filling research gaps. This review manuscript aims to overview types of brain cancer, their burden, and different causative agents. It also describes why air pollution is becoming a concerning factor. The different opinions on the association of air pollution with brain cancer are reviewed. It tries to address the significant controversy in this field by hypothesizing the air-pollution-brain-cancer association via inflammation and atopic conditions. The last section of this review deals with the oncolytic viruses, which have been used in, or are still under clinical trials for GBM treatment. Engineered adenoviruses (i.e., DNX-2401, DNX-2440, CRAd8-S-pk7 loaded Neural stem cells), herpes simplex virus type 1 (i.e., HSV-1 C134, HSV-1 rQNestin34.5v.2, HSV-1 G207, HSV-1 M032), measles virus (i.e., MV-CEA), parvovirus (i.e., ParvOryx), poliovirus (i.e., Poliovirus PVSRIPO), reovirus (i.e., pelareorep), moloney murine leukemia virus (i.e., Toca 511 vector), and vaccinia virus (i.e., vaccinia virus TG6002) as possible life-changing alleviations for GBM have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first review that comprehensively discusses both (i) the negative/positive association of air pollution with GBM; and (ii) the application of oncolytic viruses for GBM, including the most recent advances and clinical trials. It is also the first review that addresses the controversies over air pollution and brain cancer association. We believe that the article will significantly appeal to a broad readership of virologists, oncologists, neurologists, environmentalists, and those who work in the field of (bio)energy. Policymakers may also use it to establish better health policies and regulations about air pollution and (bio)fuels exploration, production, and consumption.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High rates of maternal mortality and intimate partner violence (IPV) are both major worldwide health challenges. Evidence from single-country samples suggests that IPV may be an important risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services, but there is little large-scale evidence on this association. This paper evaluates whether IPV is a risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services in a large cross-country sample, and also compiles evidence on the relative effects of different forms of IPV. METHODS: We analyze the association between intimate partner violence\u00a0and utilization of maternal health care, using a dataset compiling all Demographic and Health Surveys that report data on intimate partner violence. Using data on 166,685 women observed in 36 countries between 2005 and 2016, we estimate logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between lifetime experience of IPV and utilization of antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery care, and postnatal care. We estimate both unadjusted models and models adjusted for geographic and sociodemographic characteristics that are generally correlated with utilization of maternal health care (including age, education, number of children, wealth status, marital status, and urbanity). RESULTS: Lifetime experience of any IPV is associated with decreased use of maternal health services in a broad sample of births observed in lower and middle-income countries: in particular, the utilization of four or more ANC visits, the number of ANC visits, and the utilization of facility care at birth. This association remains statistically significant even after adjusting for country of residence, subnational region of residence, and additional individual-level covariates; however, there is no statistically significant association between experience of any IPV and postnatal care. The only form of IPV significantly associated with care utilization is physical IPV. CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing physical intimate partner violence show lower levels of utilization of maternal health services in a large sample of developing and middle-income countries. Given that reduced utilization of maternal health services is correlated with maternal and neonatal health outcomes, this pattern suggests that IPV prevention may be an important component of interventions targeting enhanced maternal and neonatal health.",

        "abstract": "The present study examined genetic, prenatal, and postnatal environmental pathways in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and depressive symptoms from parents to early adolescents (when these symptoms start to increase), while considering timing effects of exposure to parent anxiety and depressive symptoms postnatally. The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Overrepresentation analysis (ORA) is used widely to assess the enrichment of functional categories in a gene list compared to a background list. ORA is therefore a critical method in the interpretation of 'omics data, relating gene lists to biological functions and themes. Although ORA is hugely popular, we and others have noticed two potentially undesired behaviours of some ORA tools. The first one we call the 'background problem', because it involves the software eliminating large numbers of genes from the background list if they are not annotated as belonging to any category. The second one we call the 'false discovery rate problem', because some tools underestimate the true number of parallel tests conducted. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate the impact of these issues on several real RNA-seq datasets and use simulated RNA-seq data to quantify the impact of these problems. We show that the severity of these problems depends on the gene set library, the number of genes in the list, and the degree of noise in the dataset. These problems can be mitigated by changing packages/websites for ORA or by changing to another approach such as functional class scoring.

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) is a relatively new treatment for pediatric leukemia and has been the focus of recent advancements. CAR is manufactured to express T cells through various ways such as using retroviruses, transposons and transposase, electroporation, and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Together, it provides flexibility since it recognizes proteins without the need of antigen processing and presentation, can recognize carbohydrates and lipids, and it has been proven to be cost-effective. Despite these benefits however, problems faced by this therapy include unrecognized tumor proteins possibly escaping the system, CAR T cell expression being transient, and the therapy being one of the most expensive cancer drug ever approved. As a result, recent progress has been ongoing where researchers have combined CAR-T cells with natural killer (NK) cells and different cytokines to maximize its efficacy and potency while limiting potential risks such as cytokine release syndrome. Consequently, these cells gained the ability to be universal-being able to be used to treat multiple patients, maintain viability for a longer period, and prevent relapse.",

Data collected by WHO are complemented by case reports and scientific publications. During 2011-2020, 49 cases of HAT were diagnosed in 16 non-endemic countries across five continents: 35 cases were caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, mainly in tourists visiting wildlife areas in eastern and southern Africa, and 14 cases were due to T. b. gambiense, mainly in African migrants originating from or visiting endemic areas in western and central Africa. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: HAT diagnosis in non-endemic countries is rare and can be challenging, but alertness and surveillance must be maintained to contribute to WHO's elimination goals.

Risk factors for obesity and cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, poor regulation of stress, low HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance are among the physical health repercussions we see. The psychological health effects comprise suicidal tendencies and symptoms of depression which are associated with digital device dependency, screen-time-induced poor sleep quality, and content-influenced negativity.

We conducted a scoping review to describe all outcomes that have been reported in cell therapy studies for CP to date, and to examine what instruments were used to capture these. Through a systematic search we identified 54 studies comprising 2066 participants that were treated with a range of cell therapy interventions. We categorized the reported 53 unique outcome instruments and additional descriptive measures into 10 categories and 12 sub-categories. Movement and Posture was the most frequently reported outcome category, followed by Safety, however Quality of Life, and various prevalent comorbidities and complications of CP were infrequently reported. Notably, many outcome instruments used do not have evaluative properties and thus are not suitable for measuring change following intervention.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AIMS: The targeting of solid cancers with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells faces many technological hurdles, including selection of optimal target antigens. Promising pre-clinical and clinical data of CAR T-cell activity have emerged from targeting surface antigens such as GD2 and B7H3 in childhood cancer neuroblastoma. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is expressed in a majority of neuroblastomas at low antigen density but is largely absent from healthy tissues. METHODS: To explore an alternate target antigen for neuroblastoma CAR T-cell therapy, the authors generated and screened a single-chain variable fragment library targeting ALK extracellular domain to make a panel of new anti-ALK CAR T-cell constructs. RESULTS: A lead novel CAR T-cell construct was capable of specific cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma cells expressing low levels of ALK, but with only weak cytokine and proliferative T-cell responses. To explore strategies for amplifying ALK CAR T cells, the authors generated a co-CAR approach in which T cells received signal 1 from a first-generation ALK construct and signal 2 from anti-B7H3 or GD2 chimeric co-stimulatory receptors. The co-CAR approach successfully demonstrated the ability to avoid targeting single-antigen-positive targets as a strategy for mitigating on-target off-tumor toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further proof of concept for ALK as a neuroblastoma CAR T-cell target.",

Digitally augmented psychological therapies bring potential to increase availability of effective help for children with mental health problems. This study aimed to establish whether therapist-supported, digitally augmented, parent-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could increase the efficiency of treatment without compromising clinical effectiveness and acceptability. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, unblinded, two-arm, multisite, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapist-supported, parent-led CBT using the Online Support and Intervention (OSI) for child anxiety platform compared with treatment as usual for child (aged 5-12 years) anxiety problems in 34 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in England and Northern Ireland. We examined acceptability of OSI plus therapist support via qualitative interviews. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OSI plus therapist support or treatment as usual, minimised by child age, gender, service type, and baseline child anxiety interference. Outcomes were assessed at week 14 and week 26 after randomisation. The primary clinical outcome was parent-reported interference caused by child anxiety at week 26 assessment, using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale-parent report (CAIS-P). The primary measure of health economic effect was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Outcome analyses were conducted blind in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with a standardised non-inferiority margin of 0\u00b733 for clinical analyses. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, 12890382. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2020, and Aug 3, 2022, 706 families (706 children and their parents or carers) were referred to the study information. 444 families were enrolled. Parents reported 255 (58%) child participants' gender to be female, 184 (41%) male, three (<1%) other, and one (<1%) preferred not to report their child's gender. 400 (90%) children were White and the mean age was 9\u00b720 years (SD 1\u00b779). 85% of families for whom clinicians provided information in the treatment as usual group received CBT. OSI plus therapist support was non-inferior for parent-reported anxiety interference on the CAIS-P (SMD 0\u00b701, 95% CI -0\u00b715 to 0\u00b717; p<0\u00b70001) and all secondary outcomes. The mean difference in QALYs across trial arms approximated to zero, and OSI plus therapist support was associated with lower costs than treatment as usual. OSI plus therapist support was likely to be cost effective under certain scenarios, but uncertainty was high. OSI plus therapist support acceptability was good. No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Digitally augmented intervention brought promising savings without compromising outcomes and as such presents a valuable tool for increasing access to psychological therapies and meeting the demand for treatment of child anxiety problems.

        "abstract": "Dependency on digital devices resulting in an ever-increasing daily screen time has subsequently also been the cause of several adverse effects on physical and mental or psychological health. Constant exposure to devices like smartphones, personal computers, and television can severely affect mental health- increase stress and anxiety, for example, and cause various sleep issues in both children as well as adults. Risk factors for obesity and cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, poor regulation of stress, low HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance are among the physical health repercussions we see. The psychological health effects comprise suicidal tendencies and symptoms of depression which are associated with digital device dependency, screen-time-induced poor sleep quality, and content-influenced negativity. Oftentimes it can cause the induction of a state of hyper-arousal, increase stress hormones, desynchronize the body clock or the circadian cycle, alter brain chemistry and create a drag on mental energy and development. With a focus on brain development in children and detrimental effects in both adults and children, this research article goes on to explore the various aspects of screen addiction and excessive screen exposure.",

        "abstract": "The transition metal characteristics of iron allow it to play a fundamental role in several essential aspects of human life such as the transport of oxygen through hemoglobin or the transport of electrons in the mitochondrial respiratory chain coupled to the synthesis of ATP. However, an excess or deficiency of iron is related to certain pathologies. The maintenance of iron homeostasis is essential to avoid certain pathologies related to iron excess or deficiency. The existence of iron deposits in postmortem tissues of Parkinson's patients has been interpreted as evidence that iron plays a fundamental role in the degenerative process of the nigrostriatal system in this disease. The use of iron chelators has been successful in the treatment of diseases such as transfusion-dependent thalassemia and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. However, a clinical study with the iron chelator deferiprone in patients with Parkinson's disease has not shown positive effects but rather worsened clinical symptoms. This suggests that iron may not play a role in the degenerative process of Parkinson's disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence is a prevalent public health issue associated with all-cause maternal mortality. This study investigated the relationship between intimate partner violence, severe acute maternal morbidity in the intensive care unit (ICU), and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study in a hospital in Lima, Peru, with 109 cases (maternal ICU admissions) and 109 controls (obstetric patients not admitted to the ICU). Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and medical record review. Partner violence was assessed using the World Health Organization instrument. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the association between intimate partner violence and severe acute maternal morbidity. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher rate of intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy among cases (58.7%) than controls (27.5%). In multivariate analysis, intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy (aOR 3.83 (95% CI: 1.99-7.37)), being married (3.86 (1.27-11.73)), having <8 antenatal care visits (2.78 (1.14-6.80)), and having previous abortions (miscarriage, therapeutic, or unsafe) (1.69 (1.13-2.51)) were significantly associated with severe acute maternal morbidity. The ICU admission rate was 18.8 (per 1000 live births), and ICU maternal mortality was 1.7%. The perinatal mortality rate was higher in cases (9.3%) than in controls (1.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Intimate partner violence was associated with an increased risk of severe acute maternal morbidity. This suggests a more severe impact of intimate partner violence on pregnancy than has been previously identified.

        "abstract": "Cerebral palsy is a neurodevelopmental disease characterized by postural, motor, and cognitive disorders, being one of the main causes of physical and intellectual disability in childhood. To minimize functional impairments, the use of resveratrol as a therapeutic strategy is highlighted due to its neuroprotective and antioxidant effects in different regions of the brain. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of neonatal treatment with resveratrol on postural development, motor function, oxidative balance, and mitochondrial biogenesis in the brain of rats submitted to a cerebral palsy model. Neonatal treatment with resveratrol attenuated deficits in somatic growth, postural development, and muscle strength in rats submitted to cerebral palsy. Related to oxidative balance, resveratrol in cerebral palsy decreased the levels of MDA and carbonyls. Related to mitochondrial biogenesis, was observed in animals with cerebral palsy treated with resveratrol, an increase in mRNA levels of TFAM, in association with the increase of citrate synthase activity. The data demonstrated a promising effect of neonatal resveratrol treatment, improving postural and muscle deficits induced by cerebral palsy. These findings were associated with improvements in oxidative balance and mitochondrial biogenesis in the brain of rats submitted to cerebral palsy.",

The cohort study described here is designed as a large-scale clinical validation of this previous work. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre observational study will prospectively recruit a total of 1445 newborn infants (all gestations)-1084 with suspected early-or late-onset sepsis, and 361 controls-over 4\u2009years. A small volume of whole blood will be collected from infants with suspected sepsis at the time of presentation. This sample will be used for integrated transcriptomic, lipidomic and targeted proteomics profiling. In addition, a subset of samples will be subjected to cellular phenotype and proteomic analyses. A second sample from the same patient will be collected at 24 hours, with an opportunistic sampling for stool culture. For control infants, only one set of blood and stool sample will be collected to coincide with clinical blood sampling. Along with detailed clinical information, blood and stool samples will be analysed and the information will be used to identify and validate the efficacy of immune-metabolic networks in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal sepsis and to identify new host biomarkers for viral sepsis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received research ethics committee approval from the Wales Research Ethics Committee 2 (reference 19/WA/0008) and operational approval from Health and Care Research Wales.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pyroptosis is closely relevant to sepsis. However, the molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis in pneumonia-induced sepsis are still not fully understood. Thus, this study aimed to find the specific molecular pathways associated with pyroptosis and explore their relationship in pneumonia-induced sepsis. METHODS: First, significant signaling pathways related to pneumonia-induced sepsis were screened by bioinformatics analysis based on GSE48080. The peripheral blood samples from patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis and healthy subjects were collected. Pneumonia-induced sepsis rat models were also established. Then, inflammatory response, pyroptosis, and regulatory T cells (Tregs)/T-helper 17 (Th17), Th1/Th2, and M1/M2 cell ratios in pneumonia-induced sepsis were evaluated. RESULTS: IL-17 signaling pathway was significantly related to pneumonia-induced sepsis by bioinformatics analysis. Compared with healthy groups, the higher of Th17/Treg, Th1/Th2 and M1/M2 cell radios in the patients and sepsis rat model indicated that pneumonia-induced sepsis caused a severe inflammatory response. This result was confirmed by higher levels of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18) and an inflammation indicator (LDH), as well as pyroptosis occurrence in sepsis. Additionally, the up-regulation of key molecules (HMGB1, RAGE, IL-17A, TRAF6 and NK-\u03baB) in the IL-17 signaling pathway suggested the IL-17 pathway was activated. Moreover, the release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and the levels of the molecules (NLRP3, NLRC4, Cleaved caspase-1, and Cleaved GSDMD) associated with caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis were up-regulated in pneumonia-induced sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: As NK-\u03baB activation can promote the development of caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis, these findings suggested that the activation of the IL-17 signaling pathway could promote pyroptosis in pneumonia-induced sepsis.",

The principal elements of the most recent guidelines are summarized in this practice point. These elements include recognition of changes in clinical condition and vital signs, such as fever, tachycardia, and changes in peripheral perfusion, which should raise concern for sepsis; initial stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation; timely administration of empiric antimicrobial therapy; use of fluid boluses and vasoactive medications; and specific considerations in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as the use of corticosteroids for possible adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic-adrenal suppression. Two changes from previous guidelines are the concern for fluid overload, implying the need for clinical re-assessment after administration of each fluid bolus, and the removal of dopamine as the initial vasoactive agent for use in hypotensive paediatric patients, with recommendations for the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine as dictated by the clinical context.

METHODS: Single-center, retrospective cohort study in children with a diagnosis of sepsis visiting the PED and then admitted to the PICU from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019. Sepsis organ dysfunction scores-pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) (Schlapbach, Matics, Shime), quickSOFA, quickSOFA-L, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD)-2, quickPELOD-2, and Pediatric Multiple Organ Dysfunction score-were calculated during the first 24 hours of admission (day 1) and their performance compared with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and severe sepsis-International Consensus Conference on Pediatric Sepsis(ICCPS)-derived criteria-using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Primary outcome was PICU mortality. Secondary outcomes were: a composite of death and new disability (ie, change from baseline Pediatric Overall Performance Category score \u22651); prolonged PICU length of stay (>5 d); prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) (>3 d). RESULTS: Among 60 patients with sepsis, 4 (6.7%) died, 7 (11.7%) developed new disability, 26 (43.3%) experienced prolonged length of stay, and 21 (35%) prolonged invasive MV. The prognostic ability in mortality discrimination was significantly higher for organ dysfunction scores, with PELOD-2 showing the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.924; 95% confidence interval, 0.837-1.000), significantly better than SIRS 3 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P = 0.009), SIRS 4 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P < 0.001), and severe sepsis (0.924 vs 0.527, P < 0.001). Among secondary outcomes, PELOD-2 performed significantly better than SIRS criteria and severe sepsis to predict prolonged duration of invasive MV, whereas better than severe sepsis to predict \"poor outcome\" (mortality or new disability). CONCLUSIONS: Day 1 organ dysfunction scores performed better in predicting mortality and morbidity outcomes than ICCPS-derived criteria.

METHODS: Patients on standard treatment, with unilateral or bilateral lower limb (LL) or combined upper limb (UL)/LL spasticity received four incobotulinumtoxinA injection cycles (16 or 20 Units/kg bodyweight total [maximum 400 or 500 Units] per cycle depending on ambulatory status/clinical pattern treated), each followed by 12-16 weeks' observation. Treatment for pes equinus was mandatory; flexed knee or adducted thigh were options for unilateral treatment and/or ULs for unilateral/bilateral treatment. The primary endpoint was safety; changes in Ashworth Scale and Gross Motor Function Measure-66 scores, and Global Impression of Change Scale scores at week 4 of each injection cycle were also evaluated. RESULTS: IncobotulinumtoxinA (\u2264500 Units for \u226498 weeks) was safe, well-tolerated, and effective across all endpoints for multipattern treatment of LL and combined LL/UL spasticity in ambulant/nonambulant children/adolescents with CP. Treatment effects increased with each injection cycle. No new/unexpected safety concerns were identified.

The aim of the study is to determine the application of SOFA scores as a predictor of outcome in children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with a diagnosis of sepsis. The design involved is prospective observational study. The study took place at the multidisciplinary pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), tertiary care hospital, South India. The patients included are children, aged 1 month to 18 years admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis (suspected/proven) to a single center PICU in India from November 2017 to November 2019. Data collected included the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome-related variables. Severity of illness scores was calculated to include SOFA score day 1 (SF1) and day 3 (SF3) using a pediatric version (pediatric SOFA score or pSOFA) with age-adjusted cutoff variables for organ dysfunction, pediatric risk of mortality III (PRISM III; within 24\u2009hours of admission), and pediatric logistic organ dysfunction-2 or PELOD-2 (days 1, 3, and 5). A total of 240 patients were admitted to the PICU with septic shock during the study period. The overall mortality rate was 42 of 240 patients (17.5%). The majority (59%) required mechanical ventilation, while only 19% required renal replacement therapy. The PRISM III, PELOD-2, and pSOFA scores correlated well with mortality. All three severity of illness scores were higher among nonsurvivors as compared with survivors ( ",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An important problem of our day is the significant increase in the number of learning-disabled pupils all over the world. This has led to the emergence of  OBJECTIVE: This paper analyzes the role and functions of a neuropsychologist in primary schools and the possibilities of his/her collaboration with other specialists in diagnosing children's problems and organizing remediation for problematic kids. DESIGN: We established four steps for launching neuropsychological work at primary schools: 1) setting up a screening group for neuropsychological assessment of all children entering the first year of school; 2) a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of the children who showed poor results in the first step of the study; 3)ateam remediation program; and 4) evaluation of the remediation results by a new neuropsychological assessment at the end of the remediation program. RESULTS: The results of the first step of our study showed a very high percentage of children with cognitive problems- 37% of 202 6-8 year-old schoolchildren entering the first year of school. They formed a group at risk for future learning disabilities and maladjustment at school. Age and gender differences, and the structure of cognitive underdevelopment, were discussed in the second step of our study. In the third step, a team of school specialists, including a neuropsychologist, a teacher, a school psychologist, and a school social worker, implemented a remediation program which was created and supervised by a neuropsychologist. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of the pupils revealed a complex structure of cognitive disturbances which interfere with pupils' learning abilities in primary school. The team approach can efficiently prevent learning disabilities and help children with cognitive underdevelopment and risks of future unsuccess at school, when this collaboration of school specialists has a common theoretical approach and is based upon comprehensive neuropsychological assessment.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) uses the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to grade organ dysfunction in adult patients with suspected infection. However, the SOFA score is not adjusted for age and therefore not suitable for children. OBJECTIVES: To adapt and validate a pediatric version of the SOFA score (pSOFA) in critically ill children and to evaluate the Sepsis-3 definitions in patients with confirmed or suspected infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective observational cohort study included all critically ill children 21 years or younger admitted to a 20-bed, multidisciplinary, tertiary pediatric intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and August 1, 2016. Data on these children were obtained from an electronic health record database. The pSOFA score was developed by adapting the original SOFA score with age-adjusted cutoffs for the cardiovascular and renal systems and by expanding the respiratory criteria to include noninvasive surrogates of lung injury. Daily pSOFA scores were calculated from admission until day 28 of hospitalization, discharge, or death (whichever came first). Three additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were calculated for comparison. EXPOSURES: Organ dysfunction measured by the pSOFA score, and sepsis and septic shock according to the Sepsis-3 definitions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The daily pSOFA scores and additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were compared. Performance was evaluated using the area under the curve. The pSOFA score was then used to assess the Sepsis-3 definitions in the subgroup of children with confirmed or suspected infection. RESULTS: In all, 6303 patients with 8711 encounters met inclusion criteria. Each encounter was treated independently. Of the 8482 survivors of hospital encounters, 4644 (54.7%) were male and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 69 (17-156) months. Among the 229 nonsurvivors, 127 (55.4%) were male with a median (IQR) age of 43 (8-144) months. In-hospital mortality was 2.6%. The maximum pSOFA score had excellent discrimination for in-hospital mortality, with an area under the curve of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92-0.95). The pSOFA score had a similar or better performance than other pediatric organ dysfunction scores. According to the Sepsis-3 definitions, 1231 patients (14.1%) were classified as having sepsis and had a mortality rate of 12.1%, and 347 (4.0%) had septic shock and a mortality rate of 32.3%. Patients with sepsis were more likely to die than patients with confirmed or suspected infection but no sepsis (odds ratio, 18; 95% CI, 11-28). Of the 229 patients who died during their hospitalization, 149 (65.0%) had sepsis or septic shock during their course. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The pSOFA score was adapted and validated with age-adjusted variables in critically ill children. Using the pSOFA score, the Sepsis-3 definitions were assessed in children with confirmed or suspected infection. This study is the first assessment, to date, of the Sepsis-3 definitions in critically ill children. Use of these definitions in children is feasible and shows promising results.",

Bacterial pathogens of neonatal septicemia may vary from one country to another and within a country from one hospital or region to another. Both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria are responsible in neonatal sepsis. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalent bacterial agents of neonatal sepsis and their antimicrobial susceptibility in a teaching hospital, Rasht, from February 2008 to February 2010. METHODS: This prospective study includes 611 newborns admitted with the probable diagnosis of septicemia. We studied the cases with positive blood culture, the pathogens and antibiotic resistance to different antibiotics. FINDINGS: Among 611 hospitalized newborns, 64 (10.6%) cases had positive blood culture. The commonest pathogens were Entrobacter (78.1%) and Klebsiella (6.2%). CONCLUSION: According to the results, low birth weight and prematurity were associated with higher risk of sepsis significantly. The most common pathogen was Enterobacter. Treatment with effective antibiotics (e.g. gentamicin, cost effective and easily available) and hygienic care in the neonatal unit are recommended to eliminate the infectious factors especially Entrobacter.",

Identification of the common bacteria causing such infections and their susceptibility patterns will provide necessary information for timely intervention. This study is aimed at determining the susceptibilities of bacterial etiological agents to commonly-used antimicrobial agents for empirical treatment of suspected bacterial septicaemia in children. METHODS: This is a hospital based retrospective analysis of blood cultures from infants to children up to 14 years of age with preliminary diagnosis of sepsis and admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and Paediatric Wards of the Teaching Hospital Tamale from July 2011 to January 2012. RESULTS: Out of 331 blood specimens cultured, the prevalence of confirmed bacterial sepsis was 25.9% (86/331). Point prevalence for confirmed cases from NICU was 44.4% (28/63) and 21.6% (58/268) from the Paediatric ward. Gram positive cocci (GPC) were the predominant isolates with Coagulase positive (32.2%) and Coagulase-negative (28.7%) Staphylococci accounting for 60.9% of the total isolates. Gram negative rods (GNR) comprised 39.1% of all isolates with Klebsiella, E.coli and Salmonella being the most common organisms isolated. Klebsiella was the most frequent GNR from the NICU and Salmonella typhi was predominantly isolated from the paediatric ward. Acinetobacter showed 100.0% susceptibility to Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime but was resistant (100.0%) to Ampicillin, Tetracycline and Cotrimoxazole. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella were 80.0% and 91.0% susceptible to Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime respectively. Klebsiella species showed 8.3% susceptibility to Tetracycline but was resistant to Ampicillin and Cotrimoxazole. Escherichia coli showed 40.0% susceptibility to Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol and Cotrimoxazole; 20.0% susceptibility to Tetracycline and 80.0% susceptible to Gentamicin and Cefuroxime. Coagulase negative Staphylococci was susceptible to Gentamicin (72.0%) but Coagulase positive Staphylococci showed intermediate sensitivity to Gentamicin (42.9%). CONCLUSION: Coagulase Negative, Coagulase Positive Staphylococci, Salmonella and Klebsiella were the aetiological agents of bloodstream infection among children at TTH. While gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria showed low susceptibility to Ampicillin, Tetracycline and Cotrimoxazole, the GNR were susceptible to Gentamicin and third-generation cephalosporins.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether plasma filtration improves 28-day survival in infants and children with severe sepsis. DESIGN: A multicentre randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care units in teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Forty-eight infants and children with severe sepsis. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive plasma filtration (n = 25) or standard therapy (n = 23) for the treatment of septic shock. The primary outcome measure was 28-day survival. Secondary outcome measures included the number of failed organ systems on Day 7, a requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and the modified Glasgow outcome score (MGOS) at 6 months (where 1 is normal and 6 is dead). RESULTS: The trial was stopped early due to poor recruitment. Patients in the plasma filtration group had higher initial disease severity as measured by serum lactate level, inotrope score and MGOS. Ten (40%) children died in the plasma filtration group and 4 (17%) died in the control group. With intention-to-treat analysis and adjustment for lactate level, ventilation index, inotrope score and MGOS at admission using logistic regression, the odds ratio for death with plasma filtration was 1.20 (95% CI, 0.23-6.20; P = 0.82). The median number of failing organ systems at 7 days was 2 (interquartile range [IQR], 1-4) in the plasma filtration group versus 2 (IQR, 1-3) in the control group. Two children in the plasma filtration group required ECMO for 2.5 and 123 hours, and one child in the control group required ECMO for 45 hours. The median MGOS at 6 months was 4 (IQR, 2-6) in the plasma filtration group and 2 (IQR, 1-4) in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not recruit enough patients to test the hypothesis that addition of plasma filtration to our standard care protocol reduces 28-day mortality in children with severe sepsis. However, mortality in the treatment and control groups was not significantly different after adjustment for severity of illness at the time of randomisation.",

        "abstract": "Analytic morphomics refers to the accurate measurement of specific biological markers of human body composition in diagnostic medical imaging. The increasing prevalence of disease processes that alter body composition including obesity, cachexia, and sarcopenia has generated interest in specific targeted measurement of these metrics to possibly prevent or reduce negative health outcomes. Typical morphomic measurements include the area and density of muscle, bone, vascular calcification, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat on a specific validated axial level in the patient's cross-sectional diagnostic imaging. A distinct advantage of these measurements is that they can be made retrospectively and opportunistically with pre-existing datasets. We provide a narrative review of the current state of art in morphomics, but also consider some potential future directions for this exciting field. Imaging based quantitative assessment of body composition has enormous potential across the breadth and scope of modern clinical practice. From risk stratification to treatment planning, and outcome assessment, all can be enhanced with the use of analytic morphomics. Moreover, it is likely that many new opportunities for personalized medicine will emerge as the field evolves. As radiologists, embracing analytic morphomics will enable us to contribute added value in the care of every patient.",

TMEM proteins carry out a wide variety of functions necessary to maintain cell homeostasis TMEM165 participates in glycosylation protein, TMEM88 in the development of cardiomyocytes, TMEM45A in epidermal keratinization, and TMEM74 regulating autophagy. However, for many TMEM proteins, their physiological function remains unknown. The role of these proteins is being recently investigated in cancer since transcriptomic and proteomic studies have revealed that exits differential expression of TMEM proteins in different neoplasms concerning cancer-free tissues. Among the cellular processes in which TMEM proteins have been involved in cancer are the promotion or suppression of cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, migration, intravasation/extravasation, metastasis, modulation of the immune response, and response to antineoplastic drugs. Inclusive data suggests that the participation of TMEM proteins in these cellular events could be carried out through involvement in different cell signaling pathways. However, the exact mechanisms not clear. This review shows a description of the involvement of TMEM proteins that promote or decrease cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in cancer cells, describes those TMEM proteins for which both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter role have been identified, depending on the type of cancer in which the protein is expressed. As well as some TMEM proteins involved in chemoresistance. A better characterization of these proteins is required to improve the understanding of the tumors in which their expression and function are altered; in addition to improving the understanding of the role of these proteins in cancer will show those TMEM proteins be potential candidates as biomarkers of response to chemotherapy or prognostic biomarkers or as potential therapeutic targets in cancer.",

OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) scoring systems to estimate severity of illness and to characterize the performance characteristics of currently used scoring tools and clinical assessments for organ dysfunction in critically ill children. DATA SOURCES: Electronic searches of PubMed and Embase were conducted from January 1992 to January 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they evaluated critically ill children with MOD, evaluated the performance characteristics of scoring tools for MOD, and assessed outcomes related to mortality, functional status, organ-specific outcomes, or other patient-centered outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were abstracted into a standard data extraction form by a task force member. RESULTS: Of 1152 unique abstracts screened, 156 full text studies were assessed including a total of 54 eligible studies. The most commonly reported scores were the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (PELOD), pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (pSOFA), Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM), PRISM, and counts of organ dysfunction using the International Pediatric Sepsis Definition Consensus Conference. Cut-offs for specific organ dysfunction criteria, diagnostic elements included, and use of counts versus weighting varied substantially. LIMITATIONS: While scores demonstrated an increase in mortality associated with the severity and number of organ dysfunctions, the performance ranged widely. CONCLUSIONS: The multitude of scores on organ dysfunction to assess severity of illness indicates a need for unified and data-driven organ dysfunction criteria, derived and validated in large, heterogenous international databases of critically ill children.",

Following rituximab, second- and third-generation anti-CD20 mAbs have been developed and tried in immune-mediated diseases, including obinutuzumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, and veltuzumab. However, their safety and efficacy has not been systematically reviewed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, and veltuzumab for the treatment of immune-mediated disorders compared to placebo, conventional treatment or other biologics. METHODS: The PRISMA checklist guided the reporting of the data. We searched the PubMed database between 4 October 2016 and 22 July 2021 concentrating on immune-mediated disorders. RESULTS: The literature search identified 2220 articles. After screening titles and abstracts against the inclusion and exclusion criteria and assessing full texts, 27 articles were finally included in a narrative synthesis.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adolescence is crucial period for laying the foundations for healthy development and mental well-being. The increasing prevalence of mental disorders amongst adolescents makes promotion of mental well-being and prevention interventions at schools important. UPRIGHT (Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally implemented in schools to improve and promote mental Health for Teenagers) is designed as a whole school approach (school community, students and families) to promote a culture of mental well-being and prevent mental disorders by enhancing resilience capacities. The present article aims at describing the rationale, conceptual framework, as well as methodology of implementation and evaluation of the UPRIGHT intervention. METHODS: UPRIGHT project is a research and innovation project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement No. 754919 (Duration: 48\u2009months). The theoretical framework has been developed by an innovative and multidisciplinary approach using a co-creation process inside the UPRIGHT Consortium (involving seven institutions from Spain, Italy, Poland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland). Resulted is the UPRIGHT programme with 18 skills related to 4 components: Mindfulness, Coping, Efficacy and Social and Emotional Learning. Among the five Pan-European regions, 34 schools have been currently involved (17 control; 17 intervention) and around 6000 adolescents and their families are foreseen to participate along a 3-year period of evaluation. Effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated as a randomized controlled trial including quantitative and qualitative analysis in the five Pan-European regions representative of the cultural and socioeconomic diversity. The cost-effectiveness assessment will be performed by simulation modelling methods. DISCUSSION: We expect a short- to medium-term improvement of mental well-being in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities. The study may provide robust evidence on intrapersonal, familiar and social environmental resilience factors promoting positive mental well-being.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We evaluated adapting the quick Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment score (fast respiratory rate, altered mental status, low blood pressure) for pediatric use by selecting thresholds from three commonly used definitions: Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2, Pediatric Advanced Life Support, and International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference. We examined their respective performance in identifying children who had a discharge diagnosis of infection at high risk of mortality using PICU registry data, with additional focus on the influence of age on performance. DESIGN: Analysis of retrospective data obtained from the Virtual Pediatric Systems PICU database. The performance in predicting observed mortality was assessed for the three candidate approaches using receiver operating characteristics analysis, including age group effects. SETTING: The Virtual Pediatric Systems database contains data on diagnosis, clinical markers, and outcomes in prospectively collected clinical records from 130 participating PICUs in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: Children who had a discharge diagnosis of infection in a participating PICU between 2009 and 2014, for which all required data were available. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data from 40,228 children revealed an overall mortality of 4.22%. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (95% CI) was 0.760 (0.749-0.771) for Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 with mechanical ventilation, 0.700 (0.689-0.712) for Pediatric Advanced Life Support, and 0.709 (0.696-0.721) for International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference. When split by age group, the performance of Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 with mechanical ventilation was lowest in the youngest neonates (under 1\u2009wk old), with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (95% CI) of 0.724 (0.656-0.791), and in the teenagers (13-18 yr), with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.710 (0.682-0.738), yet it still outperformed Pediatric Advanced Life Support and International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among critically ill children who had a discharge diagnosis of infection in the PICU, quick Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment score performs best when using the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 age thresholds with mechanical ventilation, while all definitions performed worse at extremes of pediatric age. Thus, mortality risk varies with vital sign thresholds, and although Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 with mechanical ventilation performed marginally better, it is unlikely to be of use to clinicians. More work is needed to develop a robust and relevant pediatric sepsis risk score.",

We performed an external validation of the quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2, including its performance in predicting mortality in specific age groups. DESIGN: Analysis of retrospective data obtained from the Virtual Pediatric Systems PICU registry. SETTING: Prospectively collected clinical records from 130 participating PICUs in North America. PATIENTS: Children admitted between January 2009 and December 2014, with a diagnosis of infection at discharge, for whom all required data were available. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Systolic blood pressures, heart rates, and Glasgow Coma Scale scores were used to evaluate the quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Performance was compared with Pediatric Risk of Mortality 3 and Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 risk scores. Data from 42,196 children with complete data were analyzed, with median age 2.7 years (interquartile range, 0.7-8.8 yr; range 0-18 yr) and a 4.27% mortality rate. Mortality was 13.4% for quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 greater than or equal to 2 and 2.5% for quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 less than 2, representing a false-negative rate of 49.5%. Also 311 children (17%) who died had a quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 score of 0. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 72.6% (95% CI, 71.4-73.8%) for quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2, compared with 85.0% (95% CI, 84.0-86.0%) for Pediatric Risk of Mortality 3 and 81.5% (95% CI, 80.5-82.5%) for Pediatric Index of Mortality 2. Performance of quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 was worst in the greater than 12 years age group (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 67.8%; 95% CI, 65-70.5) and best in the less than 1 month age group (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 78.9%; 95% CI, 75.3-82.4). CONCLUSIONS: Quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 performed markedly worse in our cohort, compared with the original study, and the high rate of false negatives limits its clinical utility in our population. Further work is needed to develop a robust quick pediatric sepsis diagnostic tool for both research and clinical care.",

They are mainly expressed during embryonic development and their role during adulthood is very limited. DDR1 has been widely studied in several types of cancers, in atherosclerosis and fibrosis, but also in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review focuses on the role of DDR1 in chronic nephropathies and on the effect of its deletion in the pathological processes involved in renal disease progression. DDR1 was shown to be de novo expressed in several models of experimental CKD. Its genetic or pharmaco-genetic inhibition led to the preservation of renal structure and function, and to decreased inflammatory influx and fibrosis. Furthermore, delayed pharmaco-genetic inhibition of DDR1 led to significant protection in models of renal disease. These results demonstrate the involvement of DDR1 in inflammatory and fibrotic processes occurring during CKD and the beneficial effect of its inhibition. Thus, DDR1 could be an interesting therapeutic target to treat renal pathologies.",

This article will focus on the introduction of CAR-T cell therapy in pediatric B-cell ALL and discuss past and current trials. We will also discuss trials for CAR-T cell therapy in other pediatric malignancies. This information was gathered through a comprehensive literature review along with using first hand institutional experience. Due to the potential severe toxicities related to CAR-T cell therapy, safe practices and monitoring are key. These authors demonstrate that nurses have a profound responsibility in preparing and caring for patients and families, monitoring and managing side effects in these patients, ensuring that study guidelines are followed, and providing continuity for patients, families, and referring providers.

The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among cannabis user in engineering college and associated demographic factors. METHODS: In this study, 100 cannabis-consuming engineering students of (XXX) were selected by snowball sampling. After confirmation of cannabis use and individual selection according to DSM-5 criteria, Beck anxiety and depression inventories were used to access prevalence and severity of anxiety and depression among the participants. Demographic information such as age, gender, education and town of residence were also filled in a research questionnaire for analysis. RESULTS: The overall frequency of people with anxiety in the population of cannabis users was 60% and the overall frequency of people with depression was 33%. The frequency of cannabis users was highest in the age range of 24-25, in men and participants with diploma. The prevalence and severity of anxiety and depression was not significantly associated with age, gender, education and town of residence among the participants, p\u00a0>\u00a00.05.

Constant exposure to devices like smartphones, personal computers, and television can severely affect mental health- increase stress and anxiety, for example, and cause various sleep issues in both children as well as adults. Risk factors for obesity and cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, poor regulation of stress, low HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance are among the physical health repercussions we see. The psychological health effects comprise suicidal tendencies and symptoms of depression which are associated with digital device dependency, screen-time-induced poor sleep quality, and content-influenced negativity. Oftentimes it can cause the induction of a state of hyper-arousal, increase stress hormones, desynchronize the body clock or the circadian cycle, alter brain chemistry and create a drag on mental energy and development.

The manifestations of Parkinson's disease often include resting tremor, stiffness, bradykinesia, and muscular rigidity. The typical hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the destruction of neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies in different compartments of the central nervous system. Due to various limitations to the currently available treatments, immunotherapies have emerged to be the new approach to Parkinson's disease treatment. This approach shows some positive outcomes on the efficacy by removing the aggregated species of alpha-synuclein, which is believed to be one of the causes of Parkinson's disease. In this review, an overview of how alpha-synuclein contributes to Parkinson's disease and the effects of a few new immunotherapeutic treatments, including BIIB054 (cinpanemab), MEDI1341, AFFITOPE, and PRX002 (prasinezumab) that are currently under clinical development, will be discussed.",

We aimed to evaluate the genetic profile of TLR pathway-related key genes; the myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MYD88), IL1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), the nuclear factor kappa-B1 (NFKB1), and interleukin 6 (IL6) in the blood of neonates with sepsis at the time of admission and post-treatment for the available paired-samples. This case-control study included 124 infants with sepsis admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and 17 controls. The relative gene expressions were quantified by TaqMan Real-Time qPCR and correlated to the clinic-laboratory data. MYD88, NFKB1, and IL6 relative expressions were significantly higher in sepsis cases than controls. Higher levels of MYD88 and IL6 were found in male neonates and contributed to the sex-based separation of the cases by the principal component analysis. ROC analysis revealed MYD88 and NFKB1 transcripts to be good biomarkers for sepsis. Furthermore, patients with high circulatory MYD88 levels were associated with poor survival, as revealed by Kaplan-Meier curves analysis. MYD88, NFKB1, and IL6 transcripts showed association with different poor-outcome manifestations. Clustering analysis split the patient cohort into three distinct groups according to their transcriptomic signature and CRP levels.

        "abstract": "Fatigue is defined as a symptom leading to the inability to continue functioning at the expected activity level. It is a highly prevalent symptom, challenging to frame into monodimensional pathophysiological mechanisms. As a result, fatigue is often underestimated in the clinical setting and is wrongly considered an unavoidable consequence of ageing. Several potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue have been proposed, including sleep patterns, autonomic nervous system abnormalities and biological complexity. Inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the most promising mechanisms through which malnutrition may cause fatigue. Not surprisingly, fatigue is highly prevalent in inflammatory conditions (e.g. COVID-19 infection). The nutritional status may also represent a critical factor in the development and presentation of fatigue, which may mimic the exhaustion of the individual's metabolic reserves. For example, the insufficient dietary intake of energy and proteins may determine the catabolism of body fat and muscles, disrupt the homeostatic balance and cause the onset of fatigue. It is necessary to conduct research on fatigue. By characterising its pathophysiological mechanisms, it will be possible to (1) support the design and development of targeted interventions, (2) improve the quality of life of many persons by acting on the symptom and (3) reduce the direct and indirect costs of a burdening condition typical of advancing age. In the present review, we provide an overview of the role that nutrition may play as a determinant of fatigue in older people, also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preterm infants are a special population that vulnerable to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and the lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) caused by RSV could be severe and even life-threating. The purpose of the present study was to identify candidate genes of preterm infants who are susceptible to RSV infection and provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of RSV infection. METHODS: Three datasets (GSE77087, GSE69606 and GSE41374) containing 183 blood samples of RSV infected patients and 33 blood samples of healthy controls from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were downloaded and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out. The function and pathway enrichments were analyzed through Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for DEGs was constructed through Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). The module analysis was performed by Cytoscape software and hub genes were identified. Clinical verification was employed to verify the expression level of top five hub genes among 72 infants including 50 RSV infected patients and 22 non-RSV-infected patients hospitalized in our center. Further, the RSV infected infants with high-expression IFI27 and those with low-expression IFI27 were compared (defined as higher or lower than the median mRNA level). Finally, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) focusing on IFI27 was carried out. RESULTS: Totally, 4028 DEGs were screened out and among which, 131 most significant DEGs were selected. Subsequently, 13 hub genes were identified, and function and pathway enrichments of hub genes mainly were: response to virus, defense response to virus, regulation of viral genome replication and regulation of viral life cycle. Furthermore, IFI27 was confirmed to be the most significantly expressed in clinical verification. Gene sets associated with calcium signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix receptor interaction and so on were significantly enriched when IFI27 was highly expressed. Moreover, high-expression IFI27 was associated with more severe cases (p\u2009=\u20090.041), more requirements of mechanical ventilation (p\u2009=\u20090.034), more frequent hospitalization (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and longer cumulative hospital stay (p\u2009=\u20090.012). CONCLUSION: IFI27 might serve to predict RSV infection and evaluate the severity of RSV infection in preterm infants.",

        "title": "Family Talk versus usual services in improving child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness (PRIMERA-Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parental mental illness is common and can lead to dependent children incurring a high risk of developing mental disorders, physical illness, and impaired educational and occupational outcomes. Family Talk is one of the better known interventions designed to prevent the intergenerational transmission of mental illness. However, its evidence base is small, with few robust independent randomised controlled trials, and no associated process or cost evaluations. The PRIMERA (Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children) research programme involves a mixed method evaluation of Family Talk which is being delivered in mental health settings in Ireland to improve child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness. METHODS: The study comprises a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT), with nested economic and process evaluations, to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness and implementation mechanisms of Family Talk compared to usual services. The study is being conducted in 15 adult and child mental health settings in Ireland. Families with a parent with mental illness, and children aged 5-18\u2009years (n\u2009=\u2009144 families) will be randomised to either the 7-session Family Talk programme (n\u2009=\u200996) or to standard care (n\u2009=\u200948) using a 2:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcomes are child psychosocial functioning and family functioning. Secondary outcomes are as follows: understanding and experience of parental mental illness, parental mental health, child and parental resilience, partner wellbeing and service utilisation. Blind assessments will take place at pre-intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Given the prevalence and burden of intergenerational mental illness, it is imperative that prevention through evidence-based interventions becomes a public health priority. The current study will provide an important contribution to the international evidence base for Family Talk whilst also helping to identify key implementation lessons in the scaling up of Family Talk, and other similar interventions, within routine mental health settings.

        "abstract": "The present study examined genetic, prenatal, and postnatal environmental pathways in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and depressive symptoms from parents to early adolescents (when these symptoms start to increase), while considering timing effects of exposure to parent anxiety and depressive symptoms postnatally. The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

        "title": "Male contraception: narrative review of ongoing research.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the release of the combined oral contraceptive pill in 1960, women have shouldered the burden of contraception and family planning. Over 60 years later, this is still the case as the only practical, effective contraceptive options available to men are condoms and vasectomy. However, there are now a variety of promising hormonal and non-hormonal male contraceptive options being studied. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide clinicians and laypeople with focused, up-to-date descriptions of novel strategies and targets for male contraception. We include a cautiously optimistic discussion of benefits and potential drawbacks, highlighting several methods in preclinical and clinical stages of development. RESULTS: As of June 2023, two hormonal male contraceptive methods are undergoing phase II clinical trials for safety and efficacy. A large-scale, international phase IIb trial investigating efficacy of transdermal segesterone acetate (Nestorone) plus testosterone gel has enrolled over 460 couples with completion estimated for late 2024. A second hormonal method, dimethandrolone undecanoate, is in two clinical trials focusing on safety, pharmacodynamics, suppression of spermatogenesis and hormones; the first of these two is estimated for completion in December 2024. There are also several non-hormonal methods with strong potential in preclinical stages of development. CONCLUSIONS: There exist several hurdles to novel male contraception. Therapeutic development takes decades of time, meticulous work, and financial investment, but with so many strong candidates it is our hope that there will soon be several safe, effective, and reversible contraceptive options available to male patients. R\u00e9SUM\u00e9: CONTEXTE: Depuis la sortie de la pilule contraceptive orale combin\u00e9e en 1960, les femmes ont assum\u00e9 le fardeau de la contraception et de la planification familiale. Plus de 60 ans plus tard, c\u2019est toujours le cas, car les seules options contraceptives pratiques et efficaces disponibles pour les hommes sont les pr\u00e9servatifs et la vasectomie. Cependant, il existe maintenant une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019options contraceptives masculines hormonales et non hormonales prometteuses qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude. Le but de cette revue narrative est de fournir aux cliniciens et aux profanes des descriptions cibl\u00e9es et \u00e0 jour de nouvelles strat\u00e9gies et cibles pour la contraception masculine. Nous incluons une discussion prudemment optimiste sur les avantages et les inconv\u00e9nients potentiels, en soulignant plusieurs m\u00e9thodes aux stades pr\u00e9cliniques et cliniques du d\u00e9veloppement. R\u00e9SULTATS: En juin 2023, deux m\u00e9thodes contraceptives masculines hormonales faisaient l\u2019objet d\u2019essais cliniques de phase II pour leur innocuit\u00e9 et leur efficacit\u00e9. Un essai international de phase IIb \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle, portant sur l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de l\u2019ac\u00e9tate de s\u00e9gest\u00e9rone transdermique (Nestorone) et du gel de testost\u00e9rone, a recrut\u00e9 plus de 460 couples et devrait \u00eatre achev\u00e9 pour la fin de 2024. Une seconde m\u00e9thode hormonale, l\u2019und\u00e9canoate de dim\u00e9thandrolone, fait l\u2019objet de deux essais cliniques ax\u00e9s sur l\u2019innocuit\u00e9, la pharmacodynamique, la suppression de la spermatogen\u00e8se et des hormones; le premier de ces deux essais devrait \u00eatre achev\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 2024. Il existe \u00e9galement plusieurs m\u00e9thodes non hormonales \u00e0 fort potentiel aux stades pr\u00e9cliniques de d\u00e9veloppement. CONCLUSIONS: Il existe plusieurs obstacles \u00e0 la nouvelle contraception masculine. Le d\u00e9veloppement th\u00e9rapeutique n\u00e9cessite des d\u00e9cennies de temps, un travail m\u00e9ticuleux et un investissement financier ; mais avec autant de candidats solides, nous esp\u00e9rons qu\u2019il y aura bient\u00f4t plusieurs options contraceptives s\u00fbres, efficaces et r\u00e9versibles, disponibles pour les hommes.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Male contraception with exogenously administered hormones suppresses both luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone leading to low intratesticular testosterone concentration. This results in reversible suppression of spermatogenesis and marked decrease in sperm output in the ejaculate and preventing pregnancy in the female partner. PRIOR STUDIES: Studies of testosterone administered alone or in combination of another gonadotropin suppressive agent such as a progestin or gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog showed decisively that the exogenous hormone administrations are effective in suppressing sperm output with few adverse events that are not anticipated. In contraceptive efficacy studies, testosterone alone or combined with a progestin are as effective in preventing pregnancies as female contraceptive methods. CONCLUSION: Hormone combinations for male contraception are in late-phase clinical trials and hold the promise of being the new, reversible contraception method for men in over half a century. Lessons learned from the male hormonal contraceptive development pave the way for new targeted approached to regulate male fertility.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition, occurring when an infectious agent invades the body, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2\u03bcg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin. Early detection of bacteria followed by antimicrobial susceptibility test can help by selection of appropriate antibiotic and prevent spread of infection.",

The aim of the study was to compare the metabolic profiles of plasma and urine samples collected at birth from preterm neonates with and without earlyonset sepsis (EOS) to identify metabolic perturbations that might orient the search for new early biomarkers. All preterm newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were eligible for this proof-of-concept, prospective case-control study. Infants were enrolled as \"cases\" if they developed EOS, and as \"controls\"if they did not. Plasma samples collected at birth and urine samples collected within 24 h of birth underwent untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis using mass spectrometry coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Of 123 eligible newborns, 15 developed EOS. These 15 newborns matched controls for gestational age and weight. Metabolomic analysis revealed evident clustering of the cases versus controls, with the glutathione and tryptophan metabolic pathways markedly disrupted in the former. In conclusion, neonates with EOS had a metabolic profile at birth that clearly distinguished them from those without sepsis, and metabolites of glutathione and tryptophan pathways are promising as new biomarkers of neonatal sepsis.",

The genetic overlap between ALS and other diseases is expanding and includes frontotemporal dementia, Paget's Disease of Bone, myopathy for adult cases, HSP and CMT for young cases highlighing the importance of retrieving the exhaustive familial history for each indivdual with ALS. Incomplete disease penetrance, diversity of the possible phenotypes, as well as the lack of confidence concerning the pathogenicity of most identified variants and/or possible oligogenic inheritance are burdens of ALS genetic counseling to be delivered to patients and at risk individuals.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library up to the 1st of January 2021. We included studies that assessed neonatal sepsis and the following outcomes; (1) change in the metabolism compared to healthy neonates and/or (2) metabolomics compared to traditional diagnostic tools of neonatal sepsis. The screened abstracts were independently considered for eligibility by two researchers. PROSPERO ID: CRD42020164454. RESULTS: The search identified in total 762 articles. Fifteen articles were assessed for eligibility. Four studies were included, with totally 78 neonates. The studies used different diagnostic criteria and had between 1 and 16 sepsis cases. All studies with bacterial sepsis found alterations in the glucose and lactate metabolism, reflecting possible redistribution of glucose consumption from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to the lactate and pentose phosphate pathway. We also found signs of increased oxidative stress and fatty acid oxidation in sepsis cases. CONCLUSION: We found signs of metabolomic signatures in neonatal sepsis. This may lead to better understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and detection of new candidate biomarkers. Results should be validated in large-scale multicentre studies.",

        "abstract": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated high rates of response in recurrent B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in children and young adults. Despite this success, a fraction of patients' experience relapse after treatment. Relapse is often preceded by recovery of healthy B cells, which suggests loss or dysfunction of CAR T-cells in bone marrow. This site is harder to access, and thus is not monitored as frequently as peripheral blood. Understanding the interplay between B cells, leukemic cells, and CAR T-cells in bone marrow is paramount in ascertaining the causes of lack of response. In this paper, we put forward a mathematical model representing the interaction between constantly renewing B cells, CAR T-cells, and leukemic cells in the bone marrow. Our model accounts for the maturation dynamics of B cells and incorporates effector and memory CAR T-cells. The model provides a plausible description of the dynamics of the various cellular compartments in bone marrow after CAR T infusion. After exploration of the parameter space, we found that the dynamics of CAR T product and disease were independent of the dose injected, initial B-cell load, and leukemia burden. We also show theoretically the importance of CAR T product attributes in determining therapy outcome, and have studied a variety of possible response scenarios, including second dosage schemes. We conclude by setting out ideas for the refinement of the model.",
