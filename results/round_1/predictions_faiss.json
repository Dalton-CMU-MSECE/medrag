Logistic regression and BKMR models were employed to evaluate the association between REEs and risk of MetS. RESULTS: Although REEs were not significantly associated with MetS, certain elements such as La, Pr, and Nd were negatively associated with abdominal obesity, whereas Ce, Pr, Nd, and Dy were positively associated with hypertension. BKMR models suggested a U-shaped relationship between mixed REEs and MetS, with varying effects on abdominal obesity and high blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that exposure to REEs may be associated with a reduced risk of abdominal obesity and an increased risk of high blood pressure.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Septic shock occurs when sepsis is related to severe hypotension and leads to a remarkable high number of deaths. The early diagnosis of septic shock is essential to reduce mortality. High-quality biomarkers can be objectively measured and evaluated as indicators to accurately predict disease diagnosis. However, single-gene prediction efficiency is inadequate; therefore, we identified a risk-score model based on gene signature to elevate predictive efficiency. METHODS: The gene expression profiles of GSE33118 and GSE26440 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. These two datasets were merged, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package in R software. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichments of DEGs were performed. Subsequently, Lasso regression and Boruta feature selection algorithm were combined to identify the hub genes of septic shock. GSE9692 was then subjected to weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify the septic shock-related gene modules. Subsequently, the genes within such modules that matched with septic shock-related DEGs were identified as the hub genes of septic shock. To further understand the function and signaling pathways of hub genes, we performed gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and then used the CIBERSORT tool to analyze the immune cell infiltration pattern of diseases. The diagnostic value of hub genes in septic shock was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and verified using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting in our hospital patients with septic shock. RESULTS: A total of 975 DEGs in the GSE33118 and GSE26440 databases were obtained, of which 30 DEGs were remarkably upregulated. With the use of Lasso regression and Boruta feature selection algorithm, six hub genes ( CONCLUSIONS: ",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sleeping sickness, or human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), is transmitted by tsetse flies in endemic foci in sub-Saharan Africa. Because of international travel and population movements, cases are also occasionally diagnosed in non-endemic countries. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Antitrypanosomal medicines to treat the disease are available gratis through the World Health Organization (WHO) thanks to a public-private partnership, and exclusive distribution of the majority of them enables WHO to gather information on all exported cases. Data collected by WHO are complemented by case reports and scientific publications. During 2011-2020, 49 cases of HAT were diagnosed in 16 non-endemic countries across five continents: 35 cases were caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, mainly in tourists visiting wildlife areas in eastern and southern Africa, and 14 cases were due to T. b. gambiense, mainly in African migrants originating from or visiting endemic areas in western and central Africa. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: HAT diagnosis in non-endemic countries is rare and can be challenging, but alertness and surveillance must be maintained to contribute to WHO's elimination goals.

        "title": "The Emerging Role and Clinical Applications of Morphomics in Diagnostic Imaging.",
        "abstract": "Analytic morphomics refers to the accurate measurement of specific biological markers of human body composition in diagnostic medical imaging. The increasing prevalence of disease processes that alter body composition including obesity, cachexia, and sarcopenia has generated interest in specific targeted measurement of these metrics to possibly prevent or reduce negative health outcomes. Typical morphomic measurements include the area and density of muscle, bone, vascular calcification, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat on a specific validated axial level in the patient's cross-sectional diagnostic imaging. A distinct advantage of these measurements is that they can be made retrospectively and opportunistically with pre-existing datasets. We provide a narrative review of the current state of art in morphomics, but also consider some potential future directions for this exciting field. Imaging based quantitative assessment of body composition has enormous potential across the breadth and scope of modern clinical practice. From risk stratification to treatment planning, and outcome assessment, all can be enhanced with the use of analytic morphomics. Moreover, it is likely that many new opportunities for personalized medicine will emerge as the field evolves. As radiologists, embracing analytic morphomics will enable us to contribute added value in the care of every patient.",

Symptoms range from dryness to severe extra-glandular disease involving manifestations in the skin, lungs, nervous system, and kidney. Fatigue occurs in 70% of patients, characterizing primary SS (pSS) and significantly impacting the patient's quality of life. There are some generic and specific instruments used to measure fatigue in SS. The mechanisms involved with fatigue in SS are still poorly understood, but it appears fatigue signaling pathways are more associated with cell protection and defense than with pro-inflammatory pathways. There are no established pharmacological treatment options for fatigue in pSS. So far, exercise and neuromodulation techniques have shown positive effects on fatigue in pSS. This study briefly reviews fatigue in pSS, with special attention to outcome measures, biomarkers, and possible treatment options.",

We aimed to profile the expression signature of three inflammation-related lncRNAs, MALAT1, ANRIL, and HHOTAIR, in the plasma of neonates with sepsis and correlate these signatures with the phenotype. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This case-control study included 124 neonates with sepsis (88 survivors/36 non-survivors) admitted to the neonatal ICU and 17 healthy neonates. The relative expressions were quantified by real-time PCR and correlated to the clinic-laboratory data. RESULTS: The three circulating lncRNAs were upregulated in the cases; the median levels were MALAT1 (median = 1.71, IQR: -0.5 to 3.27), ANRIL (median = 1.09, IQR: 0.89 to 1.30), and HOTAIR (median = 1.83, IQR: 1.44 to 2.41). Co-expression analysis showed that the three studied lncRNAs were directly correlated (all  CONCLUSION: Circulatory MALAT1, ANRIL, and HOTAIR were upregulated in neonatal sepsis, and the latter two may have the potential as prognostic biomarkers for survival in neonatal sepsis.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine men's satisfaction with and acceptability of a once-daily, oral regimen of dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU) versus placebo when used for 28\u00a0days. STUDY DESIGN: After a Phase I double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating trial of oral DMAU for 28-days, 57 healthy male volunteers completed a survey assessing their experience and satisfaction with the regimen. In the trial, participants were randomized to receive up to 4 DMAU capsules daily versus placebo and instructed to ingest them within 30\u00a0min of consuming a high fat meal. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were performed, followed by a 6-week recovery phase. Participants were counseled that they could not rely on the drug for contraception. RESULTS: Fifty-seven participants were offered acceptability surveys (39 DMAU, 18 placebo). Most respondents, 80% (45/56), reported satisfaction with the method; 77% (44/57) would recommend it. 54% (31/57), reported that, if available, they would use the method as their primary contraceptive. More respondents reported satisfaction with active DMAU than placebo (87% vs. 67%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Most respondents, 91% (52/57), reported no difficulty with having to take up to 4 pills within 30\u00a0min of ingesting a high-fat meal. CONCLUSION: Most participants reported that the study method, daily oral DMAU or placebo, was satisfactory and acceptable. Having to take the drug after a high-fat meal did not detract from acceptability. IMPLICATIONS: Most participants in a 4-week trial of daily DMAU capsules would recommend and use the method. High satisfaction among DMAU and placebo groups affirms acceptability of a daily male contraceptive pill, warranting further study of oral DMAU.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Determination of the characteristics of paediatric invasive bacterial infections (IBI) is essential for early identification of children requiring immediate antibiotic therapy. The main objective is to characterize the emergency presentation of the IBI among children aged younger than 14 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective registry-based cohort study including all patients aged younger than 14 years diagnosed with confirmed IBI (culture or genomic detection using the polymerase chain reaction) was carried out in a paediatric emergency department between 2008 and 2015. Severity criteria were as follows: death, sequelae or admission to the ICU. RESULTS: Of the 223 IBIs reported, 187 (83.9%) corresponded to previously healthy patients (median age=19 months) and 165 (74%) were well appearing. The most common diagnoses were occult bacteraemia [60 (26.9%)] and sepsis [56 (25.1%)]. The most frequent pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae [68 (30.5%)] and Neisseria meningitidis [42 (18.8%)]. Four (1.8) patients died (S. pneumoniae, 2) and eight (3.5%) had sequelae (S. pneumoniae, 5). The diagnoses and clinical characteristics of the children varied significantly depending on the isolated pathogen. Duration of fever less than 24\u2009h, symptoms other than fever and not being well-appearing upon arrival to the emergency department were independent risk factors for greater severity (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve=0.805; 95% confidence interval: 0.741-0.868). CONCLUSION: IBIs are commonly diagnosed in previously healthy and well-appearing young children. S. pneumoniae was responsible for the majority of deaths or sequelae. Short duration of fever, symptoms other than fever and not being stable on arrival are associated with greater severity.",

This has led to the emergence of  OBJECTIVE: This paper analyzes the role and functions of a neuropsychologist in primary schools and the possibilities of his/her collaboration with other specialists in diagnosing children's problems and organizing remediation for problematic kids. DESIGN: We established four steps for launching neuropsychological work at primary schools: 1) setting up a screening group for neuropsychological assessment of all children entering the first year of school; 2) a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of the children who showed poor results in the first step of the study; 3)ateam remediation program; and 4) evaluation of the remediation results by a new neuropsychological assessment at the end of the remediation program. RESULTS: The results of the first step of our study showed a very high percentage of children with cognitive problems- 37% of 202 6-8 year-old schoolchildren entering the first year of school. They formed a group at risk for future learning disabilities and maladjustment at school. Age and gender differences, and the structure of cognitive underdevelopment, were discussed in the second step of our study. In the third step, a team of school specialists, including a neuropsychologist, a teacher, a school psychologist, and a school social worker, implemented a remediation program which was created and supervised by a neuropsychologist. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of the pupils revealed a complex structure of cognitive disturbances which interfere with pupils' learning abilities in primary school. The team approach can efficiently prevent learning disabilities and help children with cognitive underdevelopment and risks of future unsuccess at school, when this collaboration of school specialists has a common theoretical approach and is based upon comprehensive neuropsychological assessment.",

        "abstract": "The potential health effects of exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) remain largely unexplored. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

Meanwhile, unfortunately, the specific biomarkers for the early and timely diagnosis of sepsis in infants and for the determination of the severity of this disease are lacking in clinical practice. METHODS: Samples from 18 sepsis infants with comorbidities, 25 sepsis infants without comorbidities, and 25 infants with noninfectious diseases were evaluated using a serum metabolomics approach based on liquid chromatography\u2012mass spectrometry (LC\u2012MS) technology. Differentially abundant metabolites were screened via multivariate statistical analysis. In addition, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) analyses were conducted to identify the key metabolites in infants with sepsis and without infections. The random forest algorithm was applied to determine key differentially abundant metabolites between sepsis infants with and without comorbidities. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for biomarker value testing. Finally, a metabolic pathway analysis was conducted to explore the metabolic and signaling pathways associated with the identified differentially abundant metabolites. RESULTS: A total of 189 metabolites exhibited significant differences between infectious infants and noninfectious infants, while 137 distinct metabolites exhibited differences between septic infants with and without comorbidities. After screening for the key differentially abundant metabolites using LASSO and SVM-RFE analyses, hexylamine, psychosine sulfate, LysoPC (18:1 (9Z)/0:0), 2,4,6-tribromophenol, and 25-cinnamoyl-vulgaroside were retained for the diagnosis of infant sepsis. ROC curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.9200 for hexylamine, 0.9749 for psychosine sulfate, 0.9684 for LysoPC (18:1 (9Z)/0:0), 0.7405 for 2,4,6-tribromophenol, 0.8893 for 25-cinnamoyl-vulgaroside, and 1.000 for the combination of all metabolites. When the septic infants with comorbidities were compared to those without comorbidities, four endogenous metabolites with the greatest importance were identified using the random forest algorithm, namely, 12-oxo-20-trihydroxy-leukotriene B4, dihydrovaltrate, PA (8:0/12:0), and 2-heptanethiol. The ROC curve analysis of these four key differentially abundant metabolites revealed that the AUC was 1 for all four metabolites. Pathway analysis indicated that phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and porphyrin metabolism play important roles in infant sepsis. CONCLUSION: Serum metabolite profiles were identified, and machine learning was applied to identify the key differentially abundant metabolites in septic infants with comorbidities, septic infants without comorbidities, and infants without infectious diseases. The findings obtained are expected to facilitate the early diagnosis of sepsis in infants and determine the severity of the disease.",

        "title": "Altruistic Donation of Surplus Embryos to Known and Unknown Recipients, The Dutch Approach.",
        "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that embryo donation can be a successful treatment for infertile couples,<br />however the willingness of Dutch couples to donate or accept embryos was unknown. The aim of this article is to<br />describe the protocol and results for altruistic embryo donation of the only embryo bank in the Netherlands.<br />Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive study. Since 2011, donated cryo-embryos from couples that have undergone<br />in vitro-fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) treatments, are being stored in our embryo<br />bank. The majority of the donated embryos were frozen on day 3 or 4 by slow freezing techniques. We perform a<br />thorough medical and psychological screening of donor couples and recipients, according to the protocol drawn up in<br />close collaboration with the Dutch Ministry of Health.<br />Results: Up to June 2021, 54 women have received embryos from our embryo bank, all single embryo transfers.<br />While the clinical pregnancy rate in 'unknown' embryo donations was relatively high (25.3%), the live birth rate<br />shows limited success (12.6%), partly due to high pregnancy loss through miscarriage. In known donation procedures,<br />the recipients tend to undergo more procedures, depending on the number of donated cryo-embryos. Twentyeight<br />women received embryos from known donors, with a clinical pregnancy rate per embryo transfer of 24%, and<br />live birth rate of 14%. In total, 82 recipients were granted donated cryo-embryos, twenty had an ongoing pregnancy<br />(24.4%), nineteen of whom have given birth to a healthy child (23%).<br />Conclusion: Altruistic embryo donation of embryos appears to be satisfying for the donors, as they are not obliged to destroy<br />their embryos, but instead help others build a family. Although success rates are still limited, partly due to the relatively high<br />miscarriage rates and inferior freezing techniques, to this date nineteen out of 82 recipients have given birth to a healthy child.",

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) is a relatively new treatment for pediatric leukemia and has been the focus of recent advancements. CAR is manufactured to express T cells through various ways such as using retroviruses, transposons and transposase, electroporation, and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Together, it provides flexibility since it recognizes proteins without the need of antigen processing and presentation, can recognize carbohydrates and lipids, and it has been proven to be cost-effective. Despite these benefits however, problems faced by this therapy include unrecognized tumor proteins possibly escaping the system, CAR T cell expression being transient, and the therapy being one of the most expensive cancer drug ever approved. As a result, recent progress has been ongoing where researchers have combined CAR-T cells with natural killer (NK) cells and different cytokines to maximize its efficacy and potency while limiting potential risks such as cytokine release syndrome. Consequently, these cells gained the ability to be universal-being able to be used to treat multiple patients, maintain viability for a longer period, and prevent relapse.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Trofinetide was recently approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome (RTT) on the basis of the efficacy and safety findings of the phase\u00a03 LAVENDER study, which used a body weight-based dosing regimen. Exposure-response (E-R) efficacy modeling was used to characterize relationships between trofinetide exposure measures (maximum drug concentration and area under the concentration-time curve for the dosing interval of 0-12\u00a0h [AUC METHODS: Efficacy endpoints were modeled using trofinetide exposure measures predicted from the population pharmacokinetic model and Bayesian estimates. The analysis population for each E-R model comprised individuals receiving placebo or trofinetide who had available trofinetide exposure measures. Efficacy endpoints were scores from the Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire (RSBQ), the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement, the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile\u2122 Infant-Toddler Checklist (CSBS-DP-IT) Social Composite, and the Rett Syndrome Clinician Rating of Ability to Communicate Choices (RTT-COMC). RESULTS: Higher trofinetide exposure was associated with improvements in RSBQ, CSBS-DP-IT Social Composite, and RTT-COMC scores. Assuming target trofinetide AUC CONCLUSION: E-R efficacy modeling demonstrated significant relationships between trofinetide exposure and RSBQ, CSBS-DP-IT Social Composite, and RTT-COMC scores. Trofinetide is efficacious within the target exposure range, supporting the approved dosing regimen for trofinetide. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01703533, NCT02715115, NCT04181723. Trofinetide is the first approved treatment for people living with Rett syndrome, a rare genetic condition affecting brain development. This approval was based on the findings of clinical studies in which trofinetide showed significant improvements in the symptoms of Rett syndrome. In this study researchers were looking to see if the level of trofinetide in the blood was related to the level of improvement in symptoms observed in clinical studies. Information on the effectiveness of trofinetide was obtained from the phase\u00a03 LAVENDER study which used doses of trofinetide according to body weight. Trofinetide\u2019s effectiveness was assessed on the basis of clinical measurements of key Rett syndrome symptoms. All the information on trofinetide dose, blood levels, and how much symptoms changed (i.e., effectiveness of trofinetide) was then used to develop models to predict symptom responses in the observed population. Researchers found that as the blood levels of trofinetide increased the symptom improvement also increased. When the blood levels were at the recommended level that was achieved in the LAVENDER study, the model predicted that symptom improvement was up to seven times greater with trofinetide than having no treatment (i.e., placebo). This study shows a positive relationship between trofinetide blood levels and improvement in the symptoms of Rett syndrome. Trofinetide was effective within the recommended blood level range in the LAVENDER study using the approved weight-based dosing.",

Conventional MPS, caused by inborn deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes involved in GAG degradation, display various multisystemic symptoms-including progressive neurological complications, ophthalmological disorders, hearing loss, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary issues, cardiorespiratory problems, bone and joint abnormalities, dwarfism, and coarse facial features. Mucopolysaccharidosis-Plus Syndrome (MPSPS), an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the endo-lysosomal tethering protein VPS33A, shows additional renal and hematopoietic abnormalities (\"Plus symptoms\") uncommon in conventional MPS. Here, we analyze data from biochemical, histological, and physical examinations-particularly of blood counts and kidney function-to further characterize the clinical phenotype of MPSPS. A series of blood tests indicate hematopoietic symptoms including progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia, which correlate with histological observations of hypoplastic bone marrow. High urinary excretion of protein (caused by impairments in renal filtration), hypoalbuminemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, cholesterol, and uric acid indicate renal dysfunction. Histological analyses of MPSPS kidneys similarly suggest the extensive destruction of glomerular structures by foamy podocytes.

        "title": "Digitally augmented, parent-led CBT versus treatment as usual for child anxiety problems in child mental health services in England and Northern Ireland: a pragmatic, non-inferiority, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety problems are common in children, yet few affected children access evidence-based treatment. Digitally augmented psychological therapies bring potential to increase availability of effective help for children with mental health problems. This study aimed to establish whether therapist-supported, digitally augmented, parent-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could increase the efficiency of treatment without compromising clinical effectiveness and acceptability. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, unblinded, two-arm, multisite, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapist-supported, parent-led CBT using the Online Support and Intervention (OSI) for child anxiety platform compared with treatment as usual for child (aged 5-12 years) anxiety problems in 34 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in England and Northern Ireland. We examined acceptability of OSI plus therapist support via qualitative interviews. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OSI plus therapist support or treatment as usual, minimised by child age, gender, service type, and baseline child anxiety interference. Outcomes were assessed at week 14 and week 26 after randomisation. The primary clinical outcome was parent-reported interference caused by child anxiety at week 26 assessment, using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale-parent report (CAIS-P). The primary measure of health economic effect was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Outcome analyses were conducted blind in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with a standardised non-inferiority margin of 0\u00b733 for clinical analyses. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, 12890382. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2020, and Aug 3, 2022, 706 families (706 children and their parents or carers) were referred to the study information. 444 families were enrolled. Parents reported 255 (58%) child participants' gender to be female, 184 (41%) male, three (<1%) other, and one (<1%) preferred not to report their child's gender. 400 (90%) children were White and the mean age was 9\u00b720 years (SD 1\u00b779). 85% of families for whom clinicians provided information in the treatment as usual group received CBT. OSI plus therapist support was non-inferior for parent-reported anxiety interference on the CAIS-P (SMD 0\u00b701, 95% CI -0\u00b715 to 0\u00b717; p<0\u00b70001) and all secondary outcomes. The mean difference in QALYs across trial arms approximated to zero, and OSI plus therapist support was associated with lower costs than treatment as usual. OSI plus therapist support was likely to be cost effective under certain scenarios, but uncertainty was high. OSI plus therapist support acceptability was good. No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Digitally augmented intervention brought promising savings without compromising outcomes and as such presents a valuable tool for increasing access to psychological therapies and meeting the demand for treatment of child anxiety problems.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiological characteristics of pediatric sepsis in Southwest China PICUs. DESIGN: A prospective, multicenter, and observational study. SETTING: Twelve PICUs in Southwest China. PATIENTS: The patients admitted to the PICU from April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023. The age ranged from 28 days to 18 years. All patients met the criteria of severe sepsis or septic shock. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 31 PICUs invited to participate, 12 PICUs (capacity of 292 beds) enrolled patients in the study. During the study period, 11,238 children were admitted to the participating PICUs, 367 (3.3%) of whom met the diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock. The most prevalent sites of infection were the respiratory system (55%) and the digestive system (15%). The primary treatments administered to these patients included antibiotics (100%), albumin (61.3%), invasive mechanical ventilation (58.7%), glucocorticoids (55.6%), blood products (51%), gammaglobulin (51%), and vasoactive medications (46.6%). Sepsis-related mortality in the PICU was 11.2% (41/367). Nearly half of the sepsis deaths occurred within the first 3 days of PICU admission (22/41, 53.7%). The mortality rate of septic shock (32/167, 19.2%) was significantly higher than that of severe sepsis (9/200, 4.5%; p < 0.001). The outcomes of a multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that a higher pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and the use of invasive mechanical ventilation and vasoactive medications were independently associated with PICU mortality in children with sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: This report updates the epidemiological data of pediatric sepsis in PICUs in Southwest China. Sepsis is still a life-threatening disease in children.",

        "title": "Early detection of late-onset neonatal sepsis from noninvasive biosignals using deep learning: A multicenter prospective development and validation study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its accurate and timely diagnosis is hindered by vague symptoms and the urgent necessity for early antibiotic intervention. The gold standard for diagnosing the condition is the identification of a pathogenic organism from normally sterile sites via laboratory testing. However, this method is resource-intensive and cannot be conducted continuously. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to predict the onset of late-onset sepsis (LOS) with good diagnostic value as early as possible using non-invasive biosignal measurements from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) monitors. METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study, we developed a multimodal machine learning algorithm based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure that uses the power spectral density (PSD) of recorded biosignals to predict the onset of LOS. This approach aimed to discern LOS-related pathogenic spectral signatures without labor-intensive manual artifact removal. RESULTS: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic score of 0.810 (95\u00a0% CI 0.698-0.922) on the validation dataset. With an optimal operating point, LOS detection had 83\u00a0% sensitivity and 73\u00a0% specificity. The median early detection was 44\u00a0h before clinical suspicion. The results highlighted the additive importance of electrocardiogram and respiratory impedance (RESP) signals in improving predictive accuracy. According to a more detailed analysis, the predictive power arose from the morphology of the electrocardiogram's R-wave and sudden changes in the RESP signal. CONCLUSION: Raw biosignals from NICU monitors, in conjunction with PSD transformation, as input to the CNN, can provide state-of-the-art prediction performance for LOS without the need for artifact removal. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to highlight the independent and additive predictive potential of electrocardiogram R-wave morphology and concurrent, sudden changes in the RESP waveform in predicting the onset of LOS using non-invasive biosignals.",

Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutations are found in about 2% of all patients. Tofersen is a novel oligonucleotide antisense drug specifically developed to treat SOD1-ALS patients. AREAS COVERED: Our review covers and discusses tofersen pharmacological properties and its phase I/II and III clinical trials results. Other available drugs and their limitations are also addressed. EXPERT OPINION: VALOR study failed to meet the primary endpoint (change in the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale score from baseline to week 28, tofersen arm vs. placebo), but a significant reduction in plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels was observed in tofersen arm (60% vs. 20%). PrefALS study has proposed plasma NfL has a potential biomarker for presymptomatic treatment, since it increases 6-12\u2009months before phenoconversion. There is probably a delay between plasma NfL reduction and the clinical benefit.

Here, we deployed a novel task in which subjects interact with four unknown virtual partners in a turn-taking paradigm akin to a dance, and report on their experience with each. The virtual partners embody four combinations of low/high expressivity of positive/negative mood. Higher scores on our symptomatic measures of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were all linked to a general negative appraisal of all the interpersonal experiences. Moreover, the negative appraisal of the partner who displayed a high negative/low positive mood was tied with attachment anxiety and BPD symptoms. The extent to which subjects felt responsible for causing partners' distress was most strongly linked to attachment anxiety. Finally, we provide a fully-fledged exploration of move-by-move action latencies and click distances from partners. This analysis underscored slower movement initiation from anxiously attached individuals throughout all virtual interactions. In summary, we describe a novel paradigm for second-person neuroscience, which allowed both the replication of established results and the capture of new behavioural signatures associated with attachment anxiety, and discuss its limitations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as potential molecular biomarkers for sepsis. We aimed to profile the expression signature of three inflammation-related lncRNAs, MALAT1, ANRIL, and HHOTAIR, in the plasma of neonates with sepsis and correlate these signatures with the phenotype. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This case-control study included 124 neonates with sepsis (88 survivors/36 non-survivors) admitted to the neonatal ICU and 17 healthy neonates. The relative expressions were quantified by real-time PCR and correlated to the clinic-laboratory data. RESULTS: The three circulating lncRNAs were upregulated in the cases; the median levels were MALAT1 (median = 1.71, IQR: -0.5 to 3.27), ANRIL (median = 1.09, IQR: 0.89 to 1.30), and HOTAIR (median = 1.83, IQR: 1.44 to 2.41).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects adults, characterized by muscle weakness resulting from the specific death of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. The pathogenesis of ALS is associated with the accumulation of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) proteins and neurofilaments in motor neurons, highlighting the critical need for disease-modifying treatments. Current therapies, such as riluzole and edaravone, provide only symptomatic relief. Recently, tofersen gained approval from the US FDA under the brand name Qalsody as the first and only gene therapy for ALS, addressing a significant pathological aspect of the disease. METHODS: We carried out a literature survey using PubMed, Scopus, National Institutes of Health, and Biogen for articles published in the English language concerned with \"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\", pathophysiology, current treatment, treatment under clinical trial, and the newly approved drug \"tofersen\" and its detailed summary. RESULTS: A comprehensive review of the literature on the pathophysiology, available treatment, and newly approved drug for this condition revealed convincing evidence that we are now able to better monitor and treat ALS. CONCLUSIONS: Although treatment of ALS is difficult, the newly approved drug tofersen has emerged as a potential therapy to slow down the progression of ALS by targeting SOD1 mRNA, representing a significant advancement in the treatment of ALS.",

        "title": "The pyrethroids metabolite 3-phenoxybenzoic acid induces dopaminergic degeneration.",
        "abstract": "Exposure to pyrethroids, a significant class of the most widely used agricultural chemicals, has been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, although many different pyrethroids induce roughly the same symptoms of Parkinsonism, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To find the shared key features among these mechanisms, we focused on 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common and prominent metabolite of most pyrethroids produced via hydrolysis by CEs in mammals. To determine the contribution of 3-PBA to the initiation and progression of PD, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively, and found that 3-PBA not only accumulates in murine brain tissues over time but also further induces PD-like pathologies (increased \u03b1-syn and phospho-S129, decreased TH) to the same or even greater extent than the precursor pyrethroid. A before-after study of PET-DAT in the same mice revealed that low concentrations of 3-PBA (0.5 mg/kg) could paradoxically cause DAT to increase (22.46% higher than pre-drug test). The intervention of DAT inhibitors and activators respectively alleviated and enhanced the dopaminergic toxicity of 3-PBA, indicating that 3-PBA interacts with DAT. In particular, low concentrations of 3-PBA increase the DAT, which in turn induces 3-PBA to enter the dopaminergic neurons to exert toxic effects. Finally, we described a mechanism underlying this potential role of 3-PBA in the pathological aggregation of \u03b1-syn. Specifically, 3-PBA was found to dysregulate C/EBP \u03b2 levels and further anomalously activate AEP in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by increased accumulation of pathologically cleaved \u03b1-syn (N103 fragments) and accelerated \u03b1-syn aggregation. All these results suggest that 3-PBA exposure could mimic the pathological and pathogenetic features of PD, showing that this metabolite is a key pathogenic compound in pyrethroid-related pathological effects and a possible dopamine neurotoxin. Additionally, our findings provide a crucial reference for the primary prevention of PD.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pyroptosis is closely relevant to sepsis. However, the molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis in pneumonia-induced sepsis are still not fully understood. Thus, this study aimed to find the specific molecular pathways associated with pyroptosis and explore their relationship in pneumonia-induced sepsis. METHODS: First, significant signaling pathways related to pneumonia-induced sepsis were screened by bioinformatics analysis based on GSE48080. The peripheral blood samples from patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis and healthy subjects were collected. Pneumonia-induced sepsis rat models were also established. Then, inflammatory response, pyroptosis, and regulatory T cells (Tregs)/T-helper 17 (Th17), Th1/Th2, and M1/M2 cell ratios in pneumonia-induced sepsis were evaluated. RESULTS: IL-17 signaling pathway was significantly related to pneumonia-induced sepsis by bioinformatics analysis. Compared with healthy groups, the higher of Th17/Treg, Th1/Th2 and M1/M2 cell radios in the patients and sepsis rat model indicated that pneumonia-induced sepsis caused a severe inflammatory response. This result was confirmed by higher levels of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18) and an inflammation indicator (LDH), as well as pyroptosis occurrence in sepsis. Additionally, the up-regulation of key molecules (HMGB1, RAGE, IL-17A, TRAF6 and NK-\u03baB) in the IL-17 signaling pathway suggested the IL-17 pathway was activated. Moreover, the release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and the levels of the molecules (NLRP3, NLRC4, Cleaved caspase-1, and Cleaved GSDMD) associated with caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis were up-regulated in pneumonia-induced sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: As NK-\u03baB activation can promote the development of caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis, these findings suggested that the activation of the IL-17 signaling pathway could promote pyroptosis in pneumonia-induced sepsis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety problems are common in children, yet few affected children access evidence-based treatment. Digitally augmented psychological therapies bring potential to increase availability of effective help for children with mental health problems. This study aimed to establish whether therapist-supported, digitally augmented, parent-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could increase the efficiency of treatment without compromising clinical effectiveness and acceptability. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, unblinded, two-arm, multisite, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapist-supported, parent-led CBT using the Online Support and Intervention (OSI) for child anxiety platform compared with treatment as usual for child (aged 5-12 years) anxiety problems in 34 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in England and Northern Ireland. We examined acceptability of OSI plus therapist support via qualitative interviews. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OSI plus therapist support or treatment as usual, minimised by child age, gender, service type, and baseline child anxiety interference. Outcomes were assessed at week 14 and week 26 after randomisation. The primary clinical outcome was parent-reported interference caused by child anxiety at week 26 assessment, using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale-parent report (CAIS-P). The primary measure of health economic effect was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Outcome analyses were conducted blind in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with a standardised non-inferiority margin of 0\u00b733 for clinical analyses. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, 12890382. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2020, and Aug 3, 2022, 706 families (706 children and their parents or carers) were referred to the study information. 444 families were enrolled. Parents reported 255 (58%) child participants' gender to be female, 184 (41%) male, three (<1%) other, and one (<1%) preferred not to report their child's gender. 400 (90%) children were White and the mean age was 9\u00b720 years (SD 1\u00b779). 85% of families for whom clinicians provided information in the treatment as usual group received CBT. OSI plus therapist support was non-inferior for parent-reported anxiety interference on the CAIS-P (SMD 0\u00b701, 95% CI -0\u00b715 to 0\u00b717; p<0\u00b70001) and all secondary outcomes. The mean difference in QALYs across trial arms approximated to zero, and OSI plus therapist support was associated with lower costs than treatment as usual. OSI plus therapist support was likely to be cost effective under certain scenarios, but uncertainty was high. OSI plus therapist support acceptability was good. No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Digitally augmented intervention brought promising savings without compromising outcomes and as such presents a valuable tool for increasing access to psychological therapies and meeting the demand for treatment of child anxiety problems.

Through a systematic search we identified 54 studies comprising 2066 participants that were treated with a range of cell therapy interventions. We categorized the reported 53 unique outcome instruments and additional descriptive measures into 10 categories and 12 sub-categories. Movement and Posture was the most frequently reported outcome category, followed by Safety, however Quality of Life, and various prevalent comorbidities and complications of CP were infrequently reported.

PRIOR STUDIES: Studies of testosterone administered alone or in combination of another gonadotropin suppressive agent such as a progestin or gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog showed decisively that the exogenous hormone administrations are effective in suppressing sperm output with few adverse events that are not anticipated. In contraceptive efficacy studies, testosterone alone or combined with a progestin are as effective in preventing pregnancies as female contraceptive methods.

        "title": "Clinical Implementation and Evaluation of Three Implementation Interventions for a Family-Oriented Care for Children of Mentally Ill Parents (ci-chimps): Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Multicenter Trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Germany, approximately three million children under the age of eighteen have a mentally ill parent. These children are at an increased risk of developing a mental illness themselves (1) as well as a physical illness (2). While research has identified numerous evidence-based family-oriented interventions, little is known about how to implement such interventions effectively and efficiently in clinical practice in Germany. This implementation study (ci-chimps) evaluates three clinical implementation projects with three different implementation interventions for the optimal implementation of the tailored family-oriented preventive and therapeutic interventions in the CHIMPS-NET (children of mentally ill parents-research network) with an implementation model for children of mentally ill parents. METHODS: A two-group randomized controlled multicenter trial will examine changes in family-oriented practice and aspects of implementation at baseline as well as at 12- and 24-months follow-up. The CHIMPS-Network consists of 20 clinical centers. The centers in the intervention group receive the support of all of the three implementation interventions: (1) optimal pathways to care, (2) education and a training program for professionals, and (3) systematic screening for children. The centers in the control group do not receive this specific implementation support. DISCUSSION: While we know that children of mentally ill parents are an important target group to be addressed by preventive and therapeutic interventions, there is often a lack of structured implementation of family-oriented interventions in clinical practice in Germany. Using a randomized controlled multicenter trial design with a large and wide-ranging sample (clinics for adult psychiatry and clinics for child and adolescent psychiatry, university clinics and clinics at the real health care) will provide a robust understanding of implementing family-oriented changes in German clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The CHIMPS-NET-study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register on 2019-12-19 (DRKS00020380) and with Clinical Trials on 2020-4-30 (NCT04369625), the ci-chimps-study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00026217) on 2021-08-27, the Clinical Trials registration is in review process.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Widespread adoption of rapid genomic testing in pediatric critical care requires robust clinical and laboratory pathways that provide equitable and consistent service across health care systems. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the performance of a multicenter network for ultra-rapid genomic diagnosis in a public health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Descriptive feasibility study of critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions treated at 12 Australian hospitals between March 2018 and February 2019, with data collected to May 2019. A formal implementation strategy emphasizing communication and feedback, standardized processes, coordination, distributed leadership, and collective learning was used to facilitate adoption. EXPOSURES: Ultra-rapid exome sequencing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report. The secondary outcomes were the molecular diagnostic yield, the change in clinical management after the ultra-rapid exome sequencing report, the time from hospital admission to the laboratory report, and the proportion of laboratory reports returned prior to death or hospital discharge. RESULTS: The study population included 108 patients with a median age of 28 days (range, 0 days to 17 years); 34% were female; and 57% were from neonatal intensive care units, 33% were from pediatric intensive care units, and 9% were from other hospital wards. The mean time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 3.3 days (95% CI, 3.2-3.5 days) and the median time was 3 days (range, 2-7 days). The mean time from hospital admission to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 17.5 days (95% CI, 14.6-21.1 days) and 93 reports (86%) were issued prior to death or hospital discharge. A molecular diagnosis was established in 55 patients (51%). Eleven diagnoses (20%) resulted from using the following approaches to augment standard exome sequencing analysis: mitochondrial genome sequencing analysis, exome sequencing-based copy number analysis, use of international databases to identify novel gene-disease associations, and additional phenotyping and RNA analysis. In 42 of 55 patients (76%) with a molecular diagnosis and 6 of 53 patients (11%) without a molecular diagnosis, the ultra-rapid exome sequencing result was considered as having influenced clinical management. Targeted treatments were initiated in 12 patients (11%), treatment was redirected toward palliative care in 14 patients (13%), and surveillance for specific complications was initiated in 19 patients (18%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests feasibility of ultra-rapid genomic testing in critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions in the Australian public health care system. However, further research is needed to understand the clinical value of such testing, and the generalizability of the findings to other health care settings.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide expression profiles have been previously employed as clinical research diagnostic tools for newborn sepsis. We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

        "abstract": "The first days of postnatal life are energetically demanding as metabolic functions change dramatically to accommodate drastic environmental and physiologic transitions after birth. It is increasingly appreciated that metabolic pathways are not only crucial for nutrition but also play important roles in regulating inflammation and the host response to infection. Neonatal susceptibility to infection is increased due to a functionally distinct immune response characterized by high reliance on innate immune mechanisms. Interactions between metabolism and the immune response are increasingly recognized, as changes in metabolic pathways drive innate immune cell function and activation and consequently host response to pathogens. Moreover, metabolites, such as acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and succinate have immunoregulatory properties and serve as cofactors for enzymes involved in epigenetic reprogramming or \"training\" of innate immune cells after an initial infectious exposure. Highly sensitive metabolomic approaches allow us to define alterations in metabolic signatures as they change during ontogeny and as perturbed by immunization or infection, thereby linking metabolic pathways to immune cell effector functions. Characterizing the ontogeny of immunometabolism will offer new opportunities to prevent, diagnose, and treat neonatal sepsis.",

        "abstract": "Dependency on digital devices resulting in an ever-increasing daily screen time has subsequently also been the cause of several adverse effects on physical and mental or psychological health. Constant exposure to devices like smartphones, personal computers, and television can severely affect mental health- increase stress and anxiety, for example, and cause various sleep issues in both children as well as adults. Risk factors for obesity and cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, poor regulation of stress, low HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance are among the physical health repercussions we see. The psychological health effects comprise suicidal tendencies and symptoms of depression which are associated with digital device dependency, screen-time-induced poor sleep quality, and content-influenced negativity. Oftentimes it can cause the induction of a state of hyper-arousal, increase stress hormones, desynchronize the body clock or the circadian cycle, alter brain chemistry and create a drag on mental energy and development. With a focus on brain development in children and detrimental effects in both adults and children, this research article goes on to explore the various aspects of screen addiction and excessive screen exposure.",

Data collected by WHO are complemented by case reports and scientific publications. During 2011-2020, 49 cases of HAT were diagnosed in 16 non-endemic countries across five continents: 35 cases were caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, mainly in tourists visiting wildlife areas in eastern and southern Africa, and 14 cases were due to T. b. gambiense, mainly in African migrants originating from or visiting endemic areas in western and central Africa. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: HAT diagnosis in non-endemic countries is rare and can be challenging, but alertness and surveillance must be maintained to contribute to WHO's elimination goals. Early detection is particularly important as it considerably improves the prognosis.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Previous studies applying Sepsis-3 criteria to children were based on retrospective analyses of PICU cohorts. We aimed to compare organ dysfunction criteria in children with blood culture-proven sepsis, including emergency department, PICU, and ward patients, and to assess relevance of organ dysfunctions for mortality prediction. DESIGN: We have carried out a nonprespecified, secondary analysis of a prospective dataset collected from September 2011 to December 2015. SETTING: Emergency departments, wards, and PICUs in 10 tertiary children's hospitals in Switzerland. PATIENTS: Children younger than 17 years old with blood culture-proven sepsis. We excluded preterm infants and term infants younger than 7 days old. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC), Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2), pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA), and Pediatric Organ Dysfunction Information Update Mandate (PODIUM) scores, measured at blood culture sampling, to predict 30-day mortality. We analyzed 877 sepsis episodes in 807 children, with a 30-day mortality of 4.3%. Percentage with organ dysfunction ranged from 32.7% (IPSCC) to 55.3% (pSOFA). In adjusted analyses, the accuracy for identification of 30-day mortality was area under the curve (AUC) 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82-0.92) for IPSCC, 0.83 (0.76-0.89) for PELOD-2, 0.85 (0.78-0.92) for pSOFA, and 0.85 (0.78-0.91) for PODIUM. When restricting scores to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction, the adjusted AUC was 0.89 (0.84-0.94) for IPSCC, 0.85 (0.79-0.91) for PELOD-2, 0.87 (0.81-0.93) for pSOFA, and 0.88 (0.83-0.93) for PODIUM. CONCLUSIONS: IPSCC, PELOD-2, pSOFA, and PODIUM performed similarly to predict 30-day mortality. Simplified scores restricted to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction yielded comparable performance.",

METHODS: Single-center, retrospective cohort study in children with a diagnosis of sepsis visiting the PED and then admitted to the PICU from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019. Sepsis organ dysfunction scores-pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) (Schlapbach, Matics, Shime), quickSOFA, quickSOFA-L, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD)-2, quickPELOD-2, and Pediatric Multiple Organ Dysfunction score-were calculated during the first 24 hours of admission (day 1) and their performance compared with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and severe sepsis-International Consensus Conference on Pediatric Sepsis(ICCPS)-derived criteria-using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Primary outcome was PICU mortality. Secondary outcomes were: a composite of death and new disability (ie, change from baseline Pediatric Overall Performance Category score \u22651); prolonged PICU length of stay (>5 d); prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) (>3 d). RESULTS: Among 60 patients with sepsis, 4 (6.7%) died, 7 (11.7%) developed new disability, 26 (43.3%) experienced prolonged length of stay, and 21 (35%) prolonged invasive MV. The prognostic ability in mortality discrimination was significantly higher for organ dysfunction scores, with PELOD-2 showing the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.924; 95% confidence interval, 0.837-1.000), significantly better than SIRS 3 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P = 0.009), SIRS 4 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P < 0.001), and severe sepsis (0.924 vs 0.527, P < 0.001). Among secondary outcomes, PELOD-2 performed significantly better than SIRS criteria and severe sepsis to predict prolonged duration of invasive MV, whereas better than severe sepsis to predict \"poor outcome\" (mortality or new disability). CONCLUSIONS: Day 1 organ dysfunction scores performed better in predicting mortality and morbidity outcomes than ICCPS-derived criteria. The PELOD-2 was the organ dysfunction score with the best performance for all outcomes.",

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms \"sepsis,\" \"septicemia,\" or \"septic shock\" in the title or abstract. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001).

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a multiple dysregulated systemic inflammatory response with high mortality and leads to public concern. This study was designed to identify possible critical pathways associated with sepsis clinical severity and outcome, which offer potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. Single-cell transcriptome profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) in the healthy control population and sepsis patients were downloaded from the sepsis database GSE167363 and performed quality control before subsequent analysis. The bulk-RNA sequencing of blood samples in the sepsis-associated databases GSE100159 and GSE133822 was also used to confirm the association between critical pathways and sepsis pathology after processing raw data. We found there was a total of 18 distinct clusters in PBMC of sepsis, which was identified by the t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction analysis. Meanwhile, the main cell types including B, NK, T, and monocyte cells were identified via the cell maker website and the \"Single R\" package cell-type annotation analysis. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expression genes in each cluster found that DEGs between healthy control and sepsis patients were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway in monocyte, NK, and T cells. Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population. Taken together, we concluded that the IL-17 signaling pathway serves as a significant potential mechanism of sepsis and provides a promising therapeutic target for sepsis treatment. This research will further deepen our understanding of sepsis development.",

However, families value improvements in a range of domains following intervention and the non-motor symptoms, comorbidities and complications of CP can potentially be targeted by cell therapies. We conducted a scoping review to describe all outcomes that have been reported in cell therapy studies for CP to date, and to examine what instruments were used to capture these. Through a systematic search we identified 54 studies comprising 2066 participants that were treated with a range of cell therapy interventions. We categorized the reported 53 unique outcome instruments and additional descriptive measures into 10 categories and 12 sub-categories. Movement and Posture was the most frequently reported outcome category, followed by Safety, however Quality of Life, and various prevalent comorbidities and complications of CP were infrequently reported. Notably, many outcome instruments used do not have evaluative properties and thus are not suitable for measuring change following intervention. We provide a number of recommendations to ensure that future trials generate high-quality outcome data that is aligned with the priorities of the CP community.",

CAR is manufactured to express T cells through various ways such as using retroviruses, transposons and transposase, electroporation, and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Together, it provides flexibility since it recognizes proteins without the need of antigen processing and presentation, can recognize carbohydrates and lipids, and it has been proven to be cost-effective. Despite these benefits however, problems faced by this therapy include unrecognized tumor proteins possibly escaping the system, CAR T cell expression being transient, and the therapy being one of the most expensive cancer drug ever approved. As a result, recent progress has been ongoing where researchers have combined CAR-T cells with natural killer (NK) cells and different cytokines to maximize its efficacy and potency while limiting potential risks such as cytokine release syndrome. Consequently, these cells gained the ability to be universal-being able to be used to treat multiple patients, maintain viability for a longer period, and prevent relapse.",

The United States (US) currently has the highest annual prevalence rate of cannabis consumption in the world, 17.9% in individuals aged 12 or older, and it is on the rise. With increasing cannabis use comes the potential for an increase in abuse, and according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), approximately 5.1% of Americans had Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) in 2020. Research has shown that genetics and epigenetics play a significant role in cannabis use and CUD. In fact, approximately 50-70% of liability to CUD and 40-48% of cannabis use initiation have been found to be the result of genetic factors. Cannabis usage and CUD have also been linked to an increased risk of psychiatric disorders and Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) subsets like schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. Comprehension of the genetic and epigenetic aspects of cannabinoids is necessary for future research, treatment plans, and the production of pure cannabinoid compounds, which will be essential for FDA approval. In conclusion, having a better understanding of the epigenetic and genetic underpinnings of cannabis use, CUD, and the endocannabinoid system as a whole will aid in the development of effective FDA-approved treatment therapies and the advancement of personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "Unintended pregnancy is a global public health problem. Despite a variety of female contraceptive options, male contraceptive options are limited to the condom and vasectomy. Condoms have high failure rates and surgical vasectomy is not reliably reversible. There is a global need and desire for novel male contraceptive methods. Hormonal methods have progressed the furthest in clinical development and androgen plus progestin formulations hold promise as a marketable, reversible male contraceptive over the next decade. Investigators have tested androgen plus progestin approaches using oral, transdermal, subdermal, and injectable drug formulations and demonstrated the short-term safety and reversibility of hormonal male contraception. The most commonly reported side effects associated with hormonal male contraception include weight gain, acne, slight suppression of serum high-density cholesterol, mood changes, and changes in libido. Efficacy trials of hormonal male contraceptives have demonstrated contraceptive efficacy rates greater than that of condoms. Although there has been less progression in the development of nonhormonal male contraceptives, potentially reversible vaso-occlusive methods are currently in clinical trials in some countries. Various studies have confirmed both men and women's desire for novel male contraceptives. Barriers to development include an absence of investment from pharmaceutical companies, concerns regarding side effects and spermatogenic rebound with hormonal methods, and lack of clear reversibility and proven effectiveness of nonhormonal methods. The ultimate availability of male contraceptives could have an important impact on decreasing global unintended pregnancy rates (currently 40% of all pregnancies) and will be a step towards reproductive justice and greater equity in family planning.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "abstract": "A 74-year-old woman with ankylosing spondylitis presented with back pain and complete paraplegia after a fall. A radiologic finding of a bamboo spine, a characteristic feature of ankylosing spondylitis, was observed on computed tomography, along with a fracture-dislocation involving T10 and T11 (chalk-stick fracture) and compression of the descending thoracic aorta due to the caudal bony column. The patient underwent an open reduction and T8-L3 posterior fusion in the operating room. A complete cross-section of the spinal cord was observed during surgery. Post operation, a decrease in blood pressure led to a thoracotomy and thoracic endovascular aortic repair due to a crack in the descending aorta wall. Thoracolumbar fracture-dislocations, particularly in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, are characterized by instability and can be further complicated by concurrent vascular and spinal cord injuries. It is crucial therefore to recognize the potential for vascular and spinal cord injuries early on in such cases.",

Data collected by WHO are complemented by case reports and scientific publications. During 2011-2020, 49 cases of HAT were diagnosed in 16 non-endemic countries across five continents: 35 cases were caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, mainly in tourists visiting wildlife areas in eastern and southern Africa, and 14 cases were due to T. b. gambiense, mainly in African migrants originating from or visiting endemic areas in western and central Africa. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: HAT diagnosis in non-endemic countries is rare and can be challenging, but alertness and surveillance must be maintained to contribute to WHO's elimination goals.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Organ dysfunction severity scores (sequential organ failure assessment or SOFA) are commonly used in the adult and pediatric populations when assessing risk of mortality and adverse outcomes from sepsis. In contrast to sepsis definition in adults and children, clinical and laboratory criteria for defining neonatal sepsis have been inconclusive. More recently, studies have attempted to better understand the clinical progression of neonatal sepsis and associated mortality. This data has guided the development of a neonatal SOFA (nSOFA) score, based on common patterns of organ dysfunction observed in this population. RECENT FINDINGS: Although SOFA scores in the adult and pediatric populations have their limitations with moderate sensitivities and specificities depending on the clinical setting, the nSOFA score has been validated in predicting sepsis attributable mortality in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants across several patient cohorts. Furthermore, the nSOFA score has been adapted for use in neonatal disease states, other than sepsis, with similar prognostic utility. SUMMARY: Utilizing an nSOFA scoring system for prediction of sepsis attributable mortality in preterm infants allows for targeted interventions based on risk stratification, as well as better delineation of neonatal sepsis with subsequent improvements in research and patient safety outcomes.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The involvement of B-cells in multiple sclerosis has only recently emerged. Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the B-cell antigen CD20 with enhanced B-cell targeting. AREAS COVERED: This evaluation is of the identical ULTIMATE (UbLiTuximab In Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Effects) I and II trials comparing ublituximab (TG-1101) and teriflunomide in relapsing multiple sclerosis. The primary efficacy end point was the annualized relapse rate and was lower in the ublituximab than the teriflunomide group. EXPERT OPINION: The continuation rates to oral teriflunomide in ULTIMATE were higher than in other trials, possibly because of the supervised double-dummy protocol used with intravenous ublituximab. This may have contributed to the higher efficacy with teriflunomide in this trial than previously reported. Nevertheless, ublituximab was more effective than teriflunomide at reducing the annualized relapse rates and MRI endpoints, but not for no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the ULTIMATE trials did show that ublituximab was superior to teriflunomide in NEDA. Long-term studies of the adverse effects of ublituximab are required. Despite the positive results from ULTIMATE for ublituximab, it is still under the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and conclusions should await their findings.",

It is perceived as a low-risk drug, as it is a plant, although many warnings in the medical literature underlined increased complications of cannabis use. Acute and chronic cannabis use is known to be harmful inducing psychiatric and addictive effects. An increase in the potency of cannabis as defined by a high ratio between the more important components, tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol has been observed for years, which leads to more serious complications. Evidence indicates that both acute and chronic consumptions of cannabis can be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Effects of cannabis use include mood disorders, exacerbation of psychotic disorders in vulnerable people, cannabis use disorders, withdrawal syndrome, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular and respiratory and other diseases. Synthetic cannabinoid has rapidly spread for the last few years; they are chemical substances inducing similar psychoactive effects to cannabis. Although, cannabis users call these substances \"cannabis\", synthetic cannabinoids have different pharmacological properties, which make them dangerous substances leading to more serious complications. Physicians dealing with cannabis users should be aware of these differences between vegetal cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids. Complications somatiques du cannabis.

METHODS: Patients on standard treatment, with unilateral or bilateral lower limb (LL) or combined upper limb (UL)/LL spasticity received four incobotulinumtoxinA injection cycles (16 or 20 Units/kg bodyweight total [maximum 400 or 500 Units] per cycle depending on ambulatory status/clinical pattern treated), each followed by 12-16 weeks' observation. Treatment for pes equinus was mandatory; flexed knee or adducted thigh were options for unilateral treatment and/or ULs for unilateral/bilateral treatment. The primary endpoint was safety; changes in Ashworth Scale and Gross Motor Function Measure-66 scores, and Global Impression of Change Scale scores at week 4 of each injection cycle were also evaluated. RESULTS: IncobotulinumtoxinA (\u2264500 Units for \u226498 weeks) was safe, well-tolerated, and effective across all endpoints for multipattern treatment of LL and combined LL/UL spasticity in ambulant/nonambulant children/adolescents with CP. Treatment effects increased with each injection cycle. No new/unexpected safety concerns were identified. CONCLUSION: IncobotulinumtoxinA showed a good safety and tolerability profile, with efficacy over multiple clinical presentations.

This study aims to explore their roles and underlying mechanisms in sepsis. The blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are collected from sepsis patients and healthy donors. A sepsis mice model is established by cecal ligation puncture (CLP). The contents of cytokines are detected by ELISA. The amounts of Th17 cells, IL-17A, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, and lipopolysaccharide is significantly elevated in sepsis patients. The increased differentiation of Th17 cells can promote lung cell pyroptosis and induce hyperpermeability via activating NLRP3 inflammasome and p38 pathway. The inhibitors targeting Th17 cells, NLRP3 inflammasome, and p38 pathway can significantly alleviate lung injury in sepsis mice. Th17 cells can secrete IL-17A to activate NLRP3 inflammasome via p38 signaling pathway, which contributes to the development of sepsis-induced acute lung injury.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects adults, characterized by muscle weakness resulting from the specific death of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. The pathogenesis of ALS is associated with the accumulation of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) proteins and neurofilaments in motor neurons, highlighting the critical need for disease-modifying treatments. Current therapies, such as riluzole and edaravone, provide only symptomatic relief. Recently, tofersen gained approval from the US FDA under the brand name Qalsody as the first and only gene therapy for ALS, addressing a significant pathological aspect of the disease. METHODS: We carried out a literature survey using PubMed, Scopus, National Institutes of Health, and Biogen for articles published in the English language concerned with \"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\", pathophysiology, current treatment, treatment under clinical trial, and the newly approved drug \"tofersen\" and its detailed summary. RESULTS: A comprehensive review of the literature on the pathophysiology, available treatment, and newly approved drug for this condition revealed convincing evidence that we are now able to better monitor and treat ALS. CONCLUSIONS: Although treatment of ALS is difficult, the newly approved drug tofersen has emerged as a potential therapy to slow down the progression of ALS by targeting SOD1 mRNA, representing a significant advancement in the treatment of ALS.",

        "abstract": "The transition metal characteristics of iron allow it to play a fundamental role in several essential aspects of human life such as the transport of oxygen through hemoglobin or the transport of electrons in the mitochondrial respiratory chain coupled to the synthesis of ATP. However, an excess or deficiency of iron is related to certain pathologies. The maintenance of iron homeostasis is essential to avoid certain pathologies related to iron excess or deficiency. The existence of iron deposits in postmortem tissues of Parkinson's patients has been interpreted as evidence that iron plays a fundamental role in the degenerative process of the nigrostriatal system in this disease. The use of iron chelators has been successful in the treatment of diseases such as transfusion-dependent thalassemia and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. However, a clinical study with the iron chelator deferiprone in patients with Parkinson's disease has not shown positive effects but rather worsened clinical symptoms. This suggests that iron may not play a role in the degenerative process of Parkinson's disease.",

Diet and nu-trition, coupled with proper physical activity have a significant impact on the health status of the elderly with a decreased risk of disease being indicative of successful aging. Musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia are the most frequently reported disorders among the elderly community. METHODS: This study presents a systematic review of the literature on the potential benefits of several nutra-ceuticals in promoting healthy aging and in reducing the risk of chronic diseases in elderly individuals. RESULTS: Dietary components including vitamins (vitamin C, B vitamin and vitamin K) flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, anthocyanins, and isoflavones), minerals (e.g., magnesium, zinc and potassium) and other nutrients such phytoestrogens, amino acids, and omega-3 fatty acids help in slowing the aging process, which ultimately results in increased lifespan and longevity. CONCLUSIONS: This paper highlights the key nutrients and phytochemicals of nutraceutical importance for the healthy aging of the elderly population.

In the present study, a deep learning structure for mortality prediction of septic patients was developed and compared with several machine learning methods as well as two sepsis screening tools: the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA). The mortality predictions were explored for septic patients who died within 72 h and 28 days. Results demonstrated that the accuracy rate of deep learning methods, especially Convolutional Neural Network plus SoftMax (87.01% in 72 h and 81.59% in 28 d), exceeds that of the other machine learning methods, SIRS, and qSOFA.

They are mainly expressed during embryonic development and their role during adulthood is very limited. DDR1 has been widely studied in several types of cancers, in atherosclerosis and fibrosis, but also in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review focuses on the role of DDR1 in chronic nephropathies and on the effect of its deletion in the pathological processes involved in renal disease progression. DDR1 was shown to be de novo expressed in several models of experimental CKD. Its genetic or pharmaco-genetic inhibition led to the preservation of renal structure and function, and to decreased inflammatory influx and fibrosis. Furthermore, delayed pharmaco-genetic inhibition of DDR1 led to significant protection in models of renal disease. These results demonstrate the involvement of DDR1 in inflammatory and fibrotic processes occurring during CKD and the beneficial effect of its inhibition. Thus, DDR1 could be an interesting therapeutic target to treat renal pathologies.",

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells represent a breakthrough in personalized medicine. In this strategy, a patient's own T lymphocytes are genetically reprogrammed to encode a synthetic receptor that binds a tumor antigen, allowing T cells to recognize and kill antigen-expressing cancer cells. As a result of complete and durable responses in individuals who are refractory to standard of care therapy, CAR T cells directed against the CD19 protein have been granted United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as a therapy for treatment of pediatric and young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Human trials of CAR T cells targeting CD19 or B cell maturation antigen in multiple myeloma have also reported early successes. However, a clear and consistently reproducible demonstration of the clinical efficacy of CAR T cells in the setting of solid tumors has not been reported to date. Here, we review the history and status of CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors, potential T cell-intrinsic determinants of response and resistance as well as extrinsic obstacles to the success of this approach for much more prevalent non-hematopoietic malignancies. In addition, we summarize recent strategies and innovations that aim to augment the potency of CAR T cells in the face of multiple immunosuppressive barriers operative within the solid tumor microenvironment. Advances in the field of CAR T cell biology over the coming years in the areas of safety, reliability and efficacy against non-hematopoietic cancers will ultimately determine how transformative adoptive T cell therapy will be in the broader battle against cancer.",

        "abstract": "Despite several years of research, the aetiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is quite far from being solved. In PD, as well as in other neurodegenerative disorders, it has been proposed that the combination of multiple factors might contribute to the onset of the disease. Indeed, several authors have suggested that environmental factors, such as pollutants and chemicals, might be associated with the onset of several neurodegenerative disorders. On the other hand, several studies have described that the nociceptin/orphanin-NOP and prodynorphin-KOP opioid systems are implicated in the pathology of Parkinson's disease. Considering the nonrestricted commercial availability and common use of several pesticides, such as paraquat and maneb, in agriculture of less developed countries, the aim of our study was to investigate the involvement of nociceptin/orphanin-NOP and prodynorphin-KOP systems in a chronic paraquat and maneb animal model of Parkinson's disease. Our results showed that after paraquat/maneb (5/15 mg kg(-1) ) treatment, a significant reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis, was observed. Also, the association of paraquat and maneb (5/15 mg kg(-1) ) induced an increase in nociceptin/orphanin and a decrease of prodynorphin gene expression levels in the substantia nigra with a down-regulation of NOP and KOP receptors after both treatments in the substantia nigra and caudate putamen. These data further confirm that paraquat and maneb toxicity can modulate gene expression of the nociceptin/orphanin-NOP receptor and prodynorphin-KOP receptor systems in the substantia nigra and caudate putamen, offering further support to the hypothesis that chronic exposure to these agrochemicals might be implicated in the mechanisms underlying sporadic Parkinson's disease. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract": "Current research on personality disorders strives to identify key behavioural and cognitive facets of patient functioning, to unravel the underlying root causes and maintenance mechanisms. This process often involves the application of social paradigms - however, these often only include momentary affective depictions rather than unfolding interactions. This constitutes a limitation in our capacity to probe core symptoms, and leaves potential findings uncovered which could help those who are in close relationships with affected individuals. Here, we deployed a novel task in which subjects interact with four unknown virtual partners in a turn-taking paradigm akin to a dance, and report on their experience with each. The virtual partners embody four combinations of low/high expressivity of positive/negative mood. Higher scores on our symptomatic measures of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were all linked to a general negative appraisal of all the interpersonal experiences. Moreover, the negative appraisal of the partner who displayed a high negative/low positive mood was tied with attachment anxiety and BPD symptoms. The extent to which subjects felt responsible for causing partners' distress was most strongly linked to attachment anxiety. Finally, we provide a fully-fledged exploration of move-by-move action latencies and click distances from partners. This analysis underscored slower movement initiation from anxiously attached individuals throughout all virtual interactions. In summary, we describe a novel paradigm for second-person neuroscience, which allowed both the replication of established results and the capture of new behavioural signatures associated with attachment anxiety, and discuss its limitations.",

The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Organ dysfunction severity scores (sequential organ failure assessment or SOFA) are commonly used in the adult and pediatric populations when assessing risk of mortality and adverse outcomes from sepsis. In contrast to sepsis definition in adults and children, clinical and laboratory criteria for defining neonatal sepsis have been inconclusive. More recently, studies have attempted to better understand the clinical progression of neonatal sepsis and associated mortality. This data has guided the development of a neonatal SOFA (nSOFA) score, based on common patterns of organ dysfunction observed in this population. RECENT FINDINGS: Although SOFA scores in the adult and pediatric populations have their limitations with moderate sensitivities and specificities depending on the clinical setting, the nSOFA score has been validated in predicting sepsis attributable mortality in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants across several patient cohorts. Furthermore, the nSOFA score has been adapted for use in neonatal disease states, other than sepsis, with similar prognostic utility. SUMMARY: Utilizing an nSOFA scoring system for prediction of sepsis attributable mortality in preterm infants allows for targeted interventions based on risk stratification, as well as better delineation of neonatal sepsis with subsequent improvements in research and patient safety outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral palsy is a neurodevelopmental disease characterized by postural, motor, and cognitive disorders, being one of the main causes of physical and intellectual disability in childhood. To minimize functional impairments, the use of resveratrol as a therapeutic strategy is highlighted due to its neuroprotective and antioxidant effects in different regions of the brain. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of neonatal treatment with resveratrol on postural development, motor function, oxidative balance, and mitochondrial biogenesis in the brain of rats submitted to a cerebral palsy model. Neonatal treatment with resveratrol attenuated deficits in somatic growth, postural development, and muscle strength in rats submitted to cerebral palsy. Related to oxidative balance, resveratrol in cerebral palsy decreased the levels of MDA and carbonyls. Related to mitochondrial biogenesis, was observed in animals with cerebral palsy treated with resveratrol, an increase in mRNA levels of TFAM, in association with the increase of citrate synthase activity. The data demonstrated a promising effect of neonatal resveratrol treatment, improving postural and muscle deficits induced by cerebral palsy. These findings were associated with improvements in oxidative balance and mitochondrial biogenesis in the brain of rats submitted to cerebral palsy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pediatric patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) have a poor prognosis, with a median survival of less than 1 year. Oncolytic viral therapy has been evaluated in patients with pediatric gliomas elsewhere in the brain, but data regarding oncolytic viral therapy in patients with DIPG are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, dose-escalation study of DNX-2401, an oncolytic adenovirus that selectively replicates in tumor cells, in patients with newly diagnosed DIPG. The patients received a single virus infusion through a catheter placed in the cerebellar peduncle, followed by radiotherapy. The primary objective was to assess the safety and adverse-event profile of DNX-2401. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of DNX-2401 on overall survival and quality of life, to determine the percentage of patients who have an objective response, and to collect tumor-biopsy and peripheral-blood samples for correlative studies of the molecular features of DIPG and antitumor immune responses. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients, 3 to 18 years of age, with newly diagnosed DIPG received 1\u00d710 CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral infusion of oncolytic virus DNX-2401 followed by radiotherapy in pediatric patients with DIPG resulted in changes in T-cell activity and a reduction in or stabilization of tumor size in some patients but was associated with adverse events.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Focused ultrasound (FUS) shows promise for enhancing drug delivery to the brain by temporarily opening the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and it is increasingly used in the clinical setting to treat brain tumours. It remains however unclear whether FUS is being introduced in an ethically and methodologically sound manner. The IDEAL-D framework for the introduction of surgical innovations and the SYRCLE and ROBINS-I tools for assessing the risk of bias in animal studies and non-randomized trials, respectively, provide a comprehensive evaluation for this. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature review on FUS in neuro-oncology was conducted. Subsequently, the included studies were evaluated using the IDEAL-D framework, SYRCLE, and ROBINS-I tools. RESULTS: In total, 19 published studies and 12 registered trials were identified. FUS demonstrated successful BBB disruption, increased drug delivery, and improved survival rates. However, the SYRCLE analysis revealed a high risk of bias in animal studies, while the ROBINS-I analysis found that most human studies had a high risk of bias due to a lack of blinding and heterogeneous samples. Of the 15 pre-clinical stage 0 studies, only six had formal ethical approval, and only five followed animal care policies. Both stage 1 studies and stage 1/2a studies failed to provide information on patient data confidentiality. Overall, no animal or human study reached the IDEAL-D stage endpoint. CONCLUSION: FUS holds promise for enhancing drug delivery to the brain, but its development and implementation must adhere to rigorous safety standards using the established ethical and methodological frameworks. The complementary use of IDEAL-D, SYRCLE, and ROBINS-I tools indicates a high risk of bias and ethical limitations in both animal and human studies, highlighting the need for further improvements in study design for a safe implementation of FUS in neuro-oncology.",

        "abstract": "The potential health effects of exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) remain largely unexplored. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

METHODS: Single-center, retrospective cohort study in children with a diagnosis of sepsis visiting the PED and then admitted to the PICU from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019. Sepsis organ dysfunction scores-pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) (Schlapbach, Matics, Shime), quickSOFA, quickSOFA-L, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD)-2, quickPELOD-2, and Pediatric Multiple Organ Dysfunction score-were calculated during the first 24 hours of admission (day 1) and their performance compared with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and severe sepsis-International Consensus Conference on Pediatric Sepsis(ICCPS)-derived criteria-using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Primary outcome was PICU mortality. Secondary outcomes were: a composite of death and new disability (ie, change from baseline Pediatric Overall Performance Category score \u22651); prolonged PICU length of stay (>5 d); prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) (>3 d). RESULTS: Among 60 patients with sepsis, 4 (6.7%) died, 7 (11.7%) developed new disability, 26 (43.3%) experienced prolonged length of stay, and 21 (35%) prolonged invasive MV. The prognostic ability in mortality discrimination was significantly higher for organ dysfunction scores, with PELOD-2 showing the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.924; 95% confidence interval, 0.837-1.000), significantly better than SIRS 3 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P = 0.009), SIRS 4 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P < 0.001), and severe sepsis (0.924 vs 0.527, P < 0.001). Among secondary outcomes, PELOD-2 performed significantly better than SIRS criteria and severe sepsis to predict prolonged duration of invasive MV, whereas better than severe sepsis to predict \"poor outcome\" (mortality or new disability). CONCLUSIONS: Day 1 organ dysfunction scores performed better in predicting mortality and morbidity outcomes than ICCPS-derived criteria. The PELOD-2 was the organ dysfunction score with the best performance for all outcomes.",

We aimed to compare organ dysfunction criteria in children with blood culture-proven sepsis, including emergency department, PICU, and ward patients, and to assess relevance of organ dysfunctions for mortality prediction. DESIGN: We have carried out a nonprespecified, secondary analysis of a prospective dataset collected from September 2011 to December 2015. SETTING: Emergency departments, wards, and PICUs in 10 tertiary children's hospitals in Switzerland. PATIENTS: Children younger than 17 years old with blood culture-proven sepsis. We excluded preterm infants and term infants younger than 7 days old. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC), Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2), pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA), and Pediatric Organ Dysfunction Information Update Mandate (PODIUM) scores, measured at blood culture sampling, to predict 30-day mortality. We analyzed 877 sepsis episodes in 807 children, with a 30-day mortality of 4.3%. Percentage with organ dysfunction ranged from 32.7% (IPSCC) to 55.3% (pSOFA). In adjusted analyses, the accuracy for identification of 30-day mortality was area under the curve (AUC) 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82-0.92) for IPSCC, 0.83 (0.76-0.89) for PELOD-2, 0.85 (0.78-0.92) for pSOFA, and 0.85 (0.78-0.91) for PODIUM. When restricting scores to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction, the adjusted AUC was 0.89 (0.84-0.94) for IPSCC, 0.85 (0.79-0.91) for PELOD-2, 0.87 (0.81-0.93) for pSOFA, and 0.88 (0.83-0.93) for PODIUM. CONCLUSIONS: IPSCC, PELOD-2, pSOFA, and PODIUM performed similarly to predict 30-day mortality.

Yet we lack data in medical students who are at risk of addictive behavior. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of cannabis consumption and cannabis use disorder (CUD) among French medical students and their association with psychotropic drug consumption and psychosocial factors. Medical students were recruited from 35 French universities of medicine through administration mailing lists and social networks, between December 2016 and May 2017. Cannabis consumption was self-declared by anonymous questionnaire and CUD was defined by a Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) score\u2009\u2265\u20093. 10,985 medical students with a mean age of 21.8\u00a0years (\u00b1\u20093.3) were included, 32% of which were men. Overall, 1642 [14.9 (14.3; 15.6)%] reported cannabis consumption and 622 [5.7 (5.2; 6.1)%] students were identified with CUD at screening. Men were at two-time higher risk of cannabis consumption and three-time higher risk of CUD (22.4% and 10.6% for men vs. 11.5% and 3.4%, respectively, for women). In multivariate analyses, men sex, alcohol use disorder, tobacco smoking, parents' divorce, and history of physical assault and lower rates of lower rates of\u2009\u2265\u200940 weekly worked hours were identified as common associated factors for cannabis consumption and CUD. Hypnotic consumption, psychiatric follow-up, and history of sexual assault were identified as factors associated specifically with CUD, suggesting that these factors were associated with more severe cannabis consumption. Only 17% of students identified with CUD reported a psychiatric follow-up. Altogether, these results suggest that health policies should target cannabis consumption in medical students that is frequent, especially in men, with low rates of psychiatric follow-up. We have identified psychological factors and increased hypnotic drug consumption in CUD participants suggesting that psychiatric follow-up should be systematically proposed to this group.",

        "abstract": "Current research on personality disorders strives to identify key behavioural and cognitive facets of patient functioning, to unravel the underlying root causes and maintenance mechanisms. This process often involves the application of social paradigms - however, these often only include momentary affective depictions rather than unfolding interactions. This constitutes a limitation in our capacity to probe core symptoms, and leaves potential findings uncovered which could help those who are in close relationships with affected individuals. Here, we deployed a novel task in which subjects interact with four unknown virtual partners in a turn-taking paradigm akin to a dance, and report on their experience with each. The virtual partners embody four combinations of low/high expressivity of positive/negative mood. Higher scores on our symptomatic measures of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were all linked to a general negative appraisal of all the interpersonal experiences. Moreover, the negative appraisal of the partner who displayed a high negative/low positive mood was tied with attachment anxiety and BPD symptoms. The extent to which subjects felt responsible for causing partners' distress was most strongly linked to attachment anxiety. Finally, we provide a fully-fledged exploration of move-by-move action latencies and click distances from partners. This analysis underscored slower movement initiation from anxiously attached individuals throughout all virtual interactions. In summary, we describe a novel paradigm for second-person neuroscience, which allowed both the replication of established results and the capture of new behavioural signatures associated with attachment anxiety, and discuss its limitations.",

We aimed to evaluate the genetic profile of TLR pathway-related key genes; the myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MYD88), IL1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), the nuclear factor kappa-B1 (NFKB1), and interleukin 6 (IL6) in the blood of neonates with sepsis at the time of admission and post-treatment for the available paired-samples. This case-control study included 124 infants with sepsis admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and 17 controls. The relative gene expressions were quantified by TaqMan Real-Time qPCR and correlated to the clinic-laboratory data. MYD88, NFKB1, and IL6 relative expressions were significantly higher in sepsis cases than controls. Higher levels of MYD88 and IL6 were found in male neonates and contributed to the sex-based separation of the cases by the principal component analysis. ROC analysis revealed MYD88 and NFKB1 transcripts to be good biomarkers for sepsis. Furthermore, patients with high circulatory MYD88 levels were associated with poor survival, as revealed by Kaplan-Meier curves analysis. MYD88, NFKB1, and IL6 transcripts showed association with different poor-outcome manifestations. Clustering analysis split the patient cohort into three distinct groups according to their transcriptomic signature and CRP levels.

        "title": "Family Talk versus usual services in improving child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness (PRIMERA-Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parental mental illness is common and can lead to dependent children incurring a high risk of developing mental disorders, physical illness, and impaired educational and occupational outcomes. Family Talk is one of the better known interventions designed to prevent the intergenerational transmission of mental illness. However, its evidence base is small, with few robust independent randomised controlled trials, and no associated process or cost evaluations. The PRIMERA (Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children) research programme involves a mixed method evaluation of Family Talk which is being delivered in mental health settings in Ireland to improve child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness. METHODS: The study comprises a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT), with nested economic and process evaluations, to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness and implementation mechanisms of Family Talk compared to usual services. The study is being conducted in 15 adult and child mental health settings in Ireland. Families with a parent with mental illness, and children aged 5-18\u2009years (n\u2009=\u2009144 families) will be randomised to either the 7-session Family Talk programme (n\u2009=\u200996) or to standard care (n\u2009=\u200948) using a 2:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcomes are child psychosocial functioning and family functioning. Secondary outcomes are as follows: understanding and experience of parental mental illness, parental mental health, child and parental resilience, partner wellbeing and service utilisation. Blind assessments will take place at pre-intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Given the prevalence and burden of intergenerational mental illness, it is imperative that prevention through evidence-based interventions becomes a public health priority. The current study will provide an important contribution to the international evidence base for Family Talk whilst also helping to identify key implementation lessons in the scaling up of Family Talk, and other similar interventions, within routine mental health settings.

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Widespread adoption of rapid genomic testing in pediatric critical care requires robust clinical and laboratory pathways that provide equitable and consistent service across health care systems. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the performance of a multicenter network for ultra-rapid genomic diagnosis in a public health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Descriptive feasibility study of critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions treated at 12 Australian hospitals between March 2018 and February 2019, with data collected to May 2019. A formal implementation strategy emphasizing communication and feedback, standardized processes, coordination, distributed leadership, and collective learning was used to facilitate adoption. EXPOSURES: Ultra-rapid exome sequencing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report. The secondary outcomes were the molecular diagnostic yield, the change in clinical management after the ultra-rapid exome sequencing report, the time from hospital admission to the laboratory report, and the proportion of laboratory reports returned prior to death or hospital discharge. RESULTS: The study population included 108 patients with a median age of 28 days (range, 0 days to 17 years); 34% were female; and 57% were from neonatal intensive care units, 33% were from pediatric intensive care units, and 9% were from other hospital wards. The mean time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 3.3 days (95% CI, 3.2-3.5 days) and the median time was 3 days (range, 2-7 days). The mean time from hospital admission to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 17.5 days (95% CI, 14.6-21.1 days) and 93 reports (86%) were issued prior to death or hospital discharge. A molecular diagnosis was established in 55 patients (51%). Eleven diagnoses (20%) resulted from using the following approaches to augment standard exome sequencing analysis: mitochondrial genome sequencing analysis, exome sequencing-based copy number analysis, use of international databases to identify novel gene-disease associations, and additional phenotyping and RNA analysis. In 42 of 55 patients (76%) with a molecular diagnosis and 6 of 53 patients (11%) without a molecular diagnosis, the ultra-rapid exome sequencing result was considered as having influenced clinical management. Targeted treatments were initiated in 12 patients (11%), treatment was redirected toward palliative care in 14 patients (13%), and surveillance for specific complications was initiated in 19 patients (18%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests feasibility of ultra-rapid genomic testing in critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions in the Australian public health care system. However, further research is needed to understand the clinical value of such testing, and the generalizability of the findings to other health care settings.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The study aims to investigate the social, emotional, and behavioral challenges in children with a specific learning disability (SLD) and to identify the factors that accompany these problems by screening with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). METHODS: The descriptive study was conducted on 278 children with SLD. Strengths and difficulties in children were evaluated by the SDQ applied to their mothers. The percentage of cases above the cut-off limits of the SDQ was calculated. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis were used for analysis. RESULTS: The mean (SD) total SDQ score was 15.8 (6.5). The percentage of scores of abnormal total difficulties in SLD was 47.8%. Multivariate analysis revealed that cases exposed to antenatal smoking had higher odds ratio of abnormal emotional symptoms and abnormal total difficulties; cases with poor familial income and the presence of a history of antenatal smoking exposure showed considerably higher odds ratio of conduct problems; cases with younger age at the diagnosis of SLD, dyscalculia, extreme duration of preschool screen time (\u22654\u00a0h), and history of hospitalization had significantly higher odds ratio for hyperactivity-inattention problems; and cases having shorter breastfeeding duration had higher odds ratio of peer problems compared to counterparts. CONCLUSION: Children with SLD have a high score on the SDQ. Practitioners could especially give guidance and support to families with financial problems and those having a child with an early age at diagnosis, exposure to antenatal smoking, short breastfeeding period, early age of the first screen use, and long screen exposure duration during the preschool period.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To study the metabolic mechanism of neonatal sepsis at different stages by analyzing the metabolic pathways involving the serum metabolites with significant differences in neonates with sepsis at different time points after admission. METHODS: A total of 20 neonates with sepsis who were hospitalized in the Department of Neonatology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, from January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2020 were enrolled as the sepsis group. Venous blood samples were collected on days 1, 4, and 7 after admission. Ten healthy neonates who underwent physical examination during the same period were enrolled as the control group. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for the metabonomic analysis of serum samples to investigate the change in metabolomics in neonates with sepsis at different time points. RESULTS: On day 1 after admission, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between the sepsis and control groups were mainly involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid skeleton. For the sepsis group, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 4 after admission were mainly involved in pyruvate metabolism, and those between days 4 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in the metabolism of cysteine and methionine. The differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in ascorbic acid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic mechanism of serum metabolites varies at different stages in neonates with sepsis and is mainly associated with terpenoid skeleton biosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism, cysteine/methionine metabolism, and ascorbic acid metabolism.

        "title": "Male contraception: narrative review of ongoing research.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the release of the combined oral contraceptive pill in 1960, women have shouldered the burden of contraception and family planning. Over 60 years later, this is still the case as the only practical, effective contraceptive options available to men are condoms and vasectomy. However, there are now a variety of promising hormonal and non-hormonal male contraceptive options being studied. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide clinicians and laypeople with focused, up-to-date descriptions of novel strategies and targets for male contraception. We include a cautiously optimistic discussion of benefits and potential drawbacks, highlighting several methods in preclinical and clinical stages of development. RESULTS: As of June 2023, two hormonal male contraceptive methods are undergoing phase II clinical trials for safety and efficacy. A large-scale, international phase IIb trial investigating efficacy of transdermal segesterone acetate (Nestorone) plus testosterone gel has enrolled over 460 couples with completion estimated for late 2024. A second hormonal method, dimethandrolone undecanoate, is in two clinical trials focusing on safety, pharmacodynamics, suppression of spermatogenesis and hormones; the first of these two is estimated for completion in December 2024. There are also several non-hormonal methods with strong potential in preclinical stages of development. CONCLUSIONS: There exist several hurdles to novel male contraception. Therapeutic development takes decades of time, meticulous work, and financial investment, but with so many strong candidates it is our hope that there will soon be several safe, effective, and reversible contraceptive options available to male patients. R\u00e9SUM\u00e9: CONTEXTE: Depuis la sortie de la pilule contraceptive orale combin\u00e9e en 1960, les femmes ont assum\u00e9 le fardeau de la contraception et de la planification familiale. Plus de 60 ans plus tard, c\u2019est toujours le cas, car les seules options contraceptives pratiques et efficaces disponibles pour les hommes sont les pr\u00e9servatifs et la vasectomie. Cependant, il existe maintenant une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019options contraceptives masculines hormonales et non hormonales prometteuses qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude. Le but de cette revue narrative est de fournir aux cliniciens et aux profanes des descriptions cibl\u00e9es et \u00e0 jour de nouvelles strat\u00e9gies et cibles pour la contraception masculine. Nous incluons une discussion prudemment optimiste sur les avantages et les inconv\u00e9nients potentiels, en soulignant plusieurs m\u00e9thodes aux stades pr\u00e9cliniques et cliniques du d\u00e9veloppement. R\u00e9SULTATS: En juin 2023, deux m\u00e9thodes contraceptives masculines hormonales faisaient l\u2019objet d\u2019essais cliniques de phase II pour leur innocuit\u00e9 et leur efficacit\u00e9. Un essai international de phase IIb \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle, portant sur l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de l\u2019ac\u00e9tate de s\u00e9gest\u00e9rone transdermique (Nestorone) et du gel de testost\u00e9rone, a recrut\u00e9 plus de 460 couples et devrait \u00eatre achev\u00e9 pour la fin de 2024. Une seconde m\u00e9thode hormonale, l\u2019und\u00e9canoate de dim\u00e9thandrolone, fait l\u2019objet de deux essais cliniques ax\u00e9s sur l\u2019innocuit\u00e9, la pharmacodynamique, la suppression de la spermatogen\u00e8se et des hormones; le premier de ces deux essais devrait \u00eatre achev\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 2024. Il existe \u00e9galement plusieurs m\u00e9thodes non hormonales \u00e0 fort potentiel aux stades pr\u00e9cliniques de d\u00e9veloppement.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transmembrane (TMEM) protein genes are a class of proteins that spans membranes and function to many physiological processes. However, there is very little known about TMEM gene expression, especially in cancer tissue. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequence may facilitate the understanding of this poorly characterized protein genes in PDAC. METHODS: We selected the TMEM family genes through the Human Protein Atlas and characterized their expression by single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. Identification of the key TMEM genes was performed through three machine learning algorithms: LASSO, SVM-RFE and RF-SRC. Then, we established TMEM gene riskscore and estimate its implication in predicting survival and response to systematic therapy. Additionally, we explored the difference and impact of TMEM gene expression in PDAC through immunohistochemistry and cell line research. RESULTS: 5 key TMEM genes (ANO1, TMEM59, TMEM204, TMEM205, TMEM92) were selected based on the single-cell analysis and machine learning survival outcomes. Patients stratified into the high and low-risk groups based on TMEM riskscore, were observed with distinct overall survival in internal and external datasets. Moreover, through bulk RNA-sequence and immunohistochemical staining we verified the protein expression of TMEM genes in PDAC and revealed TMEM92 as an essential regulator of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSION: Our study on TMEM gene expression and behavior in PDAC has revealed unique characteristics, offering potential for precise therapeutic approaches. Insights into molecular mechanisms expand understanding of PDAC complexity and TMEM gene roles. Such knowledge may inform targeted therapy development, benefiting patients.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Organ dysfunction severity scores (sequential organ failure assessment or SOFA) are commonly used in the adult and pediatric populations when assessing risk of mortality and adverse outcomes from sepsis. In contrast to sepsis definition in adults and children, clinical and laboratory criteria for defining neonatal sepsis have been inconclusive. More recently, studies have attempted to better understand the clinical progression of neonatal sepsis and associated mortality. This data has guided the development of a neonatal SOFA (nSOFA) score, based on common patterns of organ dysfunction observed in this population. RECENT FINDINGS: Although SOFA scores in the adult and pediatric populations have their limitations with moderate sensitivities and specificities depending on the clinical setting, the nSOFA score has been validated in predicting sepsis attributable mortality in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants across several patient cohorts. Furthermore, the nSOFA score has been adapted for use in neonatal disease states, other than sepsis, with similar prognostic utility. SUMMARY: Utilizing an nSOFA scoring system for prediction of sepsis attributable mortality in preterm infants allows for targeted interventions based on risk stratification, as well as better delineation of neonatal sepsis with subsequent improvements in research and patient safety outcomes.",

        "title": "Oncolytic viruses as a promising therapeutic strategy against the detrimental health impacts of air pollution: The case of glioblastoma multiforme.",
        "abstract": "Human livelihood highly depends on applying different sources of energy whose utilization is associated with air pollution. On the other hand, air pollution may be associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Unlike other environmental causes of cancer (e.g., irradiation), air pollution cannot efficiently be controlled by geographical borders, regulations, and policies. The unavoidable exposure to air pollution can modify cancer incidence and mortality. GBM treatment with chemotherapy or even its surgical removal has proven insufficient (100% recurrence rate; patient's survival mean of 15 months; 90% fatality within five years) due to glioma infiltrative and migratory capacities. Given the barrage of attention and research investments currently plowed into next-generation cancer therapy, oncolytic viruses are perhaps the most vigorously pursued. Provision of an insight into the current state of the research and future direction is essential for stimulating new ideas with the potentials of filling research gaps. This review manuscript aims to overview types of brain cancer, their burden, and different causative agents. It also describes why air pollution is becoming a concerning factor. The different opinions on the association of air pollution with brain cancer are reviewed. It tries to address the significant controversy in this field by hypothesizing the air-pollution-brain-cancer association via inflammation and atopic conditions. The last section of this review deals with the oncolytic viruses, which have been used in, or are still under clinical trials for GBM treatment. Engineered adenoviruses (i.e., DNX-2401, DNX-2440, CRAd8-S-pk7 loaded Neural stem cells), herpes simplex virus type 1 (i.e., HSV-1 C134, HSV-1 rQNestin34.5v.2, HSV-1 G207, HSV-1 M032), measles virus (i.e., MV-CEA), parvovirus (i.e., ParvOryx), poliovirus (i.e., Poliovirus PVSRIPO), reovirus (i.e., pelareorep), moloney murine leukemia virus (i.e., Toca 511 vector), and vaccinia virus (i.e., vaccinia virus TG6002) as possible life-changing alleviations for GBM have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first review that comprehensively discusses both (i) the negative/positive association of air pollution with GBM; and (ii) the application of oncolytic viruses for GBM, including the most recent advances and clinical trials. It is also the first review that addresses the controversies over air pollution and brain cancer association. We believe that the article will significantly appeal to a broad readership of virologists, oncologists, neurologists, environmentalists, and those who work in the field of (bio)energy. Policymakers may also use it to establish better health policies and regulations about air pollution and (bio)fuels exploration, production, and consumption.",

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has become the standard of care for children and young adults with relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and it is a highly promising therapy under investigation for adults with relapsed disease. Despite having potentially life-threatening toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, the benefits of CAR T-cell therapy far outweigh these risks, particularly as increased experience and improved supportive care measures are mitigating these toxicities. CAR T cells can result in complete remission for significant proportion of patients with relapsed and refractory B-ALL and permit them to proceed to potentially curative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). CAR T cells may also be curative by themselves. Herein lie the greatest challenges and questions for clinical investigators, specifically, how are CAR T cells best employed and how do we overcome mechanisms of resistance to them? The primary clinical question is the timing and even the necessity of allo-HSCT. Relative to resistance, we know that target antigen loss, specifically CD19, is a major contributor to resistance. However, current investigations of alternative targets, such CD22, and CAR T cells expressing dual targeting antigen receptors have demonstrated encouraging initial results and provide a high degree of optimism that the efficacy and the broader application of CAR T-cell therapy will gradually increase in B-ALL. That optimism is not as high and the challenges are increased for the application of CAR T cells in T-cell leukemias and acute myeloid leukemia due to the relative lack of suitable leukemia surface targets that are not also expressed on normal hematopoietic progenitors. Despite these significant challenges, considerable research is being conducted into the development of CAR T cells for these diseases utilizing unique technologies, which may be applicable to other diseases.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence is a prevalent public health issue associated with all-cause maternal mortality. This study investigated the relationship between intimate partner violence, severe acute maternal morbidity in the intensive care unit (ICU), and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study in a hospital in Lima, Peru, with 109 cases (maternal ICU admissions) and 109 controls (obstetric patients not admitted to the ICU). Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and medical record review. Partner violence was assessed using the World Health Organization instrument. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the association between intimate partner violence and severe acute maternal morbidity. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher rate of intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy among cases (58.7%) than controls (27.5%). In multivariate analysis, intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy (aOR 3.83 (95% CI: 1.99-7.37)), being married (3.86 (1.27-11.73)), having <8 antenatal care visits (2.78 (1.14-6.80)), and having previous abortions (miscarriage, therapeutic, or unsafe) (1.69 (1.13-2.51)) were significantly associated with severe acute maternal morbidity. The ICU admission rate was 18.8 (per 1000 live births), and ICU maternal mortality was 1.7%. The perinatal mortality rate was higher in cases (9.3%) than in controls (1.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Intimate partner violence was associated with an increased risk of severe acute maternal morbidity. This suggests a more severe impact of intimate partner violence on pregnancy than has been previously identified. Inquiring about intimate partner violence during prenatal visits may prevent further harm to the mother-baby dyad.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ublituximab, a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting a unique epitope on the CD20 antigen, is glycoengineered for enhanced B-cell targeting through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Greater ADCC may allow lower doses and shorter infusion times versus other anti-CD20 mAbs. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine optimal dose, infusion time, and activity of ublituximab in relapsing multiple sclerosis. METHODS: This is a phase 2, placebo-controlled study. Patients received three ublituximab infusions (150\u2009mg over 1-4\u2009hours on day 1 and 450-600\u2009mg over 1-3\u2009hours on day 15 and week 24) in six dosing cohorts. The primary endpoint was B-cell depletion. RESULTS: In all cohorts ( CONCLUSION: Ublituximab was safely infused as rapid as 1\u2009hour, producing robust B-cell depletion and profound reductions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity and relapses.",

        "title": "Statistical approaches for evaluating body composition markers in clinical cancer research.",
        "abstract": "The term 'morphomics' stands for the markers of body composition in muscle and adipose tissues. in recent years, as part of clinical cancer research, several associations between morphomics and outcome or toxicity were found in different treatment settings leading to a growing interest. we aim to review statistical approaches used to evaluate these markers and suggest practical statistical recommendations. Area covered: We identified statistical methods used recently to take into account properties of morphomics measurements. We also reviewed adjustment methods on major confounding factors such as gender and approaches to model morphomic data, especially mixed models for repeated measures. Finally, we focused on methods for determining a cut-off for a morphomic marker that could be used in clinical practice and how to assess its robustness. Expert commentary: From our review, we proposed 13 key points to strengthen analyses and reporting of clinical research assessing associations between morphomics and outcome or toxicity.",
