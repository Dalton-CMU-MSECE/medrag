This retrospective study reviewed the clinical characteristics of cases of culture-proven sepsis in a neonatal intensive care unit from January 1992 to December 2001. Patients were divided into those with onset of sepsis in the first 7 days of life (early-onset group) and those with onset after the seventh day of life (late-onset group). A total of 270 cases with 325 episodes of sepsis and 353 isolated pathogens were identified and included in the study. The male-to-female ratio was 1.4. The majority of cases of sepsis occurred in low birth weight (75.9%) and premature babies (76.7%). Late onset occurred in 71.9% of cases. Patients with late onset had a lower mortality rate than those with early onset (11.3% vs 28.9%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci (20.1%) was the most common organism isolated, but infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was associated with the highest morality rate (55.0%). Late-onset sepsis was significantly more common in very low birth weight and premature infants. The most frequently encountered pathogens in the early-onset group were group B streptococci (GBS) and Escherichia coli, while in the late-onset group, the organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci and Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. GBS infection resulted in the highest mortality when the onset of sepsis was within the first 24 hours of life.",

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence, aetiology and outcomes of physician-diagnosed sepsis in hospitalised neonates who had previously been discharged home after delivery in Soweto, South Africa. METHODS: A retrospective review using data abstracted from clinical and laboratory databases identified physician-diagnosed sepsis cases in neonates admitted to the general paediatric wards at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital from January 2015 to September 2016. Neonates with physician-diagnosed sepsis were categorised into two groups based on putative pathogens recovered from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid specimens: (i) culture-confirmed sepsis; and (ii) culture-negative sepsis. RESULTS: Of 1\u00a0826 neonatal admissions, 1\u00a0025 (56.2%) had physician-diagnosed sepsis: 166 (16.2%) with culture-confirmed sepsis and 859 (83.8%) with culture-negative neonatal sepsis. The commonest pathogens causing culture-confirmed neonatal sepsis were Streptococcus viridans (n=53; 26.5%), S. agalactiae (n=38; 19.0%), and Staphylococcus aureus (n=25; 12.5%). The case fatality rates for culture-confirmed sepsis and culture-negative sepsis were 10.8% (18/166) and 2.6% (22/859), respectively. The odds of death occurring during hospitalisation was 10-fold (95% confidence interval 3.7 - 26.9) higher in neonates with culture-confirmed sepsis compared with culture-negative sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, physician-diagnosed sepsis represents a huge disease burden in previously healthy neonates hospitalised from home. Most sepsis cases were attributed to S. viridans, S. agalactiae and S. aureus.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The Sepsis-3 consensus task force defined sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection. However, the clinical criteria for this definition were neither designed for nor validated in children. We validated the performance of SIRS, age-adapted SOFA, quick SOFA and PELOD-2 scores as predictors of outcome in children. METHODS: We performed a multicentre binational cohort study of patients\u00a0<\u00a018\u00a0years admitted with infection to ICUs in Australia and New Zealand. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. SIRS, age-adapted SOFA, quick SOFA and PELOD-2 scores were compared using crude and adjusted area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis. RESULTS: Of 2594 paediatric ICU admissions due to infection, 151 (5.8%) children died, and 949/2594 (36.6%) patients died or experienced an ICU length of stay\u00a0\u2265\u00a03\u00a0days. A\u00a0\u2265\u00a02-point increase in the individual score was associated with a crude mortality increase from 3.1 to 6.8% for SIRS, from 1.9 to 7.6% for age-adapted SOFA, from 1.7 to 7.3% for PELOD-2, and from 3.9 to 8.1% for qSOFA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The discrimination of outcomes was significantly higher for SOFA (adjusted AUROC 0.829; 0.791-0.868) and PELOD-2 (0.816; 0.777-0.854) than for qSOFA (0.739; 0.695-0.784) and SIRS (0.710; 0.664-0.756). CONCLUSIONS: SIRS criteria lack specificity to identify children with infection at substantially higher risk of mortality. We demonstrate that adapting Sepsis-3 to age-specific criteria performs better than Sepsis-2-based criteria. Our findings support the translation of Sepsis-3 into paediatric-specific sepsis definitions and highlight the importance of robust paediatric organ dysfunction characterization.",

        "abstract": "The first days of postnatal life are energetically demanding as metabolic functions change dramatically to accommodate drastic environmental and physiologic transitions after birth. It is increasingly appreciated that metabolic pathways are not only crucial for nutrition but also play important roles in regulating inflammation and the host response to infection. Neonatal susceptibility to infection is increased due to a functionally distinct immune response characterized by high reliance on innate immune mechanisms. Interactions between metabolism and the immune response are increasingly recognized, as changes in metabolic pathways drive innate immune cell function and activation and consequently host response to pathogens. Moreover, metabolites, such as acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and succinate have immunoregulatory properties and serve as cofactors for enzymes involved in epigenetic reprogramming or \"training\" of innate immune cells after an initial infectious exposure. Highly sensitive metabolomic approaches allow us to define alterations in metabolic signatures as they change during ontogeny and as perturbed by immunization or infection, thereby linking metabolic pathways to immune cell effector functions. Characterizing the ontogeny of immunometabolism will offer new opportunities to prevent, diagnose, and treat neonatal sepsis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Septic shock occurs when sepsis is related to severe hypotension and leads to a remarkable high number of deaths. The early diagnosis of septic shock is essential to reduce mortality. High-quality biomarkers can be objectively measured and evaluated as indicators to accurately predict disease diagnosis. However, single-gene prediction efficiency is inadequate; therefore, we identified a risk-score model based on gene signature to elevate predictive efficiency. METHODS: The gene expression profiles of GSE33118 and GSE26440 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. These two datasets were merged, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package in R software. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichments of DEGs were performed. Subsequently, Lasso regression and Boruta feature selection algorithm were combined to identify the hub genes of septic shock. GSE9692 was then subjected to weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify the septic shock-related gene modules. Subsequently, the genes within such modules that matched with septic shock-related DEGs were identified as the hub genes of septic shock. To further understand the function and signaling pathways of hub genes, we performed gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and then used the CIBERSORT tool to analyze the immune cell infiltration pattern of diseases. The diagnostic value of hub genes in septic shock was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and verified using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting in our hospital patients with septic shock. RESULTS: A total of 975 DEGs in the GSE33118 and GSE26440 databases were obtained, of which 30 DEGs were remarkably upregulated.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Paediatric Early Warning Scores (PEWS) are widely used in the UK, but the heterogeneity across tools and the limited data on their predictive performance represent obstacles to improving best practice. The standardisation of practice through the proposed National PEWS will rely on robust validation. Therefore, we compared the performance of the National PEWS with six other PEWS currently used in NHS hospitals, for their ability to predict critical care (CC) admission in febrile children attending the emergency department (ED). DESIGN: Retrospective single-centre cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary hospital paediatric ED. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 11 449 eligible febrile ED attendances were identified from the electronic patient record over a 2-year period. Seven PEWS scores were calculated (Alder Hey, Bedside, Bristol, National, Newcastle and Scotland PEWS, and the Paediatric Observation Priority Score, using the worst observations recorded during their ED stay. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was CC admission within 48 hours, the secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) >48 hours and sepsis-related mortality. RESULTS: Of 11 449 febrile children, 134 (1.2%) were admitted to CC within 48 hours of ED presentation, 606 (5.3%) had a hospital LOS >48 hours. 10 (0.09%) children died, 5 (0.04%) were sepsis-related. All seven PEWS demonstrated excellent discrimination for CC admission (range area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) 0.91-0.95) and sepsis-related mortality (range AUC 0.95-0.99), most demonstrated moderate discrimination for hospital LOS (range AUC 0.69-0.75). In CC admission threshold analyses, bedside PEWS (AUC 0.90; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.93) and National PEWS (AUC 0.90; 0.87-0.93) were the most discriminative, both at a threshold of \u22656. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of the proposed National PEWS in the paediatric ED for the recognition of suspected sepsis to improve outcomes, but further validation is required in other settings and presentations.",

There has been a debate in psychiatry about whether or not we can infer a cause-and-effect relationship between the use of cannabis and psychotic disorders. In this editorial, we first present and critically discuss the evidence to date of the association between heavy cannabis use and psychosis. We argue that while the biological mechanisms underlying individual susceptibility to develop a psychotic disorder following heavy cannabis use are still unknown, heavy cannabis use remains the most modifiable risk factor for the onset of psychotic disorders and for its clinical and functional outcome.

DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). PATIENTS: Ninety-four children. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Leucocyte count, PCT and CRP were measured when considered necessary during the PICU stay. Patients were classified, when PCT and CRP were measured, into one of six categories (negative, SIRS, localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock) according to the definitions of the American College of Chest Physicians /Society of Critical Care Medicine. A total of 359 patient day episodes were obtained. Leucocyte count did not differ across the six diagnostic classes considered. Median plasma PCT concentrations were 0.17, 0.43, 0.79, 1.80, 15.40 and 19.13 ng/ml in negative, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock groups, respectively, whereas median plasma CRP concentrations were 1.35, 3.80, 6.45, 5.70, 7.60 and 16.2 mg/dl, respectively. The area under the ROC curve for the diagnosis of septic patients was 0.532 for leucocyte count (95% CI, 0.462-0.602), 0.750 for CRP (95% CI, 0.699-0.802) and 0.912 for PCT (95% CI, 0.882-0.943). We obtained four groups using CRP values and five groups using PCT values that classified a significant percentage of patients according to the severity of the different SIRS groups. CONCLUSIONS: PCT is a better diagnostic marker of sepsis in critically ill children than CRP.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical data and plasma levels of biomarkers were collected longitudinally. We used a complementary log-log model to account for the daily mortality risk of each patient until death in ICU/hospital, discharge, or 28 days after admission. The model, which is a versatile version of the Cox model for gaining longitudinal insights, created a composite indicator (the daily hazard of dying) from the \"day 1\" and \"change\" variables of six time-varying biological indicators (cell-free DNA, protein C, platelet count, creatinine, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and lactate) and a set of contextual variables (age, presence of chronic lung disease or previous brain injury, and duration of stay), achieving a high predictive power (conventional area under the curve, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94). Including change variables avoided misleading inferences about the effects of day 1 variables, signifying the importance of the longitudinal approach. We then generated mortality risk profiles that highlight the relative contributions among the time-varying biological indicators to overall mortality risk. The tool was validated in 28 nonseptic patients from the same ICUs who became septic later and was subject to 10-fold cross-validation, achieving similarly high area under the curve. CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel version of the Cox model, we created a prognostic tool for septic patients that yields not only a predicted probability of dying but also a mortality risk profile that reveals how six time-varying biological indicators differentially and longitudinally account for the patient's overall daily mortality risk.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to derive a novel prognostic score for mortality in paediatric meningococcal sepsis (MS) based on readily available laboratory markers. METHODS: A multicentre retrospective cohort study for the consortium set and a single centre retrospective study for replication set. The consortium set were 1,073 children (age 1 week to 17.9 years) referred over a 15-year period (1996 to 2011), who had an admission diagnosis of MS, referred to paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in six different European centres. The consortium set was split into a development set and validation set to derive the score. The replication set were 134 children with MS (age 2 weeks to 16 years) referred over a 4-year period (2007 to 2011) to PICUs via the Children's Acute Transport Service (CATS), London. RESULTS: A total of 85/1,073 (7.9%) children in the consortium set died. A total of 16/134 (11.9%) children in the replication set died. Children dying in the consortium set had significantly lower base excess, C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet and white cell count, more deranged coagulation and higher lactate than survivors. Paediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) score, Glasgow meningococcal septicaemia prognosis score (GMSPS) and Rotterdam score were also higher. Using the consortium set, a new scoring system using base excess and platelet count at presentation, termed the BEP score, was mathematically developed and validated. BEP predicted mortality with high sensitivity and specificity scores (area under the curve (AUC) in the validation set=0.86 and in the replication set=0.96). In the validation set, BEP score performance (AUC=0.86, confidence interval (CI): 0.80 to 0.91) was better than GMSPS (AUC=0.77, CI: 0.68, 0.85), similar to Rotterdam (AUC=0.87, CI: 0.81 to 0.93) and not as good as PRISM (AUC=0.93, CI: 0.85 to 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: The BEP score, relying on only two variables that are quickly and objectively measurable and readily available at presentation, is highly sensitive and specific in predicting death from MS in childhood.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis contributes to great mortality and morbidity among very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants. Prevalence and pathogen distribution of sepsis in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) vary with time and geographic location. Such information serves as a guide for selection of empirical antibiotics coverage. METHODS: This is a case series study performed by retrospective chart review of VLBW infants (birth body weight, BBW, <1500 g) in a medical center during a 5-year period from January 2005 to December 2009. Episodes of positive blood cultures, pathogen distribution and related clinical manifestations were described. RESULTS: A total of 158 episodes of sepsis were identified from 1042 VLBW infants. Sepsis rate was 152 per 1000 live births. The vast majority of infections (60.7%) were caused by Gram-positive organisms [G(+)], and overall Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (52.5%) were the most common pathogen identified. Prevalence for early-onset sepsis (EOS) was 1% and for late-onset sepsis (LOS) was 14.2%. Infants with EOS had a much higher case fatality rate than LOS (40% vs. 4.7%). Escherichia coli (40%) were the leading pathogen of EOS while CoNS (54.7%) was the leading pathogens of LOS. Overall, apnea and/or bradycardia and/or cyanosis (65.8%), poor activity (48.7%), and increased respiratory effort (43.0%) were the most common presenting features of sepsis. CONCLUSION: Unlike term infants, Gram-negative organism and E coli were the leading pathogen of EOS among VLBW infants. Judicious and timely use of antibiotic therapy is crucial in the care of VLBW infants.",

        "abstract": "Vitamin K2 activates vitamin K-dependent proteins that support many biological functions, such as bone mineralization, the inhibition of vascular stiffness, the improvement of endothelial function, the maintenance of strong teeth, brain development, joint health, and optimal body weight. Due to the transformation of food habits in developed countries over the last five decades, vitamin K and, specifically, vitamin K2 intakes among parents and their offspring have decreased significantly, resulting in serious health implications. The therapeutics used in pediatric practice (antibiotics and glucocorticoids) are also to blame for this situation. Low vitamin K status is much more frequent in newborns, due to both endogenous and exogenous insufficiencies. Just after birth vitamin K stores are low, and since human milk is relatively poor in this nutrient, breast-fed infants are at particular risk of a bleeding disorder called vitamin K deficiency bleeding. A pilot study showed that better vitamin K status is associated with lower rate of low-energy fracture incidence. An ongoing clinical trial is intended to address whether vitamin K2 and D3 supplementation might positively impact the biological process of bone healing. Vitamin K2 as menaquinone-7 (MK-7) has a documented history of safe and effective use. The lack of adverse effects of MK-7 makes it the ideal choice for supplementation by pregnant and nursing women and children, both healthy and suffering from various malabsorptions and health disorders, such as dyslipidemia, diabetes, thalassemia major (TM), cystic fibrosis (CF), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), and chronic liver diseases. Additionally, worthy of consideration is the use of vitamin K2 in obesity-related health outcomes.",

Lecanemab is anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease but is only marginally effective. Other antibodies are being developed including solanezumab. AREAS COVERED: A phase 3 clinical trial of solanezumab in preclinical Alzheimer's disease. In the A4 study, solanezumab did not reduce the decline in cognition or function and had no effect on brain amyloid burden. EXPERT OPINION: After the poor results in the EXPEDITION series of trials, the development of solanezumab should have been terminated. The rationale for undertaking the A4 trial was questionable, and the lack of benefit was probable. The controversial approval of two anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies (aducanumab and lecanemab) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), despite a high incidence of amyloid-related imagining abnormalities (ARIA), may be fueling this continuation of clinical development of agents such as solanezumab. The lesson from the A4 trial is that more careful/realistic consideration needs to be given before embarking on further phase 3 trials with anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies.",

The mortality predictions were explored for septic patients who died within 72 h and 28 days. Results demonstrated that the accuracy rate of deep learning methods, especially Convolutional Neural Network plus SoftMax (87.01% in 72 h and 81.59% in 28 d), exceeds that of the other machine learning methods, SIRS, and qSOFA.

Six years old--the age at which children start the elementary school--is a key age for this screening. At the request of practitioners, a multidisciplinary staff had developed a screening tool: ERTLA6 (Epreuves de rep\u00e9rage des troubles du langage et des apprentissages de l'enfant de 6 ans). The objective was to validate the capacity of ERTLA6 to predict the school performance. A sample of 187 children was randomly constituted among the whole population of last year nursery school children in an area of France (the Acad\u00e9mie de Nancy-Metz). Those children, aged from 5 to 6, were screened with ERTLA6 by the school practitioner during a medical visit (score from 0 [the best] to 18 [the worse]). The School outcomes (considered as judgment criteria) were assessed 2 or 3 years later, after two years of elementary school. 148 children had completed their follow-up (the others: 27 moving house, 6 absents the day of evaluation, 2 missing data). Mean age was 5; 10 years. With a threshold > or = 7, ERTLA6 sensibility and specificity were respectively 79% [63-94] and 87% [81-93]; the positive predictive value was 58% [42-74], the negative predictive value was 95% [90-99]. The percentage of well classified children was 84% [69-99].

Unfortunately, interventions that simultaneously address cannabis use and co-occurring psychiatric disorders are limited in availability. Targeted digital interventions to reduce cannabis use could be beneficial for patients with psychiatric disorders. Digital interventions could be easily disseminated and used in numerous clinical locations, including outpatient, inpatient, residential, and community psychiatric treatment settings. METHODS: Literature on digital cannabis reduction interventions for persons with psychiatric disorders was examined between April 2021 and June 2021. Articles were obtained from PubMed and PsycINFO databases. English language randomized controlled trials (RCT), feasibility and acceptability studies, pilot studies, and published protocols were included. RESULTS: There is significant evidence that digital interventions can effectively reduce cannabis use in general, non-clinical populations. However, there is less literature examining interventions for persons living with co-occurring psychiatric illness-most of which is tailored to patients living with chronic psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is great need for accessible and tailored digital interventions for co-occurring CUD and psychiatric disorders.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy is an effective treatment for spasticity and dystonia in children with cerebral palsy (CP). However, ITB pump surgery is associated with one of the highest rates of surgical site infection (SSI) in medicine, leading to significant morbidity and expense. Surgical protocols have reduced the rate of SSI in children with other CNS implants, and single-center protocols have been effective in ITB surgery in pediatrics. The authors describe the first multicenter quality improvement (QI)-driven standardized protocol for ITB pump surgery in children with CP across the Cerebral Palsy Research Network (CPRN), implemented with the aim of reducing ITB-associated SSI. METHODS: SSI was defined as a culture-positive infection, ITB pump system removal for suspected infection, or wound dehiscence with exposed hardware. Each center reported historical infection rates for at least 3 years before initiating the SSI protocol (preintervention phase). After initiation of a 13-step surgical protocol, a consecutive series of 130 patients undergoing 149 surgical procedures for ITB at four CPRN tertiary pediatric neurosurgery centers were prospectively enrolled at surgery during a 2-year study period (intervention phase). QI methodology was used, including development of a key driver diagram and tracking performance using run and control charts. The primary process measure goal was documented compliance with 80% of the protocol steps, and the primary outcome measure goal was a 20% reduction in 90-day infection rate. Patient characteristics were collected from the CPRN Research Electronic Data Capture registry, including age at surgery, BMI, Gross Motor Function Classification System level, and pattern of spasticity. RESULTS: The aggregated preintervention 90-day ITB SSI rate was 4.9% (223 procedures) between 2014 and 2017. During the intervention phase, 136 of 149 ITB surgeries performed met inclusion criteria for analysis. The mean documented compliance rate with protocol steps was 75%, and the 90-day infection rate was 4.4%, with an average of 42 days from index surgery to infection. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first multicenter QI initiative designed to reduce SSI in ITB surgery in children with CP. Ongoing enrollment and expansion of the protocol to other CPRN centers will facilitate identification of patient- and procedure-specific risk factors for SSI, and iterative plan-do-study-act cycles incorporating these data will further decrease the risk of SSI for ITB surgery in children.",

Its effectiveness was demonstrated in a pivotal clinical trial where the overall response rate (ORR) reached 60%. Other clinical studies are currently ongoing to investigate the association of the bispecific antibody with novel drugs with encouraging preliminary results, especially in the setting of heavily pretreated patients. In this review, the authors will provide a comprehensive overview of the drug, including its mechanism of action, major clinical trials, and future perspectives.",

        "abstract": "A substantial body of research points to several variables relevant to the etiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD), notably childhood physical and sexual abuse, childhood family environment, and familial aggregation of both internalizing and externalizing disorders. However, these variables tend to be correlated, and few studies have examined them simultaneously. A national sample of randomly selected psychologists and psychiatrists described 524 adult patients with personality disorders. Family environment, parental psychopathology, and history of abuse all independently predicted BPD symptoms in multiple regression analyses. Sexual abuse contributed to the prediction of BPD symptoms over and above family environment, although family environmental factors such as instability partially mediated the effect. The results converge with recent studies using very different samples and methodologies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Geniospasm is a rare genetic disorder characterized by paroxysmal rhythmic or irregular movements of the chin and lower lip due to repetitive contractions of the mentalis muscle. Pathophysiology is poorly understood, and optimal treatment has not been established. METHODS: Geniospasm was characterized in a series of patients after evaluation in our clinics, and a comprehensive review of all cases in the medical literature was performed. RESULTS: We evaluated four patients (1 female) in four families with geniospasm, aged 4 months to 9 years. Bothersome symptoms were present in one patient, who was treated with regular injections of onabotulinumtoxinA, with complete resolution of symptoms and no adverse effects. 9 patients in the literature have had similar outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Limited data exist with regard to the effective treatment of geniospasm. Several treatments have been used historically, with variable outcomes. Our results, together with those of prior reported cases, demonstrate benefit of the use of botulinum toxin injections for management of this condition.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stem cell therapy is a promising treatment for cerebral palsy, which refers to a category of brain diseases that are associated with chronic motor disability in children. Autologous bone marrow stem cells may be a better cell source and have been studied for the treatment of cerebral palsy because of their functions in tissue repair and the regulation of immunological processes. METHODS: To assess autologous marrow stem cells as a novel treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe cerebral palsy, a total of 10 cerebral palsy patients were enrolled in this clinical study with 24 months follow-up. A total of 10 cerebral palsy patients received autologous bone marrow cells transplantation (4.5 \u00d7 10 RESULTS: We recorded the gross motor function measurement scores, manual ability function measurement score, and adverse events up to 24 months post-treatment. The gross motor function measurement scores were significantly higher at month 6 post-treatment compared with the baseline scores and were stable up to 24 months follow-up. The increase in manual ability and communication function measurement scores at 6 months were not significant when compared to the baseline score. All the 10 patients survived and none of the patients experienced any serious adverse events or complications. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that bone marrow derived MNCs are safe and effective for the treatment of motor deficits related to cerebral palsy. Further randomized clinical trials are necessary to establish the efficacy of this procedure.",

        "abstract": "Hypocortisolism is a frequent finding in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) with other research findings implying potential dysregulation of glucocorticoid signaling. Glucocorticoid signaling is under the influence of several pathways, several of which are of interest in the study of CFS. Oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant capacity are known to disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Epel et al., 2004) and the presence of histone deacetylases (HDAC) could also impact glucocorticoid signaling. The intent of this pilot study was to investigate the relationship among oxidative stress elements, select HDAC's (2/3) and glucocorticoid receptor signaling in an elderly sample with CFS. Findings suggest increased histone deacetylase activity, lower total antioxidant power, in the context of decreased plasma cortisol and increased plasma dehydroepiandrosterone concomitant with decreased expression of the encoding gene for the glucocorticoid receptor. These findings support the presence of HPA axis dysregulation in elderly individuals with CFS.",

        "abstract": "B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a member of the tumor necrosis factor family of receptors, is predominantly expressed on the surface of terminally differentiated B cells. BCMA is highly expressed on plasmablasts and plasma cells from multiple myeloma (MM) patient samples. We developed a BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody (teclistamab [JNJ-64007957]) to recruit and activate T cells to kill BCMA-expressing MM cells. Teclistamab induced cytotoxicity of BCMA+ MM cell lines in vitro (H929 cells, 50% effective concentration [EC50] = 0.15 nM; MM.1R cells, EC50 = 0.06 nM; RPMI 8226 cells, EC50 = 0.45 nM) with concomitant T-cell activation (H929 cells, EC50 = 0.21 nM; MM.1R cells, EC50 = 0.1 nM; RPMI 8226 cells, EC50 = 0.28 nM) and cytokine release. This activity was further increased in the presence of a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor (LY-411575). Teclistamab also depleted BCMA+ cells in bone marrow samples from MM patients in an ex vivo assay with an average EC50 value of 1.7 nM. Under more physiological conditions using healthy human whole blood, teclistamab mediated dose-dependent lysis of H929 cells and activation of T cells. Antitumor activity of teclistamab was also observed in 2 BCMA+ MM murine xenograft models inoculated with human T cells (tumor inhibition with H929 model and tumor regression with the RPMI 8226 model) compared with vehicle and antibody controls. The specific and potent activity of teclistamab against BCMA-expressing cells from MM cell lines, patient samples, and MM xenograft models warrant further evaluation of this bispecific antibody for the treatment of MM. Phase 1 clinical trials (monotherapy, #NCT03145181; combination therapy, #NCT04108195) are ongoing for patients with relapsed/refractory MM.",

METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cannabis use has been the most commonly used illicit psychoactive substance in India. Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.",

        "abstract": "Hereditary amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) encompasses a group of genetic disorders characterized by adult-onset loss of the lower and upper motor neuron systems, often with involvement of other parts of the nervous system. Cases of hereditary ALS have been attributed to mutations in 12 different genes, the most common being SOD1, FUS and TARDBP-mutations in the other genes are rare. The identified genes explain 25-35% of cases of familial ALS, but identifying the remaining genes has proved difficult. Only a few genes seem to account for significant numbers of ALS cases, with many others causing a few cases each. Hereditary ALS can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked manner, and families with low disease penetrance are frequently observed. In such families, the genetic predisposition may remain unnoticed, so many patients carry a diagnosis of isolated or sporadic ALS. The only clinical feature that distinguishes recognized hereditary from apparently sporadic ALS is a lower mean age of onset in the former. All the clinical features reported in hereditary cases (including signs of extrapyramidal, cerebellar or cognitive involvement) have also been observed in sporadic cases. Genetic counseling and risk assessment in relatives depend on establishing the specific gene defect and the disease penetrance in the particular family.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) uses the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to grade organ dysfunction in adult patients with suspected infection. However, the SOFA score is not adjusted for age and therefore not suitable for children. OBJECTIVES: To adapt and validate a pediatric version of the SOFA score (pSOFA) in critically ill children and to evaluate the Sepsis-3 definitions in patients with confirmed or suspected infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective observational cohort study included all critically ill children 21 years or younger admitted to a 20-bed, multidisciplinary, tertiary pediatric intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and August 1, 2016. Data on these children were obtained from an electronic health record database. The pSOFA score was developed by adapting the original SOFA score with age-adjusted cutoffs for the cardiovascular and renal systems and by expanding the respiratory criteria to include noninvasive surrogates of lung injury. Daily pSOFA scores were calculated from admission until day 28 of hospitalization, discharge, or death (whichever came first). Three additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were calculated for comparison. EXPOSURES: Organ dysfunction measured by the pSOFA score, and sepsis and septic shock according to the Sepsis-3 definitions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The daily pSOFA scores and additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were compared. Performance was evaluated using the area under the curve. The pSOFA score was then used to assess the Sepsis-3 definitions in the subgroup of children with confirmed or suspected infection. RESULTS: In all, 6303 patients with 8711 encounters met inclusion criteria. Each encounter was treated independently. Of the 8482 survivors of hospital encounters, 4644 (54.7%) were male and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 69 (17-156) months. Among the 229 nonsurvivors, 127 (55.4%) were male with a median (IQR) age of 43 (8-144) months. In-hospital mortality was 2.6%. The maximum pSOFA score had excellent discrimination for in-hospital mortality, with an area under the curve of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92-0.95). The pSOFA score had a similar or better performance than other pediatric organ dysfunction scores. According to the Sepsis-3 definitions, 1231 patients (14.1%) were classified as having sepsis and had a mortality rate of 12.1%, and 347 (4.0%) had septic shock and a mortality rate of 32.3%. Patients with sepsis were more likely to die than patients with confirmed or suspected infection but no sepsis (odds ratio, 18; 95% CI, 11-28). Of the 229 patients who died during their hospitalization, 149 (65.0%) had sepsis or septic shock during their course. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The pSOFA score was adapted and validated with age-adjusted variables in critically ill children. Using the pSOFA score, the Sepsis-3 definitions were assessed in children with confirmed or suspected infection. This study is the first assessment, to date, of the Sepsis-3 definitions in critically ill children. Use of these definitions in children is feasible and shows promising results.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The accumulation of soluble and insoluble aggregated amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) may initiate or potentiate pathologic processes in Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to A\u03b2 soluble protofibrils, is being tested in persons with early Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We conducted an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial involving persons 50 to 90 years of age with early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) with evidence of amyloid on positron-emission tomography (PET) or by cerebrospinal fluid testing. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous lecanemab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline at 18 months in the score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). Key secondary end points were the change in amyloid burden on PET, the score on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90; higher scores indicate greater impairment), the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS; range, 0 to 1.97; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL; range, 0 to 53; lower scores indicate greater impairment). RESULTS: A total of 1795 participants were enrolled, with 898 assigned to receive lecanemab and 897 to receive placebo. The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, -0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.23; P<0.001). In a substudy involving 698 participants, there were greater reductions in brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo (difference, -59.1 centiloids; 95% CI, -62.6 to -55.6). Other mean differences between the two groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14 score, -1.44 (95% CI, -2.27 to -0.61; P<0.001); for the ADCOMS, -0.050 (95% CI, -0.074 to -0.027; P<0.001); and for the ADCS-MCI-ADL score, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001). Lecanemab resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions in 12.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Lecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events. Longer trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease. (Funded by Eisai and Biogen; Clarity AD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03887455.).",

        "abstract": "Experimental evidence supporting 1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium [paraquat (PQ)] as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) is equivocal. Other agricultural chemicals, including dithiocarbamate fungicides such as manganese ethylenebisdithiocarbamate [maneb (MB)], are widely used in the same geographical regions as paraquat and also impact dopamine systems, suggesting that mixtures may be more relevant etiological models. This study therefore proposed that combined PQ and MB exposures would produce greater effects on dopamine (DA) systems than would either compound administered alone. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated twice a week for 6 weeks with intraperitoneal saline, 10 mg/kg paraquat, 30 mg/kg maneb, or their combination (PQ + MB). MB, but not PQ, reduced motor activity immediately after treatment, and this effect was potentiated by combined PQ + MB treatment. As treatments progressed, only the combined PQ + MB group evidenced a failure of motor activity levels to recover within 24 hr. Striatal DA and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid increased 1-3 d and decreased 7 d after injections. Only PQ + MB reduced tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and DA transporter immunoreactivity and did so in dorsal striatum but not nucleus accumbens. Correspondingly, striatal TH protein levels were decreased only by combined PQ + MB 5 d after injection. Reactive gliosis occurred only in response to combined PQ + MB in dorsal-medial but not ventral striatum. TH immunoreactivity and cell counts were reduced only by PQ + MB and in the substantia nigra but not ventral tegmental area. These synergistic effects of combined PQ + MB, preferentially expressed in the nigrostriatal DA system, suggest that such mixtures could play a role in the etiology of PD.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can be caused by a broad range of pathogens; however, bacterial infections represent the majority of sepsis cases. Up to 42% of sepsis presentations are culture negative, suggesting a non-bacterial cause. Despite this, diagnosis of viral sepsis remains very rare. Almost any virus can cause sepsis in vulnerable patients (e.g., neonates, infants, and other immunosuppressed groups). The prevalence of viral sepsis is not known, nor is there enough information to make an accurate estimate. The initial standard of care for all cases of sepsis, even those that are subsequently proven to be culture negative, is the immediate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the absence of definite diagnostic criteria for viral sepsis, or at least to exclude bacterial sepsis, this inevitably leads to unnecessary antimicrobial use, with associated consequences for antimicrobial resistance, effects on the host microbiome and excess healthcare costs. It is important to understand non-bacterial causes of sepsis so that inappropriate treatment can be minimised, and appropriate treatments can be developed to improve outcomes. In this review, we summarise what is known about viral sepsis, its most common causes, and how the immune responses to severe viral infections can contribute to sepsis. We also discuss strategies to improve our understanding of viral sepsis, and ways we can integrate this new information into effective treatment.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug with unique efficacy, and it is the only recommended treatment for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS: failure to respond to at least two different antipsychotics). However, clozapine is also associated with a range of adverse effects which restrict its use, including blood dyscrasias, for which haematological monitoring is required. As treatment resistance is recognised earlier in the illness, the question of whether clozapine should be prescribed in children and young people is increasingly important. However, most research to date has been in older, chronic patients, and evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of clozapine in people under age 25 is lacking. The CLEAR (CLozapine in EARly psychosis) trial will assess whether clozapine is more effective than treatment as usual (TAU), at the level of clinical symptoms, patient rated outcomes, quality of life and cost-effectiveness in people below 25\u00a0years of age. Additionally, a nested biomarker study will investigate the mechanisms of action of clozapine compared to TAU. METHODS AND DESIGN: This is the protocol of a multi-centre, open label, blind-rated, randomised controlled effectiveness trial of clozapine vs TAU (any other oral antipsychotic monotherapy licenced in the British National Formulary) for 12\u00a0weeks in 260 children and young people with TRS (12-24\u00a0years old). AIM AND OBJECTIVES: The primary outcome is the change in blind-rated Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores at 12\u00a0weeks from baseline. Secondary outcomes include blind-rated Clinical Global Impression, patient-rated outcomes, quality of life, adverse effects, and treatment adherence. Patients will be followed up for 12\u00a0months and will be invited to give consent for longer term follow-up using clinical records and potential re-contact for further research. For mechanism of action, change in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers and peripheral inflammatory markers will be measured over 12\u00a0weeks. DISCUSSION: The CLEAR trial will contribute knowledge on clozapine effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness compared to standard antipsychotics in young people with TRS, and the results may guide future clinical treatment recommendation for early psychosis.

BACKGROUND: Being the most common cause of children's death, sepsis is a challenge for most physicians. In order to improve the outcomes, it is important to know the aetiology and peculiarities of sepsis in a particular region and hospital. The aim of this study was to analyse the outcomes of sepsis in a paediatric intensive care unit and their relation with patients' characteristics and causative microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Sepsis Registration System in Vilnius University Children's hospital was started in 2012. From 2012 to 2015, we found 529 sepsis cases in our hospital, 203 of which were found to be fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria (patient's age >28 days on admission, taken blood culture/positive PCR test, need for paediatric ICU hospitalization) and were included in the final analysis. Abbreviations: ICD - international disease classification PCR - polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Sepsis made 4% of all patients of the paediatric ICU in the period from 2012 to 2015 and caused 32% of deaths in the unit. Paediatric mortality reached 14% of all sepsis cases in our analysis, the majority of them due to hospital-acquired sepsis that occurred in patients suffering from oncologic or hematologic diseases. Another significant part of the patients that did not survive were previously healthy with no co-morbidities.

Lecanemab is a humanized anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody directed towards A\u03b2 protofibrils. Lecanemab is the only drug that targets A\u03b2 soluble protofibrils and has shown statistical differences in mild AD or mild cognitive impairment. In its landmark phase III trial, lecanemab was shown to slow the progression of clinical decline, and a reduction in amyloid protein accumulation. The difference in mean CDR-SOB score improvement between the treatment and placebo groups was -0.45, of which the clinical significance could be argued. Amyloid burden was also considerably reduced as well, but the true clinical consequence of this reduction remains to be seen. This beneficial impact on daily living is offset by rare but serious side effects including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) causing cerebral edema (ARIA-E) or cerebral microhemorrhages or hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H). Benefits of therapy must be considered against the risk of cerebral microhemorrhages and edema. Affordability must also be taken into consideration. The current estimated yearly cost for twice monthly lecanemab infusion is $26,500. In addition to the significant cost challenges, the frequent infusions may pose concerns related to access. Additional agents within this class are in the pipelines with possibly increased efficacy or decreased adverse events.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease, is the main cause of dementia and one of the leading causes of death for elderly people in the USA. Lecanemab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid protofibrils for the treatment of early AD [i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD dementia]. In a recent 18-month phase\u00a0III trial, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, lecanemab treatment led to reduced brain amyloid burden and significant improvements in cognitive and functional abilities in individuals with early AD. METHODS: An evidence-based patient-level disease simulation model was updated to estimate the long-term health outcomes of lecanemab plus standard of care (SoC) compared to SoC alone in patients with early AD and evidence of brain amyloid burden, using recent phase\u00a0III trial data and published literature. The disease progression is described by changes in the underlying biomarkers of AD, including measures of amyloid and tau, and their connection to the clinical presentation of the disease assessed through various patient-level scales of cognition and function. RESULTS: Lecanemab treatment was estimated to slow the progression of AD to moderate and severe stages and reduce the time spent in these more advanced states. In individuals with early AD, lecanemab plus SoC was associated with a gain of 0.71 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), a 2.95-year delay in mean time to progression to AD dementia, a reduction of 0.11\u00a0years in institutional care, and an additional 1.07\u00a0years in community care as shown in the base-case study. Improved health outcomes were demonstrated with lecanemab treatment when initiated earlier based on age, disease severity, or tau pathology, resulting in estimated gains in QALYs ranging from 0.77 to 1.09\u00a0years, compared to 0.4\u00a0years in the mild AD dementia subset, as shown by the model. CONCLUSION: The study findings demonstrate the potential clinical value of lecanemab for individuals with early AD by slowing down disease progression and prolonging time in earlier stages of disease, which significantly benefits not only patients and caregivers but also society overall.

        "abstract": "Early detection of dementia is recommended in the stages from mild cognitive impairment to early dementia, excluding the asymptomatic stage. The advantages of early detection for patients and their caregivers include early receipt of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies, and early access to appropriate agencies and/or support networks. The disadvantages include psychological damage related to anxiety and depression, and risk of stigmatization and/or social exclusion. The possibility of false positive diagnoses is also problematic. For detection of dementia, various screening tests and questionnaires have been developed. However, none of these techniques are sensitive and specific enough to avoid false positives. Thus, these screening tools are recommended for assessment of the severity of functional decline after sufficient information has been gathered to suspect dementia. In terms of social services, early detection might delay institutionalization. However, implementation of early detection would add a heavy burden on social resources, especially human resources. For effective implementation of early diagnosis and management of dementia, measures are required to improve social and human resources, including the following: improvement of the diagnostic abilities of general practitioners, improvement of necessary care and support systems after diagnosis, and organizing volunteers to support local communities. Under a community-based integrated care system, each community will create a \"tailored\" system that meets the health needs, health status and values of the community. Promoting social participation and community involvement of the residents should be one of the key strategies to address the shortage of human resources.",

According to the latest reports of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC), the percentages of deliveries per ART cycle in 2014 and 2016 were 21 and 22%, respectively. Among the reasons for this relatively low efficiency, the quality of the spermatozoa has been pointed out as critical, and the presence of high percentages of DNA-damaged spermatozoa in patients' ejaculates is possibly one of the main factors reducing the ARTs outcomes.

        "abstract": "Exposure to pyrethroids, a significant class of the most widely used agricultural chemicals, has been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, although many different pyrethroids induce roughly the same symptoms of Parkinsonism, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To find the shared key features among these mechanisms, we focused on 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common and prominent metabolite of most pyrethroids produced via hydrolysis by CEs in mammals. To determine the contribution of 3-PBA to the initiation and progression of PD, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively, and found that 3-PBA not only accumulates in murine brain tissues over time but also further induces PD-like pathologies (increased \u03b1-syn and phospho-S129, decreased TH) to the same or even greater extent than the precursor pyrethroid. A before-after study of PET-DAT in the same mice revealed that low concentrations of 3-PBA (0.5 mg/kg) could paradoxically cause DAT to increase (22.46% higher than pre-drug test). The intervention of DAT inhibitors and activators respectively alleviated and enhanced the dopaminergic toxicity of 3-PBA, indicating that 3-PBA interacts with DAT. In particular, low concentrations of 3-PBA increase the DAT, which in turn induces 3-PBA to enter the dopaminergic neurons to exert toxic effects. Finally, we described a mechanism underlying this potential role of 3-PBA in the pathological aggregation of \u03b1-syn. Specifically, 3-PBA was found to dysregulate C/EBP \u03b2 levels and further anomalously activate AEP in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by increased accumulation of pathologically cleaved \u03b1-syn (N103 fragments) and accelerated \u03b1-syn aggregation. All these results suggest that 3-PBA exposure could mimic the pathological and pathogenetic features of PD, showing that this metabolite is a key pathogenic compound in pyrethroid-related pathological effects and a possible dopamine neurotoxin. Additionally, our findings provide a crucial reference for the primary prevention of PD.",

METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "abstract": "(1) Background: Endometriosis is a widespread gynecological condition that causes chronic pelvic discomfort, dysmenorrhea, infertility, and impaired quality of life in women of reproductive age. Clinical examination, transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are significant preoperative non-invasive diagnosis procedures for the accurate assessment of endometriosis. Although TVS is used as the primary line for diagnosis, MRI is commonly utilized to achieve a better anatomical overview of the entire pelvic organs. The aim of this systematic review article is to thoroughly summarize the research on various endometriosis diagnosis methods that are less invasive. (2) Methods: To find relevant studies, we examined electronic databases, such as MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar, choosing 70 papers as references. (3) Results: The findings indicate that various approaches can contribute to diagnosis in different ways, depending on the type of endometriosis. For patients suspected of having deep pelvic endometriosis, transvaginal sonography should be the first line of diagnosis. Endometriosis cysts are better diagnosed with TVS, whereas torus, uterosacral ligaments, intestine, and bladder endometriosis lesions are best diagnosed using MRI. When it comes to detecting intestine or rectal nodules, as well as rectovaginal septum nodules, MRI should be the imaging tool of choice. (4) Conclusions: When diagnosing DE (deep infiltrative endometriosis), the examiner's experience is the most important criterion to consider. In the diagnosis of endometriosis, expert-guided TVS is more accurate than routine pelvic ultrasound, especially in the deep infiltrative form. For optimal treatment and surgical planning, accurate preoperative deep infiltrative endometriosis diagnosis is essential, especially because it requires a multidisciplinary approach.",

        "title": "Bulevirtide in the Treatment of Hepatitis Delta: Drug Discovery, Clinical Development and Place in Therapy.",
        "abstract": "It has been ten years since the identification of NTCP as the cell surface receptor for HBV and HDV entry into hepatocytes. The search for molecules interfering with the binding of NTCP and HBV/HDV led to design bulevirtide (BLV). This large polypeptide mimics a region of the pre-S1 HBsAg and blocks viral entry by inhibitory competition. BLV was initially tested in cell cultures, animal models and more recently in Phase I-III human trials (called 'MYRS'). As monotherapy or in combination with peginterferon, BLV is well tolerated and exhibits potent antiviral activity. Plasma viremia significantly declines and/or becomes undetectable in more than 75% of patients treated for >24 weeks. However, serum HBsAg concentrations remain unchanged. No selection of BLV resistance in HBV/HDV has been reported in vivo to date. BLV is administered subcutaneously once daily at doses between 2 and 10 mg. BLV received conditional approval in Europe in 2020 to treat chronic hepatitis delta. The advent of peginterferon lambda or new specific anti-HDV antivirals (lonafarnib, etc.) will open the door for combination therapies with BLV. Since there is no stable reservoir for HDV-RNA within infected hepatocytes, viral clearance might be achieved using antivirals for a minimum timeframe. This is what happens in hepatitis C combining several antivirals, curing nearly all patients treated for 3 months. Clearance of HDV-RNA genomes may occur despite HBV persistence as cccDNA or chromosome integrated HBV-DNA within hepatocytes. This is supported by cases of HDV elimination using BLV despite persistence of serum HBsAg. Another path for HDV cure will derive from achieving HBsAg clearance, the goal of new promising anti-HBV gene therapies (bepirovirsen, etc.). In summary, the advent of BLV has triggered a renovated interest for antiviral therapy in hepatitis delta. We envision combination therapies that will lead to HDV cure in the near future.",

In HBV-transgenic mice treated at 50 mg/kg/wk, hepatic HBV RNA and DNA were reduced by 90% and 99%, respectively. Subsequently, a phase 1 first-in-human study assessed pharmacokinetics and tolerability of single (75-450 mg) and multiple (150-450 mg on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 22) subcutaneous bepirovirsen doses in 96 healthy volunteers. Bepirovirsen at all dose levels was rapidly absorbed (maximum plasma concentration 3-8 hours after dosing), rapidly distributed to peripheral tissues, and slowly eliminated (median plasma terminal half-life: 22.5-24.6 days across cohorts). Plasma exposure (dose-proportional at 150-450 mg) and concentration-time profiles were similar following the first and sixth doses, suggesting little to no plasma accumulation (steady state achieved by day 22). Renal elimination of full-length bepirovirsen accounted for <2% of the total dose. Across the single and multiple dose cohorts, 197 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported, with 99% and 65% classified as mild in severity and local injection site reactions, respectively. In conclusion, bepirovirsen showed an acceptable safety profile in humans with observed pharmacokinetics consistent with the chemical class, warranting further evaluation of bepirovirsen in chronic HBV infection.",

        "title": "Epidemiology of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis in children in Switzerland: a population-based cohort study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. We assessed population-based incidence and outcomes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis in children in Switzerland. METHODS: We did a multicentre, prospective, cohort study at ten paediatric hospitals in Switzerland. We included neonates and children younger than 17 years with blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis. Children were eligible if they met criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome-according to 2005 paediatric consensus definition- at the time of blood culture sampling. Incidence was calculated by dividing the number of annual sepsis episodes in the study for the years 2012-15 by the end-of-year resident paediatric population in Switzerland. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in the first 30 days after sepsis onset. FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2011, and Dec 31, 2015, we enrolled 1096 children to our study. Of 1181 episodes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis, 382 (32%) occurred in 379 previously healthy children, 402 (34%) in 391 neonates, and 397 (34%) in 341 children with comorbidities. Incidence was 25\u00b71 cases per 100\u2008000 (95% CI 23\u00b78-26\u00b74) in children and 146\u00b70 cases per 100\u2008000 (133\u00b72-159\u00b76) in neonates. Central line-associated bloodstream infections and primary bloodstream infections accounted for 569 (48%) of 1181 episodes, and organ dysfunction was present in 455 (39%) of 1181 episodes. Escherichia coli (242 of 1181 [20%]), Staphylococcus aureus (177 of 1181 [15%]), coagulase-negative staphylococci (135 of 1181 [11%]), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (118 of 1181 [10%]) were the most prevalent pathogens in our study, accounting for 57% of episodes. The overall case-fatality ratio was 7% (82 of 1181 episodes; 95% CI 5\u00b76-8\u00b76), and it was higher in neonates (11%, 45 of 402 episodes; 8\u00b74-14\u00b78; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 4\u00b741, 95% CI 1\u00b775-11\u00b71) and children with comorbidities (7%, 27 of 397 episodes; 4\u00b76-9\u00b79; OR 4\u00b797, 1\u00b784-13\u00b74) compared with previously healthy children (3%, ten of 382 episodes; 1\u00b73-4\u00b79). The case-fatality ratio was 1% (five of 726 episodes [95% CI 0\u00b73-1\u00b77]) for children without organ dysfunction, which increased to 17% (77 of 455 episodes [13\u00b77-20\u00b78]) when organ dysfunction was present (adjusted OR 4\u00b784, 95% CI 1\u00b740-16\u00b77). INTERPRETATION: The burden of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis on child health remains considerable. We recorded key differences in predominant organisms, severity, and outcome between neonates, previously healthy children, and children with comorbidities. Although for most episodes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis, no organ dysfunction was seen, presence of organ dysfunction was strongly associated with mortality.

Body dissatisfaction or body dysmorphia in men may be more related to a drive for muscularity as opposed to thinness. Muscle dysmorphic disorder (also known as muscle dysmorphia) is a form or subtype of body dysmorphia that is characterised by an extreme desire for muscularity and a preoccupation with the idea that one's physique is too small or not sufficiently muscular. It is more common in men than women and is associated with body image distortion, excessive exercise routines, muscularity-orientated disordered eating and the use of appearance- and performance-enhancing drugs such as anabolic androgenic steroids. Risk factors for muscle dysmorphic disorder include social pressure (including to conform to gender stereotypes) and low self-esteem. The condition has negative psychological, physical, relational and financial effects.

Recent epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that exposure to environmental agents, including a number of agricultural chemicals, may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Animal models are important tools in experimental medical science for studying the pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention strategies of human diseases. Since many human disorders do not arise spontaneously in animals, characteristic functional changes have to be mimicked by neurotoxic agents. Recently, agricultural chemicals, when administrated systemically, have been shown to reproduce specific features of PD in rodents, thus opening new routes for the development of animal models for this disorder. In addition to a brief historical overview of the toxin-induced PD models, this study provides a detailed description of exiting models in which Parkinsonism is initiated via the exposure of animals to such agricultural chemicals as rotenone, paraquat, and maneb. Suggested neurotoxicity mechanisms of these chemicals are considered, and the major lessons learned from the analysis of pesticide-induced PD models are discussed.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Sexual minority women and gender diverse individuals assigned female at birth (SMWGD) are at elevated risk for alcohol and cannabis use disorders. It has been posited that characteristics of SMWGD's substance use companions (i.e., sexual orientation, gender identity) may influence their own use, but few studies have tested this. The current study aimed to examine whether quantity and consequences of substance use varied based on sexual orientations and gender identities (SOGI) of SMWGD's substance use companions. METHODS: We utilized a 30-day ecological momentary assessment study of substance use among a sample of 429 SMWGD. We examined event-level associations between characteristics of substance use companions and quantity and consequences of substance use. RESULTS: When SMWGD used alcohol/cannabis with most SOGI groups, they engaged in heavier drinking and cannabis use. Drinking with heterosexual men and SMW was associated with more drinking consequences. Drinking in settings with more SOGI groups and with both LGBTQ+ and heterosexual individuals was associated with heavier drinking and more consequences. Many contextual aspects of cannabis use settings predicted an increased likelihood of alcohol and cannabis co-use, while few contextual aspects of drinking settings were associated with co-use. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that SMWGD engage in heavier substance use when individuals from a range of SOGI groups are present, highlighting that heavy alcohol and cannabis use is not limited to use with SMW and nonbinary individuals. Drinking in setting with more SOGI groups present (e.g., parties and bars) appears to be associated with particularly heavy drinking and consequences.",

However, associations between adolescent cannabis use, depression and anxiety disorders are inconsistently reported in longitudinal samples. AIMS: To study associations of adolescent cannabis use with depression and anxiety disorders. METHOD: We used data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986, linked to nationwide registers, to study the association between adolescent cannabis use and depression and anxiety disorders until 33 years of age (until 2018). RESULTS: We included 6325 participants (48.8% male) in the analyses; 352 (5.6%) participants reported cannabis use until 15-16 years of age. By the end of the follow-up, 583 (9.2%) participants were diagnosed with unipolar depression and 688 (10.9%) were diagnosed with anxiety disorder. Cannabis use in adolescence was associated with an increased risk of depression and anxiety disorders in crude models. After adjusting for parental psychiatric disorder, baseline emotional and behavioural problems, demographic factors and other substance use, using cannabis five or more times was associated with increased risk of anxiety disorders (hazard ratio 2.01, 95% CI 1.15-3.82), and using cannabis once (hazard ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.30-2.87) or two to four times (hazard ratio 2.02, 95% CI 1.24-3.31) was associated with increased risk of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in adolescence was associated with an increased risk of future depression and anxiety disorders. Further research is needed to clarify if this is a causal association, which could then inform public health messages about the use of cannabis in adolescence.",

        "title": "Phoenix criteria for sepsis: are these enough to guide a clinician?",
        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. There is a paucity of data on the criteria used to define sepsis and septic shock and predict mortality. Schlapbach et al. published Phoenix criteria to define sepsis in JAMA in 2024. Previously, paediatricians have used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, but these criteria lack sensitivity and specificity. This group recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Though included in the 8-point criteria, important criteria like renal and liver are missing from the main criteria. We remain worried about the way these criteria got excluded from the main criteria. Therefore, in this brief report, whilst commending the authors for this stelar task, we highlight the main pitfalls in these criteria especially the renal, neurologic, and liver criteria. These criteria have been shown to be independently associated with outcomes, and we recommend that in the future iterations of the criteria, renal and liver criteria should be defined according to latest definitions and the task force consider utilizing latest criteria for each organ system involved within the formulated criteria. CONCLUSION: \u00a0In conclusion, Phoenix criteria are a step in the right direction to define life-threatening organ dysfunction in sepsis, but clinicians need to be mindful that diagnosis/treatment of less severe sepsis should not be delayed if these criteria are not met. Therefore, local early detection and management tools for sepsis should be followed. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 There has always been a quest for a definition for pediatric sepsis. There are limitations to the previous pediatric sepsis criteria which were published in 2005 by the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC). IPSCC defines sepsis as a suspected or confirmed infection in the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). These new Phoenix Pediatric Sepsis (PPS) criteria for sepsis and septic shock are intended to identify children with life-threatening organ dysfunction due to infection, and the score was developed based on a very large pediatric dataset. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022 Though the intention of Phoenix criteria is to help identify children with life threatening organ dysfunction, unfortunately the crietria will miss signs of early sepis. In this manuscript, we point out some of the drawbacks of these criteria which need to be borne in mind while applying these criteria.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The involvement of B-cells in multiple sclerosis has only recently emerged. Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the B-cell antigen CD20 with enhanced B-cell targeting. AREAS COVERED: This evaluation is of the identical ULTIMATE (UbLiTuximab In Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Effects) I and II trials comparing ublituximab (TG-1101) and teriflunomide in relapsing multiple sclerosis. The primary efficacy end point was the annualized relapse rate and was lower in the ublituximab than the teriflunomide group. EXPERT OPINION: The continuation rates to oral teriflunomide in ULTIMATE were higher than in other trials, possibly because of the supervised double-dummy protocol used with intravenous ublituximab. This may have contributed to the higher efficacy with teriflunomide in this trial than previously reported. Nevertheless, ublituximab was more effective than teriflunomide at reducing the annualized relapse rates and MRI endpoints, but not for no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the ULTIMATE trials did show that ublituximab was superior to teriflunomide in NEDA. Long-term studies of the adverse effects of ublituximab are required. Despite the positive results from ULTIMATE for ublituximab, it is still under the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and conclusions should await their findings.",

However, treatment of CLL patients with high-risk cytogenetics features remains a challenge and the outcome of these hard-to-treat patients is dismal. At the 2017 ASCO Meeting, results of the GENUINE phase III trial showed that, by adding ublituximab, a glycoengineered, anti-CD20 type 1 monoclonal antibody, to ibrutinib, the overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CRR), and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity may be improved in high-risk CLL patients. A further way to improve the results obtained with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors is the parallel use of ibrutinib with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Through this investigational approach, the rate of MRD negativity was shown to be higher, implying potential eradication of CLL. These novel data indicate that ibrutinib continues to have a positive effect in CLL.",

CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in the treatment of R/R childhood B-ALL, although the majority of reports have been in noninfant patients. Barriers to the successful implementation of CAR T-cell therapy in infant B-ALL include challenges related to apheresis, product manufacturing, and disease-specific considerations such as lineage switch. We describe our experience using 2 experimental CD19 CAR T-cell products, SCRI-CAR19 or SCRI-CAR19x22, for 19 patients with R/R infant B-ALL enrolled in 3 clinical trials. CAR T-cell products were successfully manufactured in 18 of 19 (94.7%) patients, with a median age of 22.5\u00a0months at enrollment (range, 14.5-40.1). Of 17 (94.1%) treated patients, 16 achieved a complete remission without detectable minimal residual disease. The 1-year leukemia-free survival was 75%, and 1-year overall survival was 76.5%, with a median follow-up time of 35.8\u00a0months (range, 1.7-83.6). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 14 of 17 (82.4%) patients, with only 1 patient experiencing grade 3 CRS. Neurotoxicity occurred in 2 of 17 (11.8%) patients with all events grade \u22642.

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells represent a breakthrough in personalized medicine. In this strategy, a patient's own T lymphocytes are genetically reprogrammed to encode a synthetic receptor that binds a tumor antigen, allowing T cells to recognize and kill antigen-expressing cancer cells. As a result of complete and durable responses in individuals who are refractory to standard of care therapy, CAR T cells directed against the CD19 protein have been granted United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as a therapy for treatment of pediatric and young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Human trials of CAR T cells targeting CD19 or B cell maturation antigen in multiple myeloma have also reported early successes. However, a clear and consistently reproducible demonstration of the clinical efficacy of CAR T cells in the setting of solid tumors has not been reported to date. Here, we review the history and status of CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors, potential T cell-intrinsic determinants of response and resistance as well as extrinsic obstacles to the success of this approach for much more prevalent non-hematopoietic malignancies. In addition, we summarize recent strategies and innovations that aim to augment the potency of CAR T cells in the face of multiple immunosuppressive barriers operative within the solid tumor microenvironment. Advances in the field of CAR T cell biology over the coming years in the areas of safety, reliability and efficacy against non-hematopoietic cancers will ultimately determine how transformative adoptive T cell therapy will be in the broader battle against cancer.",

It results from mutation in MECP2 gene in the long arm (q) of the X chromosome. OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide is a recently developed drug that has a neuroprotective effect on neurons, and it is our aim in this meta-analysis to evaluate its efficacy and safety in treating Rett syndrome patients. METHODS: We searched 5 databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Trofinetide and placebo in patients with Rett syndrome until August 13, 2023.Our primary outcomes were the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI) and the Rett syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ). We used Risk of Bias Assessment tool-2 (ROB2) to assess the methodological quality of the included randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: Three RCTs with a total of 325 patients were included with a follow-up duration ranging from one month to three months. 186 patients received the intervention drug (Trofinetide) and 138 received the placebo. Trofinetide was found to reduce CGI and RSBQ significantly more than placebo (MD\u2009=\u2009-0.35, 95% CI [-0.52 to -0.18], P 0.0001), (MD\u2009=\u2009-3.40, 95% CI [-3.69 to -3.12], P 0.00001) respectively. Most adverse events did not show any statistical difference between Trofinetide and the placebo. CONCLUSION: Trofinetide offers promise as a potential effective and safe therapeutic opportunity for a population without many available treatments, with improvements seen on both CGI and RSBQ assessments and no severe adverse effects reported.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pediatric sepsis is a complicated condition characterized by life-threatening organ failure resulting from a dysregulated host response to infection in children. It is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, and rapid detection and administration of antimicrobials have been emphasized. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic biomarkers of pediatric sepsis and the function of immune cell infiltration in the development of this illness. METHODS: Three gene expression datasets were available from the Gene Expression Omnibus collection. First, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found with the use of the R program, and then gene set enrichment analysis was carried out. Subsequently, the DEGs were combined with the major module genes chosen using the weighted gene co-expression network. The hub genes were identified by the use of three machine-learning algorithms: random forest, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The receiver operating characteristic curve and nomogram model were used to verify the discrimination and efficacy of the hub genes. In addition, the inflammatory and immune status of pediatric sepsis was assessed using cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT). The relationship between the diagnostic markers and infiltrating immune cells was further studied. RESULTS: Overall, after overlapping key module genes and DEGs, we detected 402 overlapping genes. As pediatric sepsis diagnostic indicators, CYSTM1 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.988), MMP8 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.973), and CD177 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.986) were investigated and demonstrated statistically significant differences (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and diagnostic efficacy in the validation set. As indicated by the immune cell infiltration analysis, multiple immune cells may be involved in the development of pediatric sepsis. Additionally, all diagnostic characteristics may correlate with immune cells to varying degrees. CONCLUSIONS: The candidate hub genes (CD177, CYSTM1, and MMP8) were identified, and the nomogram was constructed for pediatric sepsis diagnosis. Our study could provide potential peripheral blood diagnostic candidate genes for pediatric sepsis patients.",

Mucopolysaccharidosis-Plus Syndrome (MPSPS), an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the endo-lysosomal tethering protein VPS33A, shows additional renal and hematopoietic abnormalities (\"Plus symptoms\") uncommon in conventional MPS. Here, we analyze data from biochemical, histological, and physical examinations-particularly of blood counts and kidney function-to further characterize the clinical phenotype of MPSPS. A series of blood tests indicate hematopoietic symptoms including progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia, which correlate with histological observations of hypoplastic bone marrow. High urinary excretion of protein (caused by impairments in renal filtration), hypoalbuminemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, cholesterol, and uric acid indicate renal dysfunction. Histological analyses of MPSPS kidneys similarly suggest the extensive destruction of glomerular structures by foamy podocytes.

        "abstract": "Almost 50% of the infertility cases are due to male factors. Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) allow to overcome the incapacity of these patients' spermatozoa to fertilize the oocyte and produce a viable and healthy offspring, but the efficiency of the different techniques has still the potential to improve. According to the latest reports of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC), the percentages of deliveries per ART cycle in 2014 and 2016 were 21 and 22%, respectively. Among the reasons for this relatively low efficiency, the quality of the spermatozoa has been pointed out as critical, and the presence of high percentages of DNA-damaged spermatozoa in patients' ejaculates is possibly one of the main factors reducing the ARTs outcomes. Thus, one of the main challenges in reproductive medicine is to ensure the highest quality of the spermatozoa used in ARTs, and specifically, in terms of genetic integrity. The latest techniques for the preparation and selection of human spermatozoa are herein discussed focusing on those proven to improve one or several of the following parameters: sperm genetic integrity, fertilization capacity, embryo production, and ",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Research was carried out at the paediatric intensive care unit (paediatric ICU) of the Children's Hospital, affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santari\u0161ki\u0173 klinikos. BACKGROUND: Being the most common cause of children's death, sepsis is a challenge for most physicians. In order to improve the outcomes, it is important to know the aetiology and peculiarities of sepsis in a particular region and hospital. The aim of this study was to analyse the outcomes of sepsis in a paediatric intensive care unit and their relation with patients' characteristics and causative microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Sepsis Registration System in Vilnius University Children's hospital was started in 2012. From 2012 to 2015, we found 529 sepsis cases in our hospital, 203 of which were found to be fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria (patient's age >28 days on admission, taken blood culture/positive PCR test, need for paediatric ICU hospitalization) and were included in the final analysis. Abbreviations: ICD - international disease classification PCR - polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Sepsis made 4% of all patients of the paediatric ICU in the period from 2012 to 2015 and caused 32% of deaths in the unit. Paediatric mortality reached 14% of all sepsis cases in our analysis, the majority of them due to hospital-acquired sepsis that occurred in patients suffering from oncologic or hematologic diseases. Another significant part of the patients that did not survive were previously healthy with no co-morbidities. The most common microorganism in lethal community-acquired cases was  CONCLUSIONS: A large percentage of lethal outcomes that occur in the paediatric ICU are due to sepsis. The majority of lethal cases of sepsis occur in patients suffering from chronic co-morbidities, such as oncologic, hematologic, neurologic, and others. Santrauka ",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "abstract": "The etiologic basis of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, is unknown. Recent epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that exposure to environmental agents, including a number of agricultural chemicals, may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Animal models are important tools in experimental medical science for studying the pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention strategies of human diseases. Since many human disorders do not arise spontaneously in animals, characteristic functional changes have to be mimicked by neurotoxic agents. Recently, agricultural chemicals, when administrated systemically, have been shown to reproduce specific features of PD in rodents, thus opening new routes for the development of animal models for this disorder. In addition to a brief historical overview of the toxin-induced PD models, this study provides a detailed description of exiting models in which Parkinsonism is initiated via the exposure of animals to such agricultural chemicals as rotenone, paraquat, and maneb. Suggested neurotoxicity mechanisms of these chemicals are considered, and the major lessons learned from the analysis of pesticide-induced PD models are discussed.",

In this strategy, a patient's own T lymphocytes are genetically reprogrammed to encode a synthetic receptor that binds a tumor antigen, allowing T cells to recognize and kill antigen-expressing cancer cells. As a result of complete and durable responses in individuals who are refractory to standard of care therapy, CAR T cells directed against the CD19 protein have been granted United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as a therapy for treatment of pediatric and young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Human trials of CAR T cells targeting CD19 or B cell maturation antigen in multiple myeloma have also reported early successes. However, a clear and consistently reproducible demonstration of the clinical efficacy of CAR T cells in the setting of solid tumors has not been reported to date. Here, we review the history and status of CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors, potential T cell-intrinsic determinants of response and resistance as well as extrinsic obstacles to the success of this approach for much more prevalent non-hematopoietic malignancies. In addition, we summarize recent strategies and innovations that aim to augment the potency of CAR T cells in the face of multiple immunosuppressive barriers operative within the solid tumor microenvironment. Advances in the field of CAR T cell biology over the coming years in the areas of safety, reliability and efficacy against non-hematopoietic cancers will ultimately determine how transformative adoptive T cell therapy will be in the broader battle against cancer.",

        "abstract": "Infants with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) continue to have significantly worse outcomes compared with older children with B-ALL, and those with relapsed or refractory (R/R) infant ALL have especially dismal outcomes with conventional treatment. CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in the treatment of R/R childhood B-ALL, although the majority of reports have been in noninfant patients. Barriers to the successful implementation of CAR T-cell therapy in infant B-ALL include challenges related to apheresis, product manufacturing, and disease-specific considerations such as lineage switch. We describe our experience using 2 experimental CD19 CAR T-cell products, SCRI-CAR19 or SCRI-CAR19x22, for 19 patients with R/R infant B-ALL enrolled in 3 clinical trials. CAR T-cell products were successfully manufactured in 18 of 19 (94.7%) patients, with a median age of 22.5\u00a0months at enrollment (range, 14.5-40.1). Of 17 (94.1%) treated patients, 16 achieved a complete remission without detectable minimal residual disease. The 1-year leukemia-free survival was 75%, and 1-year overall survival was 76.5%, with a median follow-up time of 35.8\u00a0months (range, 1.7-83.6). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 14 of 17 (82.4%) patients, with only 1 patient experiencing grade 3 CRS. Neurotoxicity occurred in 2 of 17 (11.8%) patients with all events grade \u22642.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The involvement of B-cells in multiple sclerosis has only recently emerged. Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the B-cell antigen CD20 with enhanced B-cell targeting. AREAS COVERED: This evaluation is of the identical ULTIMATE (UbLiTuximab In Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Effects) I and II trials comparing ublituximab (TG-1101) and teriflunomide in relapsing multiple sclerosis. The primary efficacy end point was the annualized relapse rate and was lower in the ublituximab than the teriflunomide group. EXPERT OPINION: The continuation rates to oral teriflunomide in ULTIMATE were higher than in other trials, possibly because of the supervised double-dummy protocol used with intravenous ublituximab. This may have contributed to the higher efficacy with teriflunomide in this trial than previously reported. Nevertheless, ublituximab was more effective than teriflunomide at reducing the annualized relapse rates and MRI endpoints, but not for no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the ULTIMATE trials did show that ublituximab was superior to teriflunomide in NEDA. Long-term studies of the adverse effects of ublituximab are required. Despite the positive results from ULTIMATE for ublituximab, it is still under the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and conclusions should await their findings.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can be caused by a broad range of pathogens; however, bacterial infections represent the majority of sepsis cases. Up to 42% of sepsis presentations are culture negative, suggesting a non-bacterial cause. Despite this, diagnosis of viral sepsis remains very rare. Almost any virus can cause sepsis in vulnerable patients (e.g., neonates, infants, and other immunosuppressed groups). The prevalence of viral sepsis is not known, nor is there enough information to make an accurate estimate. The initial standard of care for all cases of sepsis, even those that are subsequently proven to be culture negative, is the immediate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the absence of definite diagnostic criteria for viral sepsis, or at least to exclude bacterial sepsis, this inevitably leads to unnecessary antimicrobial use, with associated consequences for antimicrobial resistance, effects on the host microbiome and excess healthcare costs. It is important to understand non-bacterial causes of sepsis so that inappropriate treatment can be minimised, and appropriate treatments can be developed to improve outcomes. In this review, we summarise what is known about viral sepsis, its most common causes, and how the immune responses to severe viral infections can contribute to sepsis. We also discuss strategies to improve our understanding of viral sepsis, and ways we can integrate this new information into effective treatment.",

Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) uses the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to grade organ dysfunction in adult patients with suspected infection. However, the SOFA score is not adjusted for age and therefore not suitable for children. OBJECTIVES: To adapt and validate a pediatric version of the SOFA score (pSOFA) in critically ill children and to evaluate the Sepsis-3 definitions in patients with confirmed or suspected infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective observational cohort study included all critically ill children 21 years or younger admitted to a 20-bed, multidisciplinary, tertiary pediatric intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and August 1, 2016. Data on these children were obtained from an electronic health record database. The pSOFA score was developed by adapting the original SOFA score with age-adjusted cutoffs for the cardiovascular and renal systems and by expanding the respiratory criteria to include noninvasive surrogates of lung injury. Daily pSOFA scores were calculated from admission until day 28 of hospitalization, discharge, or death (whichever came first). Three additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were calculated for comparison. EXPOSURES: Organ dysfunction measured by the pSOFA score, and sepsis and septic shock according to the Sepsis-3 definitions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The daily pSOFA scores and additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were compared. Performance was evaluated using the area under the curve. The pSOFA score was then used to assess the Sepsis-3 definitions in the subgroup of children with confirmed or suspected infection. RESULTS: In all, 6303 patients with 8711 encounters met inclusion criteria. Each encounter was treated independently. Of the 8482 survivors of hospital encounters, 4644 (54.7%) were male and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 69 (17-156) months. Among the 229 nonsurvivors, 127 (55.4%) were male with a median (IQR) age of 43 (8-144) months. In-hospital mortality was 2.6%. The maximum pSOFA score had excellent discrimination for in-hospital mortality, with an area under the curve of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92-0.95). The pSOFA score had a similar or better performance than other pediatric organ dysfunction scores. According to the Sepsis-3 definitions, 1231 patients (14.1%) were classified as having sepsis and had a mortality rate of 12.1%, and 347 (4.0%) had septic shock and a mortality rate of 32.3%. Patients with sepsis were more likely to die than patients with confirmed or suspected infection but no sepsis (odds ratio, 18; 95% CI, 11-28). Of the 229 patients who died during their hospitalization, 149 (65.0%) had sepsis or septic shock during their course. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The pSOFA score was adapted and validated with age-adjusted variables in critically ill children.

        "abstract": "Exposure to pyrethroids, a significant class of the most widely used agricultural chemicals, has been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, although many different pyrethroids induce roughly the same symptoms of Parkinsonism, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To find the shared key features among these mechanisms, we focused on 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common and prominent metabolite of most pyrethroids produced via hydrolysis by CEs in mammals. To determine the contribution of 3-PBA to the initiation and progression of PD, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively, and found that 3-PBA not only accumulates in murine brain tissues over time but also further induces PD-like pathologies (increased \u03b1-syn and phospho-S129, decreased TH) to the same or even greater extent than the precursor pyrethroid. A before-after study of PET-DAT in the same mice revealed that low concentrations of 3-PBA (0.5 mg/kg) could paradoxically cause DAT to increase (22.46% higher than pre-drug test). The intervention of DAT inhibitors and activators respectively alleviated and enhanced the dopaminergic toxicity of 3-PBA, indicating that 3-PBA interacts with DAT. In particular, low concentrations of 3-PBA increase the DAT, which in turn induces 3-PBA to enter the dopaminergic neurons to exert toxic effects. Finally, we described a mechanism underlying this potential role of 3-PBA in the pathological aggregation of \u03b1-syn. Specifically, 3-PBA was found to dysregulate C/EBP \u03b2 levels and further anomalously activate AEP in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by increased accumulation of pathologically cleaved \u03b1-syn (N103 fragments) and accelerated \u03b1-syn aggregation. All these results suggest that 3-PBA exposure could mimic the pathological and pathogenetic features of PD, showing that this metabolite is a key pathogenic compound in pyrethroid-related pathological effects and a possible dopamine neurotoxin. Additionally, our findings provide a crucial reference for the primary prevention of PD.",

        "title": "Epidemiology of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis in children in Switzerland: a population-based cohort study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. We assessed population-based incidence and outcomes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis in children in Switzerland. METHODS: We did a multicentre, prospective, cohort study at ten paediatric hospitals in Switzerland. We included neonates and children younger than 17 years with blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis. Children were eligible if they met criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome-according to 2005 paediatric consensus definition- at the time of blood culture sampling. Incidence was calculated by dividing the number of annual sepsis episodes in the study for the years 2012-15 by the end-of-year resident paediatric population in Switzerland. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in the first 30 days after sepsis onset. FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2011, and Dec 31, 2015, we enrolled 1096 children to our study. Of 1181 episodes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis, 382 (32%) occurred in 379 previously healthy children, 402 (34%) in 391 neonates, and 397 (34%) in 341 children with comorbidities. Incidence was 25\u00b71 cases per 100\u2008000 (95% CI 23\u00b78-26\u00b74) in children and 146\u00b70 cases per 100\u2008000 (133\u00b72-159\u00b76) in neonates. Central line-associated bloodstream infections and primary bloodstream infections accounted for 569 (48%) of 1181 episodes, and organ dysfunction was present in 455 (39%) of 1181 episodes. Escherichia coli (242 of 1181 [20%]), Staphylococcus aureus (177 of 1181 [15%]), coagulase-negative staphylococci (135 of 1181 [11%]), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (118 of 1181 [10%]) were the most prevalent pathogens in our study, accounting for 57% of episodes. The overall case-fatality ratio was 7% (82 of 1181 episodes; 95% CI 5\u00b76-8\u00b76), and it was higher in neonates (11%, 45 of 402 episodes; 8\u00b74-14\u00b78; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 4\u00b741, 95% CI 1\u00b775-11\u00b71) and children with comorbidities (7%, 27 of 397 episodes; 4\u00b76-9\u00b79; OR 4\u00b797, 1\u00b784-13\u00b74) compared with previously healthy children (3%, ten of 382 episodes; 1\u00b73-4\u00b79). The case-fatality ratio was 1% (five of 726 episodes [95% CI 0\u00b73-1\u00b77]) for children without organ dysfunction, which increased to 17% (77 of 455 episodes [13\u00b77-20\u00b78]) when organ dysfunction was present (adjusted OR 4\u00b784, 95% CI 1\u00b740-16\u00b77). INTERPRETATION: The burden of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis on child health remains considerable. We recorded key differences in predominant organisms, severity, and outcome between neonates, previously healthy children, and children with comorbidities. Although for most episodes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis, no organ dysfunction was seen, presence of organ dysfunction was strongly associated with mortality.

        "abstract": "Hereditary amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) encompasses a group of genetic disorders characterized by adult-onset loss of the lower and upper motor neuron systems, often with involvement of other parts of the nervous system. Cases of hereditary ALS have been attributed to mutations in 12 different genes, the most common being SOD1, FUS and TARDBP-mutations in the other genes are rare. The identified genes explain 25-35% of cases of familial ALS, but identifying the remaining genes has proved difficult. Only a few genes seem to account for significant numbers of ALS cases, with many others causing a few cases each. Hereditary ALS can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked manner, and families with low disease penetrance are frequently observed. In such families, the genetic predisposition may remain unnoticed, so many patients carry a diagnosis of isolated or sporadic ALS. The only clinical feature that distinguishes recognized hereditary from apparently sporadic ALS is a lower mean age of onset in the former. All the clinical features reported in hereditary cases (including signs of extrapyramidal, cerebellar or cognitive involvement) have also been observed in sporadic cases. Genetic counseling and risk assessment in relatives depend on establishing the specific gene defect and the disease penetrance in the particular family.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. There is a paucity of data on the criteria used to define sepsis and septic shock and predict mortality. Schlapbach et al. published Phoenix criteria to define sepsis in JAMA in 2024. Previously, paediatricians have used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, but these criteria lack sensitivity and specificity. This group recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Though included in the 8-point criteria, important criteria like renal and liver are missing from the main criteria. We remain worried about the way these criteria got excluded from the main criteria. Therefore, in this brief report, whilst commending the authors for this stelar task, we highlight the main pitfalls in these criteria especially the renal, neurologic, and liver criteria. These criteria have been shown to be independently associated with outcomes, and we recommend that in the future iterations of the criteria, renal and liver criteria should be defined according to latest definitions and the task force consider utilizing latest criteria for each organ system involved within the formulated criteria. CONCLUSION: \u00a0In conclusion, Phoenix criteria are a step in the right direction to define life-threatening organ dysfunction in sepsis, but clinicians need to be mindful that diagnosis/treatment of less severe sepsis should not be delayed if these criteria are not met. Therefore, local early detection and management tools for sepsis should be followed. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 There has always been a quest for a definition for pediatric sepsis. There are limitations to the previous pediatric sepsis criteria which were published in 2005 by the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC). IPSCC defines sepsis as a suspected or confirmed infection in the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). These new Phoenix Pediatric Sepsis (PPS) criteria for sepsis and septic shock are intended to identify children with life-threatening organ dysfunction due to infection, and the score was developed based on a very large pediatric dataset. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022 Though the intention of Phoenix criteria is to help identify children with life threatening organ dysfunction, unfortunately the crietria will miss signs of early sepis. In this manuscript, we point out some of the drawbacks of these criteria which need to be borne in mind while applying these criteria.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "title": "Phoenix criteria for sepsis: are these enough to guide a clinician?",
        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. There is a paucity of data on the criteria used to define sepsis and septic shock and predict mortality. Schlapbach et al. published Phoenix criteria to define sepsis in JAMA in 2024. Previously, paediatricians have used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, but these criteria lack sensitivity and specificity. This group recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Though included in the 8-point criteria, important criteria like renal and liver are missing from the main criteria. We remain worried about the way these criteria got excluded from the main criteria. Therefore, in this brief report, whilst commending the authors for this stelar task, we highlight the main pitfalls in these criteria especially the renal, neurologic, and liver criteria. These criteria have been shown to be independently associated with outcomes, and we recommend that in the future iterations of the criteria, renal and liver criteria should be defined according to latest definitions and the task force consider utilizing latest criteria for each organ system involved within the formulated criteria. CONCLUSION: \u00a0In conclusion, Phoenix criteria are a step in the right direction to define life-threatening organ dysfunction in sepsis, but clinicians need to be mindful that diagnosis/treatment of less severe sepsis should not be delayed if these criteria are not met. Therefore, local early detection and management tools for sepsis should be followed. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 There has always been a quest for a definition for pediatric sepsis. There are limitations to the previous pediatric sepsis criteria which were published in 2005 by the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC). IPSCC defines sepsis as a suspected or confirmed infection in the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). These new Phoenix Pediatric Sepsis (PPS) criteria for sepsis and septic shock are intended to identify children with life-threatening organ dysfunction due to infection, and the score was developed based on a very large pediatric dataset. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022 Though the intention of Phoenix criteria is to help identify children with life threatening organ dysfunction, unfortunately the crietria will miss signs of early sepis. In this manuscript, we point out some of the drawbacks of these criteria which need to be borne in mind while applying these criteria.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cannabis use has been the most commonly used illicit psychoactive substance in India. Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The involvement of B-cells in multiple sclerosis has only recently emerged. Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the B-cell antigen CD20 with enhanced B-cell targeting. AREAS COVERED: This evaluation is of the identical ULTIMATE (UbLiTuximab In Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Effects) I and II trials comparing ublituximab (TG-1101) and teriflunomide in relapsing multiple sclerosis. The primary efficacy end point was the annualized relapse rate and was lower in the ublituximab than the teriflunomide group. EXPERT OPINION: The continuation rates to oral teriflunomide in ULTIMATE were higher than in other trials, possibly because of the supervised double-dummy protocol used with intravenous ublituximab. This may have contributed to the higher efficacy with teriflunomide in this trial than previously reported. Nevertheless, ublituximab was more effective than teriflunomide at reducing the annualized relapse rates and MRI endpoints, but not for no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the ULTIMATE trials did show that ublituximab was superior to teriflunomide in NEDA. Long-term studies of the adverse effects of ublituximab are required. Despite the positive results from ULTIMATE for ublituximab, it is still under the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and conclusions should await their findings.",

        "title": "Adaptation and Validation of a Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score and Evaluation of the Sepsis-3 Definitions in Critically Ill Children.",
        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) uses the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to grade organ dysfunction in adult patients with suspected infection. However, the SOFA score is not adjusted for age and therefore not suitable for children. OBJECTIVES: To adapt and validate a pediatric version of the SOFA score (pSOFA) in critically ill children and to evaluate the Sepsis-3 definitions in patients with confirmed or suspected infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective observational cohort study included all critically ill children 21 years or younger admitted to a 20-bed, multidisciplinary, tertiary pediatric intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and August 1, 2016. Data on these children were obtained from an electronic health record database. The pSOFA score was developed by adapting the original SOFA score with age-adjusted cutoffs for the cardiovascular and renal systems and by expanding the respiratory criteria to include noninvasive surrogates of lung injury. Daily pSOFA scores were calculated from admission until day 28 of hospitalization, discharge, or death (whichever came first). Three additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were calculated for comparison. EXPOSURES: Organ dysfunction measured by the pSOFA score, and sepsis and septic shock according to the Sepsis-3 definitions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The daily pSOFA scores and additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were compared. Performance was evaluated using the area under the curve. The pSOFA score was then used to assess the Sepsis-3 definitions in the subgroup of children with confirmed or suspected infection. RESULTS: In all, 6303 patients with 8711 encounters met inclusion criteria. Each encounter was treated independently. Of the 8482 survivors of hospital encounters, 4644 (54.7%) were male and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 69 (17-156) months. Among the 229 nonsurvivors, 127 (55.4%) were male with a median (IQR) age of 43 (8-144) months. In-hospital mortality was 2.6%. The maximum pSOFA score had excellent discrimination for in-hospital mortality, with an area under the curve of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92-0.95). The pSOFA score had a similar or better performance than other pediatric organ dysfunction scores. According to the Sepsis-3 definitions, 1231 patients (14.1%) were classified as having sepsis and had a mortality rate of 12.1%, and 347 (4.0%) had septic shock and a mortality rate of 32.3%. Patients with sepsis were more likely to die than patients with confirmed or suspected infection but no sepsis (odds ratio, 18; 95% CI, 11-28). Of the 229 patients who died during their hospitalization, 149 (65.0%) had sepsis or septic shock during their course. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The pSOFA score was adapted and validated with age-adjusted variables in critically ill children. Using the pSOFA score, the Sepsis-3 definitions were assessed in children with confirmed or suspected infection. This study is the first assessment, to date, of the Sepsis-3 definitions in critically ill children. Use of these definitions in children is feasible and shows promising results.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to pyrethroids, a significant class of the most widely used agricultural chemicals, has been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, although many different pyrethroids induce roughly the same symptoms of Parkinsonism, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To find the shared key features among these mechanisms, we focused on 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common and prominent metabolite of most pyrethroids produced via hydrolysis by CEs in mammals. To determine the contribution of 3-PBA to the initiation and progression of PD, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively, and found that 3-PBA not only accumulates in murine brain tissues over time but also further induces PD-like pathologies (increased \u03b1-syn and phospho-S129, decreased TH) to the same or even greater extent than the precursor pyrethroid. A before-after study of PET-DAT in the same mice revealed that low concentrations of 3-PBA (0.5 mg/kg) could paradoxically cause DAT to increase (22.46% higher than pre-drug test). The intervention of DAT inhibitors and activators respectively alleviated and enhanced the dopaminergic toxicity of 3-PBA, indicating that 3-PBA interacts with DAT. In particular, low concentrations of 3-PBA increase the DAT, which in turn induces 3-PBA to enter the dopaminergic neurons to exert toxic effects. Finally, we described a mechanism underlying this potential role of 3-PBA in the pathological aggregation of \u03b1-syn. Specifically, 3-PBA was found to dysregulate C/EBP \u03b2 levels and further anomalously activate AEP in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by increased accumulation of pathologically cleaved \u03b1-syn (N103 fragments) and accelerated \u03b1-syn aggregation. All these results suggest that 3-PBA exposure could mimic the pathological and pathogenetic features of PD, showing that this metabolite is a key pathogenic compound in pyrethroid-related pathological effects and a possible dopamine neurotoxin. Additionally, our findings provide a crucial reference for the primary prevention of PD.",

The recently established therapeutic targeting of B cells in MS patients using CD20 monoclonal antibodies (CD20-mAbs) not only profoundly suppresses inflammatory disease activity but also materializes as the first treatment approach against disability accumulation in a subset of patients with primary progressive MS. AREAS COVERED: We will review current concepts regarding the immunopathology of B cells as well as results of clinical trials with CD20-mAbs in MS, from the murine-human chimeras rituximab and ublituximab to their increasingly humanized counterparts ocrelizumab and ofatumumab. We conducted a literature search using PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov, and clinicaltrialsregister.eu. We will focus on studies emphasizing the effectiveness of these mAbs in reducing MS disease activity and progression, long-term safety, optimal dosage and maintenance regimens. Lastly, we will turn to outstanding questions regarding anti-CD20 therapy in MS. EXPERT OPINION: CD20-mAbs could become first-line drugs in selected patients with highly active MS and already constitute an option for PPMS. Future studies could evaluate whether administration regimens currently in use can be optimized, while registry data could shed light on risk versus benefits on the long run, considering immunosenescence and a potentially increased risk of malignancies and infections in an aging population.",

We also monitored clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance. METHOD: We studied 3986 positive blood cultures from children up to 17\u00a0years of age at a paediatric hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, using data from medical records before and after the initiatives, to reduce early onset sepsis, were introduced in 2007 and 2008. RESULTS: Bloodstream infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae declined by 42% overall (5.6 to 3.2/100\u00a0000) and by 62% in previously healthy children under 36\u00a0months of age (24.2 to 9.2/100\u00a0000). Early onset sepsis caused by group B streptococcus declined by 60% (0.5 to 0.2/1000 live born children). Bacterial meningitis caused by these bacteria decreased by 70%. Staphylococcus aureus and various Gram-negative bacteria became the dominant pathogens, in both previously healthy children and those with underlying disease. Overall, antimicrobial resistance remained low between the two 5-year study periods. CONCLUSION: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and risk-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus effectively decreased the incidence of bloodstream infections. Empirical antibiotic therapy should target Staphylococcus aureus in\u00a0both community and hospital-acquired invasive bacterial infections.",

This new disease entity was described as mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome (MPSPS). The name of the disease indicates that in addition to the typical symptoms of conventional MPS, patients develop other features such as congenital heart defects and kidney and hematopoietic system disorders. The symptoms are highly advanced, and patients usually do not survive past the second year of life. MPSPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a homozygous-specific mutation in the gene encoding the VPS33A protein. To date, it has been described in 41 patients. Patients with MPSPS exhibited excessive excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the urine and exceptionally high levels of heparan sulfate in the plasma, but the accumulation of substrates is not caused by a decrease in the activity of any lysosomal enzymes. Here, we discuss the pathomechanisms and symptoms of MPSPS, comparing them to those of MPS. Moreover, we asked the question whether MPSPS should be classified as a type of MPS or a separate disease, as contrary to 'classical' MPS types, despite GAG accumulation, no defects in lysosomal enzymes responsible for degradation of these compounds could be detected in MPSPS. The molecular mechanism of the appearance of GAG accumulation in MPSPS is suggested on the basis of results available in the literature.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease and is the most common cause of dementia. Lecanemab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid protofibrils for the treatment of early AD. In the phase II BAN2401-G000-201 trial (NCT01767311), lecanemab reduced amyloid accumulated in the brain and slowed progression on key global and cognitive scales evaluating efficacy after 18\u00a0months of treatment. METHODS: A disease simulation model was used to predict the long-term clinical outcomes of lecanemab for patients with early AD [i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and mild AD dementia] on the basis of BAN2401-G000-201 trial data and published literature. The model captures the pathophysiology and management of AD, with a focus on simulating the effects of disease modification and early intervention on disease progression. The model compares lecanemab in addition to standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone. RESULTS: Lecanemab treatment was estimated to slow the rate of disease progression, resulting in an extended duration of MCI due to AD and mild AD dementia and shortened duration in moderate and severe AD dementia. The mean time to mild, moderate, and severe AD dementia was longer for patients in the lecanemab\u2009+\u2009SoC group than for patients in the SoC group by 2.51, 3.13, and 2.34\u00a0years, respectively. On base-case analysis, lecanemab was associated with 0.73 incremental life years (LY) and 0.75 incremental quality-adjusted LYs (QALY), and the caregiver QALYs lost was reduced by 0.03\u00a0years. The model also predicted a lower lifetime probability of admission to institutional care in lecanemab\u2009+\u2009SoC versus SoC group (25% versus 31%). CONCLUSION: The model results demonstrate the potential clinical value of lecanemab for patients with early AD and how it can slow the rate of disease progression and reduce the lifetime probability for institutionalized care.",

Despite having potentially life-threatening toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, the benefits of CAR T-cell therapy far outweigh these risks, particularly as increased experience and improved supportive care measures are mitigating these toxicities. CAR T cells can result in complete remission for significant proportion of patients with relapsed and refractory B-ALL and permit them to proceed to potentially curative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). CAR T cells may also be curative by themselves. Herein lie the greatest challenges and questions for clinical investigators, specifically, how are CAR T cells best employed and how do we overcome mechanisms of resistance to them? The primary clinical question is the timing and even the necessity of allo-HSCT. Relative to resistance, we know that target antigen loss, specifically CD19, is a major contributor to resistance. However, current investigations of alternative targets, such CD22, and CAR T cells expressing dual targeting antigen receptors have demonstrated encouraging initial results and provide a high degree of optimism that the efficacy and the broader application of CAR T-cell therapy will gradually increase in B-ALL. That optimism is not as high and the challenges are increased for the application of CAR T cells in T-cell leukemias and acute myeloid leukemia due to the relative lack of suitable leukemia surface targets that are not also expressed on normal hematopoietic progenitors. Despite these significant challenges, considerable research is being conducted into the development of CAR T cells for these diseases utilizing unique technologies, which may be applicable to other diseases.",

        "title": "International pediatric sepsis consensus conference: definitions for sepsis and organ dysfunction in pediatrics.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although general definitions of the sepsis continuum have been published for adults, no such work has been done for the pediatric population. Physiologic and laboratory variables used to define the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and organ dysfunction require modification for the developmental stages of children. An international panel of 20 experts in sepsis and clinical research from five countries (Canada, France, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States) was convened to modify the published adult consensus definitions of infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction for children. DESIGN: Consensus conference. METHODS: This document describes the issues surrounding consensus on four major questions addressed at the meeting: a) How should the pediatric age groups affected by sepsis be delineated? b) What are the specific definitions of pediatric SIRS, infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock? c) What are the specific definitions of pediatric organ failure and the validity of pediatric organ failure scores? d) What are the appropriate study populations and study end points required to successfully conduct clinical trials in pediatric sepsis? Five subgroups first met separately and then together to evaluate the following areas: signs and symptoms of sepsis, cell markers, cytokines, microbiological data, and coagulation variables. All conference participants approved the final draft of the proceedings of the meeting. RESULTS: Conference attendees modified the current criteria used to define SIRS and sepsis in adults to incorporate pediatric physiologic variables appropriate for the following subcategories of children: newborn, neonate, infant, child, and adolescent. In addition, the SIRS definition was modified so that either criteria for fever or white blood count had to be met. We also defined various organ dysfunction categories, severe sepsis, and septic shock specifically for children. Although no firm conclusion was made regarding a single appropriate study end point, a novel nonmortality end point, organ failure-free days, was considered optimal for pediatric clinical trials given the relatively low incidence of mortality in pediatric sepsis compared with adult populations. CONCLUSION: We modified the adult SIRS criteria for children. In addition, we revised definitions of severe sepsis and septic shock for the pediatric population. Our goal is for these first-generation pediatric definitions and criteria to facilitate the performance of successful clinical studies in children with sepsis.",

Despite advances in treatment, MM patients eventually experienced a relapse of the disease. Penta-drug refractory patients continue to be the hard core of relapsed/refractory (RR) settings. Teclistamab-cqyv is a humanized IgG4 antibody and a bispecific BCMA-director CD3 T-cell engager. It recruits endogenous T cells, by targeting CD3 receptors expressed on their surface, resulting in their activation against BCMA, an antigen expressed by plasma cells. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have approved Teclistamab-cqyv in monotherapy for the treatment of RRMM patients who have received at least three prior therapies, including immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors (PIs), and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and have demonstrated disease progression during the last therapy. Its effectiveness was demonstrated in a pivotal clinical trial where the overall response rate (ORR) reached 60%. Other clinical studies are currently ongoing to investigate the association of the bispecific antibody with novel drugs with encouraging preliminary results, especially in the setting of heavily pretreated patients. In this review, the authors will provide a comprehensive overview of the drug, including its mechanism of action, major clinical trials, and future perspectives.",

Literature has found reciprocal relations between parental depression and child psychopathology and effects of parental depression on children's cognition. The present study is the first to examine reciprocity among parental depression and child cognition, and pathways to child psychopathology. Structural equation models were conducted using data from the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project, a nationally representative sample of 3,001 economically marginalized families. Measures were collected in four waves from 14 months to 10-11 years. Reciprocal associations emerged between maternal and paternal depression at from 14 months to 5 years. Reciprocal parental depression was associated with greater psychopathology at age 10-11. Maternal depression predicted poorer child cognition, which indirectly predicted increased depression in mothers of children aged 3-5 through paternal depression, and in fathers at age 3, through earlier paternal depression. This study was unable to parse within- and between-person effects. Additionally, data for paternal depression was limited to ages 2 and 3. Findings emphasize the transactional nature of child cognition and child and parent psychopathology, supporting family focused intervention and prevention efforts that target parent psychopathology and child cognition.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is unmet need for male contraceptive options, but a recent injectable combination male contraceptive trial was terminated early due to adverse events (AEs). METHODS: We examined the frequency of reported AEs by male research participants compared with AEs reported in prescribing information of approved female hormonal contraceptive methods. Published data from trials of the top five most-used female hormonal contraceptives, supplemented by contemporary contraceptive research, were compared with the frequency of AEs reported in a male injectable hormonal contraceptive trial. RESULTS: We observed similar frequencies of AEs reported by users of male contraceptives compared with those reported by female users. Among quantitatively comparable AEs, compared with men, women reported experiencing higher frequencies of headaches, pelvic pain, and weight gain and similar frequencies of decreased libido. Compared with women, men reported experiencing higher frequencies of acne and mood changes. Men discontinued participation due to AEs at a lower frequency than women. CONCLUSIONS: Female hormonal methods generally have similar frequencies of AEs to those reported in a recent male hormonal contraceptive trial, and male users had lower rates of discontinuation due to AEs. There were fewer serious AEs of the male contraceptive than reported in contemporary female trials which resulted in FDA licensure. This suggests there may be implicit bias in the scientific community regarding the level of acceptable risk for users of male contraceptive methods.",

        "abstract": "An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7th Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD \u00b1 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged .16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged .15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called 'invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised riskbehaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the \"invisible\" risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.",

        "title": "Host gene expression signatures to identify infection type and organ dysfunction in children evaluated for sepsis: a multicentre cohort study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "abstract": "Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas define a spectrum of disorders associated with T-lymphocytic proliferation with clinical manifestations occurring in the skin during the course of the disease. This review has dealt with two rather uncommon disorders, namely mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome which are indolent malignant lymphomas, occurring primarily in the fifth decade, and affecting males most frequently. Historically, mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome have been described for a relatively short time. As witnessed by Table 2, little was known concerning these disorders, other than clinical and pathologic features, until the application of immunologic, cell biologic, and cytogenetic technology which burgeoned a multitude of questions. The discovery of TCGF has allowed for both continuous growth of normal and neoplastic T cells and for the clonal expansion of some malignant clones. The establishment of these continuous cultures allowed for: (1) investigation of the mechanism of TCGF production and stimulation of T-cell growth, and (2) identification of HTLV, a retrovirus found in cell cultures from two patients with CTCL, and subsequently from patients with Japanese adult T-cell lymphoma. In addition, the HTLV has been related to a more virulent form of T-cell malignancy. The exact etiologic role of this virus in the CTCL is presently the subject of intense investigation. Through the use of immunologic methods the malignant cell of CTCL has been pheno-typically and functionally characterized as a \"helper/inducer\" subtype (E rosette+, anti-T-cell antisera+, T11+, T1+, T3+, 3A1-, T6-, T8-) and usually Ia-, HLADR-. Clinical manifestations of the phenotype may be clinically apparent in the serologic abnormalities present in these disorders. Utilizing these methods to investigate these disorders may provide a key to the understanding of T-cell function and cellular immunity much as myeloma provided a model for the understanding of B cells and immunity. Clinically and pathologically, these disorders behave as malignant indolent lymphomas with spread from localized cutaneous lesions to extracutaneous involvement of the blood, lymph nodes, and viscera culminating in the death of the patient from either organ dysfunction or infectious complications. At autopsy, this extracutaneous involvement is more pronounced than what was expected ante-mortem. Application of prospective staging techniques employing such special procedures as E-rosette cytology, cytogenetics, and electron microscopy in addition to usual light microscopy studies has demonstrated a greater percentage of extracutaneous involvement than otherwise expected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets soluble aggregated A\u03b2 species (protofibrils), has demonstrated robust brain fibrillar amyloid reduction and slowing of clinical decline in early AD. The objective of this analysis is to report results from study 201 blinded period (core), the open-label extension (OLE), and gap period (between core and OLE) supporting the effectiveness of lecanemab. METHODS: The lecanemab study 201 core was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 856 patients randomized to one of five dose regimens or placebo. An OLE of study 201 was initiated to allow patients to receive open-label lecanemab 10mg/kg biweekly for up to 24 months, with an intervening off-treatment period (gap period) ranging from 9 to 59 months (mean 24 months). RESULTS: At 12 and 18 months of treatment in the core, lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly demonstrated dose-dependent reductions of brain amyloid measured PET and corresponding changes in plasma biomarkers and slowing of cognitive decline. The rates of clinical progression during the gap were similar in lecanemab and placebo subjects, with clinical treatment differences maintained after discontinued dosing over an average of 24 months in the gap period. During the gap, plasma A\u03b242/40 ratio and p-tau181 levels began to return towards pre-randomization levels more quickly than amyloid PET. At OLE baseline, treatment differences vs placebo at 18 months in the randomized period were maintained across 3 clinical assessments. In the OLE, lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly treatment produced dose-dependent reductions in amyloid PET SUVr, improvements in plasma A\u03b242/40 ratio, and reductions in plasma p-tau181. CONCLUSIONS: Lecanemab treatment resulted in significant reduction in amyloid plaques and a slowing of clinical decline. Data indicate that rapid and pronounced amyloid reduction correlates with clinical benefit and potential disease-modifying effects, as well as the potential to use plasma biomarkers to monitor for lecanemab treatment effects.

        "abstract": "The general interest in the availability of male contraceptives is on the increase across different cultures and ethnic backgrounds, due in part to the fact that men are now willing more than ever, to share the responsibility of family planning. Despite the expression of interest and tremendous advances in research however, a modern male hormonal contraceptive method has remained an elusive goal. Testosterone (T) alone, or in combination with a progestin currently provides the most promising lead to male hormonal contraception. The principle relies on enhanced negative feedback of exogenous T to suppress gonadotropins, thereby blocking the endocrine stimulus for the process of spermatogenesis. A serious drawback is the inconsistent suppression among men of different ethnic backgrounds. This has increased the quest for development to include other nonhormonal methods. In reality many obstacles still have to be overcome before an acceptable method is available. In this review, we highlight recent developments in male hormonal contraceptives methods. Based on our recent findings from animal experiment, we shed light on why the method is not achieving the intended results, and suggest possible ways forward.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to derive a novel prognostic score for mortality in paediatric meningococcal sepsis (MS) based on readily available laboratory markers. METHODS: A multicentre retrospective cohort study for the consortium set and a single centre retrospective study for replication set. The consortium set were 1,073 children (age 1 week to 17.9 years) referred over a 15-year period (1996 to 2011), who had an admission diagnosis of MS, referred to paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in six different European centres. The consortium set was split into a development set and validation set to derive the score. The replication set were 134 children with MS (age 2 weeks to 16 years) referred over a 4-year period (2007 to 2011) to PICUs via the Children's Acute Transport Service (CATS), London. RESULTS: A total of 85/1,073 (7.9%) children in the consortium set died. A total of 16/134 (11.9%) children in the replication set died. Children dying in the consortium set had significantly lower base excess, C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet and white cell count, more deranged coagulation and higher lactate than survivors. Paediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) score, Glasgow meningococcal septicaemia prognosis score (GMSPS) and Rotterdam score were also higher. Using the consortium set, a new scoring system using base excess and platelet count at presentation, termed the BEP score, was mathematically developed and validated. BEP predicted mortality with high sensitivity and specificity scores (area under the curve (AUC) in the validation set=0.86 and in the replication set=0.96). In the validation set, BEP score performance (AUC=0.86, confidence interval (CI): 0.80 to 0.91) was better than GMSPS (AUC=0.77, CI: 0.68, 0.85), similar to Rotterdam (AUC=0.87, CI: 0.81 to 0.93) and not as good as PRISM (AUC=0.93, CI: 0.85 to 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: The BEP score, relying on only two variables that are quickly and objectively measurable and readily available at presentation, is highly sensitive and specific in predicting death from MS in childhood.",

In order to define more appropriate targets for innovative pharmacological therapies for disruptive/conduct disorders, the European Commission within the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) funded the MATRICS project (Multidisciplinary Approaches to Translational Research in Conduct Syndromes) to identify neural, genetic, and molecular factors underpinning the pathogenesis of aggression/antisocial behavior in preclinical models and clinical samples. Within the program, a multicentre case-control study, followed by a single-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, randomized acute single-dose medication challenge, was conducted at two Italian sites. Aggressive children and adolescents with conduct disorder (CD) or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) were compared to the same age (10-17 y) typically developing controls (TDC) on a neuropsychological tasks battery that included both \"cold\" (e.g., inhibitory control, decision making) and \"hot\" executive functions (e.g., moral judgment, emotion processing, risk assessment). Selected autonomic measures (heart rate variability, skin conductance, salivary cortisol) were recorded before/during/after neuropsychological testing sessions. The acute response to different drugs (methylphenidate/atomoxetine, risperidone/aripiprazole, or placebo) was also examined in the ODD/CD cohort in order to identify potential neuropsychological/physiological mechanisms underlying aggression.

        "title": "rapidGSEA: Speeding up gene set enrichment analysis on multi-core CPUs and CUDA-enabled GPUs.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a popular method to reveal significant dependencies between predefined sets of gene symbols and observed phenotypes by evaluating the deviation of gene expression values between cases and controls. An established measure of inter-class deviation, the enrichment score, is usually computed using a weighted running sum statistic over the whole set of gene symbols. Due to the lack of analytic expressions the significance of enrichment scores is determined using a non-parametric estimation of their null distribution by permuting the phenotype labels of the probed patients. Accordingly, GSEA is a time-consuming task due to the large number of required permutations to accurately estimate the nominal p-value - a circumstance that is even more pronounced during multiple hypothesis testing since its estimate is lower-bounded by the inverse number of samples in permutation space. RESULTS: We present rapidGSEA - a software suite consisting of two tools for facilitating permutation-based GSEA: cudaGSEA and ompGSEA. cudaGSEA is a CUDA-accelerated tool using fine-grained parallelization schemes on massively parallel architectures while ompGSEA is a coarse-grained multi-threaded tool for multi-core CPUs. Nominal p-value estimation of 4,725 gene sets on a data set consisting of 20,639 unique gene symbols and 200 patients (183 cases + 17 controls) each probing one million permutations takes 19 hours on a Xeon CPU and less than one hour on a GeForce Titan X GPU while the established GSEA tool from the Broad Institute (broadGSEA) takes roughly 13 days. CONCLUSION: cudaGSEA outperforms broadGSEA by around two orders-of-magnitude on a single Tesla K40c or GeForce Titan X GPU. ompGSEA provides around one order-of-magnitude speedup to broadGSEA on a standard Xeon CPU. The rapidGSEA suite is open-source software and can be downloaded at https://github.com/gravitino/cudaGSEA as standalone application or package for the R framework.",

Non-pharmacologic interventions (psychosocial and restricted dietary interventions) have been shown to benefit oppositional, non-compliant, aggressive and disruptive, as well as hyperactive and inattentive behaviors in preschoolers with ADHD and other disruptive behavior disorders. However, not all families have access to non-pharmacologic interventions or prefer them. The Preschool ADHD Treatment Study recently provided evidence of benefit with immediate-release methylphenidate; however, effect sizes were small to moderate and preschoolers had a high rate of adverse effects and a unique adverse effect profile. Furthermore, no information is available about long-term safety and effects of psychopharmacologic agents on the rapidly developing brains of preschoolers. Based on current evidence and guidelines, a careful trial with psychopharmacologic agents is indicated to treat ADHD in preschoolers if there is no improvement with behavior therapy and the preschoolers continue to exhibit significantly impaired hyperactive and inattentive symptoms. Preschoolers should be monitored closely for adverse effects and tried off medications after 6 months to assess the need for ongoing psychopharmacologic intervention.

In CLD patients, fatigue manifests with both central symptoms, characterised by cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, apathy, and autonomic dysfunction, and peripheral symptoms, characterised by decreased exercise tolerance and reduced physical activity levels. The pathogenesis of fatigue in CLD is multifactorial and involves changes in the brain-liver axis resulting from changes in inflammatory cytokines or the gut microbiome. Numerous interventions have attempted to alleviate fatigue in CLD by improving its central and peripheral manifestations or the underlying liver disease.

In the A4 study, solanezumab did not reduce the decline in cognition or function and had no effect on brain amyloid burden. EXPERT OPINION: After the poor results in the EXPEDITION series of trials, the development of solanezumab should have been terminated. The rationale for undertaking the A4 trial was questionable, and the lack of benefit was probable. The controversial approval of two anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies (aducanumab and lecanemab) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), despite a high incidence of amyloid-related imagining abnormalities (ARIA), may be fueling this continuation of clinical development of agents such as solanezumab.

        "title": "Oral Contraceptives and the Risk of Psychiatric Side Effects: A Review.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral contraceptives (OCs) are an essential medicine used by millions of people every day. Given the widespread usage of these medicines, even a small increase in psychiatric risk could be of clinical significance. Although mood-related side effects are a common reason for OC hesitancy and discontinuation, studies investigating psychiatric responses to OC treatment have had inconsistent results. SUMMARY: While OCs are beneficial for most users, there is evidence that a subgroup of users is susceptible to mood side effects. Randomized controlled trials have generally failed to find differences in mood symptoms between OC and placebo users, but observational studies comparing OC users to non-users have reported increases in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. Additionally, observational evidence suggests that OC users may be more likely to use prescription psychotropic medications and to attempt or die by suicide. However, responses to OC treatment are highly heterogeneous, and some users report mood improvement. A variety of factors may increase the likelihood of negative psychiatric side effects, including younger age, previous experience of side effects from OCs, and preexisting psychiatric disorders. Progestin-only pills may confer a higher psychiatric risk than combination pills. KEY MESSAGES: Further research investigating factors that contribute to susceptibility to the mood-related side effects of OCs is clearly warranted. Genomic approaches may provide insight as to why some users experience side effects while others do not. Research elucidating who is most at risk and why will be essential to addressing prevalent concerns about the psychiatric risk of OCs.",

        "abstract": "Two different illness severity scores, Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) and the Glasgow Meningococcal Sepsis Prognostic Score (GMSPS), were evaluated and compared in meningococcal disease in two paediatric intensive care units. Forty-nine children with a median age of 36 months who had meningococcal sepsis confirmed by laboratory data were evaluated. Overall mortality was 18%. The median GMSPS was 3 in survivors and 8 in non-survivors. A GMSPS > or = 8 was significantly associated with death (p = 0.0001) with a mortality predictivity and specificity of 70% and 92.5%, respectively. The median PRISM score in survivors was 5.5 and 23 in non-survivors. A PRISM score of > or = 11 was significantly related to death (p < 0.0001). The Kendal correlation co-efficient between GMSPS and PRISM showed tau = 0.6859 (p = 0.0000). It is concluded that GMSPS and PRISM are useful methods for identifying and classifying children into low and high risk categories. GMSPS > or = 8 or a PRISM score > or = 11 are significantly predictive of mortality.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "abstract": "An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7th Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD \u00b1 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged .16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged .15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called 'invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised riskbehaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the \"invisible\" risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.",

We also monitored clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance. METHOD: We studied 3986 positive blood cultures from children up to 17\u00a0years of age at a paediatric hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, using data from medical records before and after the initiatives, to reduce early onset sepsis, were introduced in 2007 and 2008. RESULTS: Bloodstream infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae declined by 42% overall (5.6 to 3.2/100\u00a0000) and by 62% in previously healthy children under 36\u00a0months of age (24.2 to 9.2/100\u00a0000). Early onset sepsis caused by group B streptococcus declined by 60% (0.5 to 0.2/1000 live born children). Bacterial meningitis caused by these bacteria decreased by 70%. Staphylococcus aureus and various Gram-negative bacteria became the dominant pathogens, in both previously healthy children and those with underlying disease. Overall, antimicrobial resistance remained low between the two 5-year study periods. CONCLUSION: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and risk-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus effectively decreased the incidence of bloodstream infections.

This new disease entity was described as mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome (MPSPS). The name of the disease indicates that in addition to the typical symptoms of conventional MPS, patients develop other features such as congenital heart defects and kidney and hematopoietic system disorders. The symptoms are highly advanced, and patients usually do not survive past the second year of life. MPSPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a homozygous-specific mutation in the gene encoding the VPS33A protein. To date, it has been described in 41 patients. Patients with MPSPS exhibited excessive excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the urine and exceptionally high levels of heparan sulfate in the plasma, but the accumulation of substrates is not caused by a decrease in the activity of any lysosomal enzymes. Here, we discuss the pathomechanisms and symptoms of MPSPS, comparing them to those of MPS. Moreover, we asked the question whether MPSPS should be classified as a type of MPS or a separate disease, as contrary to 'classical' MPS types, despite GAG accumulation, no defects in lysosomal enzymes responsible for degradation of these compounds could be detected in MPSPS. The molecular mechanism of the appearance of GAG accumulation in MPSPS is suggested on the basis of results available in the literature.",

Despite having potentially life-threatening toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, the benefits of CAR T-cell therapy far outweigh these risks, particularly as increased experience and improved supportive care measures are mitigating these toxicities. CAR T cells can result in complete remission for significant proportion of patients with relapsed and refractory B-ALL and permit them to proceed to potentially curative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). CAR T cells may also be curative by themselves. Herein lie the greatest challenges and questions for clinical investigators, specifically, how are CAR T cells best employed and how do we overcome mechanisms of resistance to them? The primary clinical question is the timing and even the necessity of allo-HSCT. Relative to resistance, we know that target antigen loss, specifically CD19, is a major contributor to resistance. However, current investigations of alternative targets, such CD22, and CAR T cells expressing dual targeting antigen receptors have demonstrated encouraging initial results and provide a high degree of optimism that the efficacy and the broader application of CAR T-cell therapy will gradually increase in B-ALL. That optimism is not as high and the challenges are increased for the application of CAR T cells in T-cell leukemias and acute myeloid leukemia due to the relative lack of suitable leukemia surface targets that are not also expressed on normal hematopoietic progenitors. Despite these significant challenges, considerable research is being conducted into the development of CAR T cells for these diseases utilizing unique technologies, which may be applicable to other diseases.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although general definitions of the sepsis continuum have been published for adults, no such work has been done for the pediatric population. Physiologic and laboratory variables used to define the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and organ dysfunction require modification for the developmental stages of children. An international panel of 20 experts in sepsis and clinical research from five countries (Canada, France, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States) was convened to modify the published adult consensus definitions of infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction for children. DESIGN: Consensus conference. METHODS: This document describes the issues surrounding consensus on four major questions addressed at the meeting: a) How should the pediatric age groups affected by sepsis be delineated? b) What are the specific definitions of pediatric SIRS, infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock? c) What are the specific definitions of pediatric organ failure and the validity of pediatric organ failure scores? d) What are the appropriate study populations and study end points required to successfully conduct clinical trials in pediatric sepsis? Five subgroups first met separately and then together to evaluate the following areas: signs and symptoms of sepsis, cell markers, cytokines, microbiological data, and coagulation variables. All conference participants approved the final draft of the proceedings of the meeting. RESULTS: Conference attendees modified the current criteria used to define SIRS and sepsis in adults to incorporate pediatric physiologic variables appropriate for the following subcategories of children: newborn, neonate, infant, child, and adolescent. In addition, the SIRS definition was modified so that either criteria for fever or white blood count had to be met. We also defined various organ dysfunction categories, severe sepsis, and septic shock specifically for children. Although no firm conclusion was made regarding a single appropriate study end point, a novel nonmortality end point, organ failure-free days, was considered optimal for pediatric clinical trials given the relatively low incidence of mortality in pediatric sepsis compared with adult populations. CONCLUSION: We modified the adult SIRS criteria for children. In addition, we revised definitions of severe sepsis and septic shock for the pediatric population. Our goal is for these first-generation pediatric definitions and criteria to facilitate the performance of successful clinical studies in children with sepsis.",

METHODS: We examined the frequency of reported AEs by male research participants compared with AEs reported in prescribing information of approved female hormonal contraceptive methods. Published data from trials of the top five most-used female hormonal contraceptives, supplemented by contemporary contraceptive research, were compared with the frequency of AEs reported in a male injectable hormonal contraceptive trial. RESULTS: We observed similar frequencies of AEs reported by users of male contraceptives compared with those reported by female users. Among quantitatively comparable AEs, compared with men, women reported experiencing higher frequencies of headaches, pelvic pain, and weight gain and similar frequencies of decreased libido. Compared with women, men reported experiencing higher frequencies of acne and mood changes. Men discontinued participation due to AEs at a lower frequency than women. CONCLUSIONS: Female hormonal methods generally have similar frequencies of AEs to those reported in a recent male hormonal contraceptive trial, and male users had lower rates of discontinuation due to AEs. There were fewer serious AEs of the male contraceptive than reported in contemporary female trials which resulted in FDA licensure. This suggests there may be implicit bias in the scientific community regarding the level of acceptable risk for users of male contraceptive methods.",

        "abstract": "The general interest in the availability of male contraceptives is on the increase across different cultures and ethnic backgrounds, due in part to the fact that men are now willing more than ever, to share the responsibility of family planning. Despite the expression of interest and tremendous advances in research however, a modern male hormonal contraceptive method has remained an elusive goal. Testosterone (T) alone, or in combination with a progestin currently provides the most promising lead to male hormonal contraception. The principle relies on enhanced negative feedback of exogenous T to suppress gonadotropins, thereby blocking the endocrine stimulus for the process of spermatogenesis. A serious drawback is the inconsistent suppression among men of different ethnic backgrounds. This has increased the quest for development to include other nonhormonal methods. In reality many obstacles still have to be overcome before an acceptable method is available. In this review, we highlight recent developments in male hormonal contraceptives methods. Based on our recent findings from animal experiment, we shed light on why the method is not achieving the intended results, and suggest possible ways forward.",

        "title": "rapidGSEA: Speeding up gene set enrichment analysis on multi-core CPUs and CUDA-enabled GPUs.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a popular method to reveal significant dependencies between predefined sets of gene symbols and observed phenotypes by evaluating the deviation of gene expression values between cases and controls. An established measure of inter-class deviation, the enrichment score, is usually computed using a weighted running sum statistic over the whole set of gene symbols. Due to the lack of analytic expressions the significance of enrichment scores is determined using a non-parametric estimation of their null distribution by permuting the phenotype labels of the probed patients. Accordingly, GSEA is a time-consuming task due to the large number of required permutations to accurately estimate the nominal p-value - a circumstance that is even more pronounced during multiple hypothesis testing since its estimate is lower-bounded by the inverse number of samples in permutation space. RESULTS: We present rapidGSEA - a software suite consisting of two tools for facilitating permutation-based GSEA: cudaGSEA and ompGSEA. cudaGSEA is a CUDA-accelerated tool using fine-grained parallelization schemes on massively parallel architectures while ompGSEA is a coarse-grained multi-threaded tool for multi-core CPUs. Nominal p-value estimation of 4,725 gene sets on a data set consisting of 20,639 unique gene symbols and 200 patients (183 cases + 17 controls) each probing one million permutations takes 19 hours on a Xeon CPU and less than one hour on a GeForce Titan X GPU while the established GSEA tool from the Broad Institute (broadGSEA) takes roughly 13 days. CONCLUSION: cudaGSEA outperforms broadGSEA by around two orders-of-magnitude on a single Tesla K40c or GeForce Titan X GPU. ompGSEA provides around one order-of-magnitude speedup to broadGSEA on a standard Xeon CPU. The rapidGSEA suite is open-source software and can be downloaded at https://github.com/gravitino/cudaGSEA as standalone application or package for the R framework.",

The median GMSPS was 3 in survivors and 8 in non-survivors. A GMSPS > or = 8 was significantly associated with death (p = 0.0001) with a mortality predictivity and specificity of 70% and 92.5%, respectively. The median PRISM score in survivors was 5.5 and 23 in non-survivors. A PRISM score of > or = 11 was significantly related to death (p < 0.0001).

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to derive a novel prognostic score for mortality in paediatric meningococcal sepsis (MS) based on readily available laboratory markers. METHODS: A multicentre retrospective cohort study for the consortium set and a single centre retrospective study for replication set. The consortium set were 1,073 children (age 1 week to 17.9 years) referred over a 15-year period (1996 to 2011), who had an admission diagnosis of MS, referred to paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in six different European centres. The consortium set was split into a development set and validation set to derive the score. The replication set were 134 children with MS (age 2 weeks to 16 years) referred over a 4-year period (2007 to 2011) to PICUs via the Children's Acute Transport Service (CATS), London. RESULTS: A total of 85/1,073 (7.9%) children in the consortium set died. A total of 16/134 (11.9%) children in the replication set died. Children dying in the consortium set had significantly lower base excess, C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet and white cell count, more deranged coagulation and higher lactate than survivors. Paediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) score, Glasgow meningococcal septicaemia prognosis score (GMSPS) and Rotterdam score were also higher. Using the consortium set, a new scoring system using base excess and platelet count at presentation, termed the BEP score, was mathematically developed and validated. BEP predicted mortality with high sensitivity and specificity scores (area under the curve (AUC) in the validation set=0.86 and in the replication set=0.96). In the validation set, BEP score performance (AUC=0.86, confidence interval (CI): 0.80 to 0.91) was better than GMSPS (AUC=0.77, CI: 0.68, 0.85), similar to Rotterdam (AUC=0.87, CI: 0.81 to 0.93) and not as good as PRISM (AUC=0.93, CI: 0.85 to 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: The BEP score, relying on only two variables that are quickly and objectively measurable and readily available at presentation, is highly sensitive and specific in predicting death from MS in childhood.",

The recently established therapeutic targeting of B cells in MS patients using CD20 monoclonal antibodies (CD20-mAbs) not only profoundly suppresses inflammatory disease activity but also materializes as the first treatment approach against disability accumulation in a subset of patients with primary progressive MS. AREAS COVERED: We will review current concepts regarding the immunopathology of B cells as well as results of clinical trials with CD20-mAbs in MS, from the murine-human chimeras rituximab and ublituximab to their increasingly humanized counterparts ocrelizumab and ofatumumab. We conducted a literature search using PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov, and clinicaltrialsregister.eu. We will focus on studies emphasizing the effectiveness of these mAbs in reducing MS disease activity and progression, long-term safety, optimal dosage and maintenance regimens. Lastly, we will turn to outstanding questions regarding anti-CD20 therapy in MS. EXPERT OPINION: CD20-mAbs could become first-line drugs in selected patients with highly active MS and already constitute an option for PPMS. Future studies could evaluate whether administration regimens currently in use can be optimized, while registry data could shed light on risk versus benefits on the long run, considering immunosenescence and a potentially increased risk of malignancies and infections in an aging population.",

In order to define more appropriate targets for innovative pharmacological therapies for disruptive/conduct disorders, the European Commission within the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) funded the MATRICS project (Multidisciplinary Approaches to Translational Research in Conduct Syndromes) to identify neural, genetic, and molecular factors underpinning the pathogenesis of aggression/antisocial behavior in preclinical models and clinical samples. Within the program, a multicentre case-control study, followed by a single-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, randomized acute single-dose medication challenge, was conducted at two Italian sites. Aggressive children and adolescents with conduct disorder (CD) or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) were compared to the same age (10-17 y) typically developing controls (TDC) on a neuropsychological tasks battery that included both \"cold\" (e.g., inhibitory control, decision making) and \"hot\" executive functions (e.g., moral judgment, emotion processing, risk assessment). Selected autonomic measures (heart rate variability, skin conductance, salivary cortisol) were recorded before/during/after neuropsychological testing sessions. The acute response to different drugs (methylphenidate/atomoxetine, risperidone/aripiprazole, or placebo) was also examined in the ODD/CD cohort in order to identify potential neuropsychological/physiological mechanisms underlying aggression.

        "abstract": "Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas define a spectrum of disorders associated with T-lymphocytic proliferation with clinical manifestations occurring in the skin during the course of the disease. This review has dealt with two rather uncommon disorders, namely mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome which are indolent malignant lymphomas, occurring primarily in the fifth decade, and affecting males most frequently. Historically, mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome have been described for a relatively short time. As witnessed by Table 2, little was known concerning these disorders, other than clinical and pathologic features, until the application of immunologic, cell biologic, and cytogenetic technology which burgeoned a multitude of questions. The discovery of TCGF has allowed for both continuous growth of normal and neoplastic T cells and for the clonal expansion of some malignant clones. The establishment of these continuous cultures allowed for: (1) investigation of the mechanism of TCGF production and stimulation of T-cell growth, and (2) identification of HTLV, a retrovirus found in cell cultures from two patients with CTCL, and subsequently from patients with Japanese adult T-cell lymphoma. In addition, the HTLV has been related to a more virulent form of T-cell malignancy. The exact etiologic role of this virus in the CTCL is presently the subject of intense investigation. Through the use of immunologic methods the malignant cell of CTCL has been pheno-typically and functionally characterized as a \"helper/inducer\" subtype (E rosette+, anti-T-cell antisera+, T11+, T1+, T3+, 3A1-, T6-, T8-) and usually Ia-, HLADR-. Clinical manifestations of the phenotype may be clinically apparent in the serologic abnormalities present in these disorders. Utilizing these methods to investigate these disorders may provide a key to the understanding of T-cell function and cellular immunity much as myeloma provided a model for the understanding of B cells and immunity. Clinically and pathologically, these disorders behave as malignant indolent lymphomas with spread from localized cutaneous lesions to extracutaneous involvement of the blood, lymph nodes, and viscera culminating in the death of the patient from either organ dysfunction or infectious complications. At autopsy, this extracutaneous involvement is more pronounced than what was expected ante-mortem. Application of prospective staging techniques employing such special procedures as E-rosette cytology, cytogenetics, and electron microscopy in addition to usual light microscopy studies has demonstrated a greater percentage of extracutaneous involvement than otherwise expected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

This new disease entity was described as mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome (MPSPS). The name of the disease indicates that in addition to the typical symptoms of conventional MPS, patients develop other features such as congenital heart defects and kidney and hematopoietic system disorders. The symptoms are highly advanced, and patients usually do not survive past the second year of life. MPSPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a homozygous-specific mutation in the gene encoding the VPS33A protein. To date, it has been described in 41 patients. Patients with MPSPS exhibited excessive excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the urine and exceptionally high levels of heparan sulfate in the plasma, but the accumulation of substrates is not caused by a decrease in the activity of any lysosomal enzymes. Here, we discuss the pathomechanisms and symptoms of MPSPS, comparing them to those of MPS. Moreover, we asked the question whether MPSPS should be classified as a type of MPS or a separate disease, as contrary to 'classical' MPS types, despite GAG accumulation, no defects in lysosomal enzymes responsible for degradation of these compounds could be detected in MPSPS. The molecular mechanism of the appearance of GAG accumulation in MPSPS is suggested on the basis of results available in the literature.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

We aimed to profile the expression signature of three inflammation-related lncRNAs, MALAT1, ANRIL, and HHOTAIR, in the plasma of neonates with sepsis and correlate these signatures with the phenotype. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This case-control study included 124 neonates with sepsis (88 survivors/36 non-survivors) admitted to the neonatal ICU and 17 healthy neonates. The relative expressions were quantified by real-time PCR and correlated to the clinic-laboratory data. RESULTS: The three circulating lncRNAs were upregulated in the cases; the median levels were MALAT1 (median = 1.71, IQR: -0.5 to 3.27), ANRIL (median = 1.09, IQR: 0.89 to 1.30), and HOTAIR (median = 1.83, IQR: 1.44 to 2.41).

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is unmet need for male contraceptive options, but a recent injectable combination male contraceptive trial was terminated early due to adverse events (AEs). METHODS: We examined the frequency of reported AEs by male research participants compared with AEs reported in prescribing information of approved female hormonal contraceptive methods. Published data from trials of the top five most-used female hormonal contraceptives, supplemented by contemporary contraceptive research, were compared with the frequency of AEs reported in a male injectable hormonal contraceptive trial. RESULTS: We observed similar frequencies of AEs reported by users of male contraceptives compared with those reported by female users. Among quantitatively comparable AEs, compared with men, women reported experiencing higher frequencies of headaches, pelvic pain, and weight gain and similar frequencies of decreased libido. Compared with women, men reported experiencing higher frequencies of acne and mood changes. Men discontinued participation due to AEs at a lower frequency than women. CONCLUSIONS: Female hormonal methods generally have similar frequencies of AEs to those reported in a recent male hormonal contraceptive trial, and male users had lower rates of discontinuation due to AEs. There were fewer serious AEs of the male contraceptive than reported in contemporary female trials which resulted in FDA licensure. This suggests there may be implicit bias in the scientific community regarding the level of acceptable risk for users of male contraceptive methods.",

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has become the standard of care for children and young adults with relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and it is a highly promising therapy under investigation for adults with relapsed disease. Despite having potentially life-threatening toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, the benefits of CAR T-cell therapy far outweigh these risks, particularly as increased experience and improved supportive care measures are mitigating these toxicities. CAR T cells can result in complete remission for significant proportion of patients with relapsed and refractory B-ALL and permit them to proceed to potentially curative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). CAR T cells may also be curative by themselves. Herein lie the greatest challenges and questions for clinical investigators, specifically, how are CAR T cells best employed and how do we overcome mechanisms of resistance to them? The primary clinical question is the timing and even the necessity of allo-HSCT. Relative to resistance, we know that target antigen loss, specifically CD19, is a major contributor to resistance. However, current investigations of alternative targets, such CD22, and CAR T cells expressing dual targeting antigen receptors have demonstrated encouraging initial results and provide a high degree of optimism that the efficacy and the broader application of CAR T-cell therapy will gradually increase in B-ALL. That optimism is not as high and the challenges are increased for the application of CAR T cells in T-cell leukemias and acute myeloid leukemia due to the relative lack of suitable leukemia surface targets that are not also expressed on normal hematopoietic progenitors. Despite these significant challenges, considerable research is being conducted into the development of CAR T cells for these diseases utilizing unique technologies, which may be applicable to other diseases.",

        "abstract": "Aggressive behaviors and disruptive/conduct disorders are some of the commonest reasons for referral to youth mental health services; nevertheless, the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in real-world clinical practice remains unclear. In order to define more appropriate targets for innovative pharmacological therapies for disruptive/conduct disorders, the European Commission within the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) funded the MATRICS project (Multidisciplinary Approaches to Translational Research in Conduct Syndromes) to identify neural, genetic, and molecular factors underpinning the pathogenesis of aggression/antisocial behavior in preclinical models and clinical samples. Within the program, a multicentre case-control study, followed by a single-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, randomized acute single-dose medication challenge, was conducted at two Italian sites. Aggressive children and adolescents with conduct disorder (CD) or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) were compared to the same age (10-17 y) typically developing controls (TDC) on a neuropsychological tasks battery that included both \"cold\" (e.g., inhibitory control, decision making) and \"hot\" executive functions (e.g., moral judgment, emotion processing, risk assessment). Selected autonomic measures (heart rate variability, skin conductance, salivary cortisol) were recorded before/during/after neuropsychological testing sessions. The acute response to different drugs (methylphenidate/atomoxetine, risperidone/aripiprazole, or placebo) was also examined in the ODD/CD cohort in order to identify potential neuropsychological/physiological mechanisms underlying aggression.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Featuring demyelination and axonal degeneration, multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system representing a prominent cause of disability in young adults. The recently established therapeutic targeting of B cells in MS patients using CD20 monoclonal antibodies (CD20-mAbs) not only profoundly suppresses inflammatory disease activity but also materializes as the first treatment approach against disability accumulation in a subset of patients with primary progressive MS. AREAS COVERED: We will review current concepts regarding the immunopathology of B cells as well as results of clinical trials with CD20-mAbs in MS, from the murine-human chimeras rituximab and ublituximab to their increasingly humanized counterparts ocrelizumab and ofatumumab. We conducted a literature search using PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov, and clinicaltrialsregister.eu. We will focus on studies emphasizing the effectiveness of these mAbs in reducing MS disease activity and progression, long-term safety, optimal dosage and maintenance regimens. Lastly, we will turn to outstanding questions regarding anti-CD20 therapy in MS. EXPERT OPINION: CD20-mAbs could become first-line drugs in selected patients with highly active MS and already constitute an option for PPMS. Future studies could evaluate whether administration regimens currently in use can be optimized, while registry data could shed light on risk versus benefits on the long run, considering immunosenescence and a potentially increased risk of malignancies and infections in an aging population.",

        "title": "rapidGSEA: Speeding up gene set enrichment analysis on multi-core CPUs and CUDA-enabled GPUs.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a popular method to reveal significant dependencies between predefined sets of gene symbols and observed phenotypes by evaluating the deviation of gene expression values between cases and controls. An established measure of inter-class deviation, the enrichment score, is usually computed using a weighted running sum statistic over the whole set of gene symbols. Due to the lack of analytic expressions the significance of enrichment scores is determined using a non-parametric estimation of their null distribution by permuting the phenotype labels of the probed patients. Accordingly, GSEA is a time-consuming task due to the large number of required permutations to accurately estimate the nominal p-value - a circumstance that is even more pronounced during multiple hypothesis testing since its estimate is lower-bounded by the inverse number of samples in permutation space. RESULTS: We present rapidGSEA - a software suite consisting of two tools for facilitating permutation-based GSEA: cudaGSEA and ompGSEA. cudaGSEA is a CUDA-accelerated tool using fine-grained parallelization schemes on massively parallel architectures while ompGSEA is a coarse-grained multi-threaded tool for multi-core CPUs. Nominal p-value estimation of 4,725 gene sets on a data set consisting of 20,639 unique gene symbols and 200 patients (183 cases + 17 controls) each probing one million permutations takes 19 hours on a Xeon CPU and less than one hour on a GeForce Titan X GPU while the established GSEA tool from the Broad Institute (broadGSEA) takes roughly 13 days. CONCLUSION: cudaGSEA outperforms broadGSEA by around two orders-of-magnitude on a single Tesla K40c or GeForce Titan X GPU. ompGSEA provides around one order-of-magnitude speedup to broadGSEA on a standard Xeon CPU. The rapidGSEA suite is open-source software and can be downloaded at https://github.com/gravitino/cudaGSEA as standalone application or package for the R framework.",

        "abstract": "Vestibular migraine (VM) is the most common cause of spontaneous vertigo but remains poorly understood. We investigated the hypothesis that central vestibular pathways are sensitized in VM by measuring self-motion perceptual thresholds in patients and control subjects and by characterizing the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and vestibular and headache symptom severity. VM patients were abnormally sensitive to roll tilt, which co-modulates semicircular canal and otolith organ activity, but not to motions that activate the canals or otolith organs in isolation, implying sensitization of canal-otolith integration. When tilt thresholds were considered together with vestibular symptom severity or VOR dynamics, VM patients segregated into two clusters. Thresholds in one cluster correlated positively with symptoms and with the VOR time constant; thresholds in the second cluster were uniformly low and independent of symptoms and the time constant. The VM threshold abnormality showed a frequency-dependence that paralleled the brain stem velocity storage mechanism. These results support a pathogenic model where vestibular symptoms emanate from the vestibular nuclei, which are sensitized by migraine-related brainstem regions and simultaneously suppressed by inhibitory feedback from the cerebellar nodulus and uvula, the site of canal-otolith integration. This conceptual framework elucidates VM pathophysiology and could potentially facilitate its diagnosis and treatment.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis contributes to great mortality and morbidity among very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants. Prevalence and pathogen distribution of sepsis in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) vary with time and geographic location. Such information serves as a guide for selection of empirical antibiotics coverage. METHODS: This is a case series study performed by retrospective chart review of VLBW infants (birth body weight, BBW, <1500 g) in a medical center during a 5-year period from January 2005 to December 2009. Episodes of positive blood cultures, pathogen distribution and related clinical manifestations were described. RESULTS: A total of 158 episodes of sepsis were identified from 1042 VLBW infants. Sepsis rate was 152 per 1000 live births. The vast majority of infections (60.7%) were caused by Gram-positive organisms [G(+)], and overall Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (52.5%) were the most common pathogen identified. Prevalence for early-onset sepsis (EOS) was 1% and for late-onset sepsis (LOS) was 14.2%. Infants with EOS had a much higher case fatality rate than LOS (40% vs. 4.7%). Escherichia coli (40%) were the leading pathogen of EOS while CoNS (54.7%) was the leading pathogens of LOS. Overall, apnea and/or bradycardia and/or cyanosis (65.8%), poor activity (48.7%), and increased respiratory effort (43.0%) were the most common presenting features of sepsis. CONCLUSION: Unlike term infants, Gram-negative organism and E coli were the leading pathogen of EOS among VLBW infants. Judicious and timely use of antibiotic therapy is crucial in the care of VLBW infants.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sexual risk behavior in patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) is supposed to be associated with traumatic experiences and dissociative symptoms. Nevertheless, scientific research thereon is scarce which might be due to the high prevalence of sexual trauma and fear of overwhelming patients with explicit sexual content. METHODS: We investigated a clinical sample of patients diagnosed with BPD (n\u2009=\u2009114) and compared them to a sample of matched healthy controls (HC) (n\u2009=\u2009114) concerning the dissociative symptoms derealization, depersonalization, and conversion in sexual situations. In a subgroup of patients with BPD (n\u2009=\u200941) and matched HC (n\u2009=\u200940) dissociative symptoms after exposure to an acoustically presented erotic narrative were assessed in the lab. Regression analyses were used to examine the associations between sexual trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dissociation in sexual situations, and risky sexual behavior. RESULTS: Patients diagnosed with BPD endorsed higher dissociative symptoms in sexual situations retrospectively and in the lab compared to HC. Regression analyses revealed that depersonalization and conversion symptoms in sexual situations were explained by severity of BPD, while derealization was explained by PTSD symptomatology. Impulsive and sexual behavior with an uncommitted partner were higher in the BPD group and explained by derealization, while conversion showed an inverse association. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the importance of addressing distinct dissociative symptoms in sexual situations when counselling and treating women with BPD. In the long term, this could contribute to a reduction in sexual risk behavior in patients with BPD.

        "abstract": "Recent studies have indicated the pernicious nature of dysthymia; its low-grade chronicity probably contributes most to the problem of under-treatment and misdiagnosis. A high prevalence of morbidity and comorbidity is associated with dysthymia: major depression, alcoholism, anxiety and personality disorders are present in the vast majority of sufferers. It is also very unusual for people with dysthymia to not develop superimposed episodes of major depressive disorder, resulting in a longer time to recover and high rates of recurrence and chronicity. Approximately 3.1% of the population have dysthymia including children and adolescents who, like adults, exhibit a higher risk for new episodes of depressive illness if they have this disorder. Children and adolescents with depressive illnesses have higher rates of scholastic failure and school-related problems. Dysthymia can affect every aspect of a person's quality of life including relationships with significant others, earning potential and, most importantly, mental and physical well-being. Available data is not yet sufficient to differentiate dysthymia as a disease entity from the other depressive disorders such as major depression or double depression, or to conclude to what extent dysthymia should be thought of as a personality disorder. However, the DSM-IV Mood Disorders Field Trial results help identify new criteria for the DSM-IV Appendix. The relationship between dysthymic disorder and major depression needs more definition, especially in regard to course and severity, so that an accurate diagnosis can lead to expeditious and appropriate treatment.",

        "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, still represents one of the most common causes of persisting disability with an early disease onset. Growing evidence suggests B cells to play a crucial role in its pathogenesis and progression. Over the last decades, monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against the surface protein CD20 have been intensively studied as a B cell targeting therapy in relapsing MS (RMS) as well as primary progressive MS (PPMS). Pivotal studies on anti-CD20 therapy in RMS showed remarkable clinical and radiological effects, especially on acute inflammation and relapse biology. These results paved the way for further research on the implication of B cells in the pathogenesis of MS. Besides controlling relapse development in RMS, ocrelizumab (OCR) also showed clinical benefits in patients with PPMS and became the first approved drug for this disease course. In this review, we provide an overview of the current anti-CD20 mabs used or tested for the treatment of MS-namely rituximab (RTX), OCR, ofatumumab (OFA), and ublituximab (UB). Besides their effectiveness, we also discuss possible limitations and safety concerns especially in regard to long-term treatment, both for this class of drugs overall as well as for each anti-CD20 mab individually. Additionally, we elucidate to what extent anti-CD20 therapy may alter the function of other immune cells, both directly or indirectly.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among pediatric patients throughout the world. The varying microbiological pattern of sepsis warrants the need for researches on the causative organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. The epidemiology of neonatal and pediatric sepsis in Ethiopia is under-research. The objective of this study was to evaluate the burden of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among children suspected of sepsis. METHODS: An institutional-based prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 370 pediatric(age birth-15 years) patients suspected of sepsis at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized hospital from December 2020 to November 2021. Blood samples were collected aseptically and inoculated into Tryptone Soya Broth for culture. The organisms grown were identified by standard microbiological methods and subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing by modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method recommended by Clinical laboratory and standard institute. Methicillin resistance was confirmed using Cefoxitin disk diffusion method. Data entry and analysis were done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 software. A p-value less than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval was considered statically significant. RESULTS: Out of the total 370 study subjects, 21.6% (80/370) of them were culture positive. Of these, 43 (53.8%) and 37 (46.3%) were Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, respectively. The most prevalent Gram-positive bacterial isolate was Staphylococcus aureus (n\u2009=\u200924; 30%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (n\u2009=\u20097; 8.8%). Among the Gram-negative bacterial isolates, the leading bacteria was Klebsiella pneumoniae (n\u2009=\u200920; 25%) followed by Escherichia coli (n\u2009=\u20097; 8.8%). Clindamycin, Chloramphenicol, Gentamicin and Ciprofloxacin were the most effective antibiotics against Gram-positive bacterial isolates while Amikacin, Meropenem and Chloramphenicol were effective against Gram-negative pathogens. Methicillin resistance was detected in 45.8% of Staphylococcus aureus. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was observed in 76% of the bacterial isolates. CONCLUSION: Gram positive bacteria were the predominant isolates among pediatric sepsis cases and most of the bacterial isolates showed MDR. Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were frequently isolated bacteria. The high prevalence of drug resistance warrants rational use of antibiotics and the need for regular antibiotic susceptibility surveillance studies.",

A review of the psychiatric aspects of cannabis use is given, and the clinical signs of 70 cases of cannabis psychoses collected in Sweden are described. The bluntness and \"amotivation\" following chronic cannabis use are discussed. Anxiety reactions, flashbacks, dysphoric reactions and an abstinence syndrome are all sequels of cannabis use. Three risk groups begin to emerge: a) Young teenage cannabis users who lose some of their capacity to learn complex functions and who flee from reality to a world of dreams. With its sedative effect, cannabis could modify such emotions as anger and anxiety and slow down the liberation process of adolescence. b) Heavy daily users, often persons who cannot cope with depression or their life circumstances. c) Psychiatric patients whose resistance to relapses into psychotic reactions might be diminished according to the psychotropic effects of cannabis.",

        "title": "Timing of parental depression on risk of child depression and poor educational outcomes: A population based routine data cohort study from Born in Wales, UK.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal depression is a risk factor for depression in children, though the influence of paternal depression has been less well examined. We examined the association between maternal and paternal depression, and the timing of their depression (before or after the child's birth) and outcomes for the child including incidence of child depression and poor educational attainment. METHODS: A linked routine data cohort study linking General Practitioner(GP), hospital and education records of young people (aged 0 to 30 years) in Wales. Parental and child diagnosis of depression was identified from GP data. Regression analysis examined the association of maternal and paternal depression with time to diagnosis of depression in the child and odds of attaining educational milestones. OUTCOMES: In adjusted models, the relative risk of offspring developing depression was 1.22 if the mother had depression before the child was born, 1.55 if the mother had depression after the child was born and 1.73 if she had depression both before and after the child was born (chronic depression), compared to those were there was no maternal depression history. For achieving milestones at end of primary school, odds were 0.92, 0.88 and 0.79 respectively. Association of depression in the child was similar if the male living in the household had depression with risk ratios of 1.24 (before), 1.43 (after) and 1.27 (before and after) for child diagnosed depression and 0.85, 0.79 and 0.74 for achieving age 11 milestones. INTERPRETATION: Children who live with a parent who has depression are more likely to develop depression and not achieve educational milestones, compared to children who live with a parent who has a history of depression (but no active depression in child's lifetime) and compared to those with no depression. This finding suggests that working closely with families where depression (particularly chronic depression) is present in either parent and treating parental depression to remission is likely to have long-term benefits for children's mental health and educational attainment.",

This enzymatic process can be wholly dissolved. If adequate amounts of vitamin K are absent or anticoagulant drugs are administered, this process will be incomplete and abnormal proteins will appear in the blood. Recently, it was found that this carboxylation is blocked by the antibiotics having the N-methyltetrazolethiol group. These antibiotics inhibit vitamin K epoxide reductase, stop the recycling of vitamin K and cause vitamin K deficiency.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a microarray data analysis method that uses predefined gene sets and ranks of genes to identify significant biological changes in microarray data sets. GSEA is especially useful when gene expression changes in a given microarray data set is minimal or moderate. RESULTS: We developed a modified gene set enrichment analysis method based on a parametric statistical analysis model. Compared with GSEA, the parametric analysis of gene set enrichment (PAGE) detected a larger number of significantly altered gene sets and their p-values were lower than the corresponding p-values calculated by GSEA. Because PAGE uses normal distribution for statistical inference, it requires less computation than GSEA, which needs repeated computation of the permutated data set. PAGE was able to detect significantly changed gene sets from microarray data irrespective of different Affymetrix probe level analysis methods or different microarray platforms. Comparison of two aged muscle microarray data sets at gene set level using PAGE revealed common biological themes better than comparison at individual gene level. CONCLUSION: PAGE was statistically more sensitive and required much less computational effort than GSEA, it could identify significantly changed biological themes from microarray data irrespective of analysis methods or microarray platforms, and it was useful in comparison of multiple microarray data sets. We offer PAGE as a useful microarray analysis method.",

The results indicated that the depressed children were like depressed adults in that they reported experiencing a pattern of emotions including sadness, anger, self-directed hostility, and shame, and they tended to explain negative events in terms of internal, stable, and global causes. The similarity between depressed children and depressed adults on these measures was greater for girls than for boys. Depression was not related to performance on a verbal task, but depressed girls performed worse than nondepressed girls on a block design task.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effect of neonatal treatment with kaempferol on neuromotor development, proliferation of neural precursor cells, the microglia profile, and antioxidant enzyme gene expression in the hippocampus. METHODS: A rat model of cerebral palsy was established using perinatal anoxia and sensorimotor restriction of hindlimbs during infancy. Kaempferol (1\u2005mg/ kg) was intraperitoneally administered during the neonatal period. RESULTS: Neonatal treatment with kaempferol reduces the impact of the cerebral palsy model on reflex ontogeny and on the maturation of physical features. Impairment of locomotor activity development and motor coordination was found to be attenuated by kaempferol treatment during the neonatal period in rats exposed to cerebral palsy. Neonatal treatment of kaempferol in cerebral palsy rats prevents a substantial reduction in the number of neural precursor cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, an activated microglia profile, and increased proliferation of microglia in the sub-granular zone and in the granular cell layer. Neonatal treatment with kaempferol increases gene expression of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the hippocampus of rats submitted to the cerebral palsy model. DISCUSSION: Kaempferol attenuates the impact of cerebral palsy on neuromotor behavior development, preventing altered hippocampal microglia activation and mitigating impaired cell proliferation in a neurogenic niche in these rats. Neonatal treatment with kaempferol also increases antioxidant defense gene expression in the hippocampus of rats submitted to the cerebral palsy model.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a major complaint of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. However, little is known about its pathophysiological mechanisms. Evidence from chronic fatigue syndrome and studies on sickness behaviour suggest that immune and neuroendocrine factors may play a causative role in the development of fatigue. METHODS: We compared whole blood stimulatory capacity for pro- (TNFalpha, IFNgamma) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) as well as hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function in 15 MS patients with marked fatigue and 15 patients without fatigue as determined by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). RESULTS: Proinflammatory cytokines were significantly higher (TNFalpha: 478.9 v 228.2 pg/ml, p = 0.01; IFNgamma: 57.6 v 27.8 pg/ml; p = 0.01) in MS patients with fatigue. Furthermore, TNFalpha values significantly correlated with daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (r = 0.64, p = 0.001). Controlling for disease activity (as measured by the Cambridge Multiple Sclerosis Basic Score), disease duration, Expanded Disability Status Scale, and depression further increased the correlation of cytokine production and fatigue. HPA axis activity was not related to fatigue but was modestly correlated with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that fatigue in MS is at least partially mediated through activation of proinflammatory cytokines. In line with earlier findings, HPA axis dysfunction seems not to be relevant in MS fatigue pathogenesis but appears to be linked to cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest that increased levels of inflammatory cytokines may be involved in MS fatigue. Investigation of cytokine profiles may increase the understanding of fatigue pathogenesis in MS.",

METHOD: Patients were recruited from the department of surgery in a large medical center in Taiwan. In this longitudinal pilot study, the Fatigue Symptom Inventory and fasting blood samples were collected at three assessments (i.e., prior to surgery (T0), three months (T1) and six months (T2) after surgery). Metabolomic profile analysis was used. Multilevel regression and pathway analyses were performed to identify differences in metabolomic profiles between the fatigued and non-fatigued groups. RESULTS: Of the 49 patients, 55.1% (n\u00a0=\u00a027) were in the fatigue group. All of the 15 metabolites that had statistically significant group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interactions in the differential metabolite analysis were entered into the pathway analysis. Two pathways were enriched for these metabolites, namely galactose metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this pilot study suggest that pathways involved in galactose metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis are associated with cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with CRC during CTX. These findings are consistent with the hypotheses that alterations in energy metabolism and increases in inflammation are associated with the development and maintenance of CRF.",

Yet we lack data in medical students who are at risk of addictive behavior. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of cannabis consumption and cannabis use disorder (CUD) among French medical students and their association with psychotropic drug consumption and psychosocial factors. Medical students were recruited from 35 French universities of medicine through administration mailing lists and social networks, between December 2016 and May 2017. Cannabis consumption was self-declared by anonymous questionnaire and CUD was defined by a Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) score\u2009\u2265\u20093. 10,985 medical students with a mean age of 21.8\u00a0years (\u00b1\u20093.3) were included, 32% of which were men. Overall, 1642 [14.9 (14.3; 15.6)%] reported cannabis consumption and 622 [5.7 (5.2; 6.1)%] students were identified with CUD at screening. Men were at two-time higher risk of cannabis consumption and three-time higher risk of CUD (22.4% and 10.6% for men vs. 11.5% and 3.4%, respectively, for women). In multivariate analyses, men sex, alcohol use disorder, tobacco smoking, parents' divorce, and history of physical assault and lower rates of lower rates of\u2009\u2265\u200940 weekly worked hours were identified as common associated factors for cannabis consumption and CUD. Hypnotic consumption, psychiatric follow-up, and history of sexual assault were identified as factors associated specifically with CUD, suggesting that these factors were associated with more severe cannabis consumption. Only 17% of students identified with CUD reported a psychiatric follow-up. Altogether, these results suggest that health policies should target cannabis consumption in medical students that is frequent, especially in men, with low rates of psychiatric follow-up. We have identified psychological factors and increased hypnotic drug consumption in CUD participants suggesting that psychiatric follow-up should be systematically proposed to this group.",

        "title": "Borderline personality features in relationship to childhood trauma in unipolar depressive and bipolar disorders.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Childhood trauma, including emotional neglect, emotional abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse, may contribute to borderline personality features like affective instability, identity problems, negative relationships, and self-harm. This study aims to explore how different types of childhood trauma affect these features in bipolar versus unipolar depressive disorders. METHODS: We included 839 participants of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) with a lifetime diagnosis of major depressive disorder single episode (MDDS; N\u00a0=\u00a0443), recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD-R; N\u00a0=\u00a0331), or bipolar disorder (BD; N\u00a0=\u00a065). Multivariate regression was used to analyze data from the Childhood Trauma Interview and borderline features (from the self-report Personality Assessment Inventory). RESULTS: On average, participants were 48.6\u00a0years old (SD: 12.6), with 69.2\u00a0% being women, and 50.3\u00a0% of participants assessed positive for childhood trauma. Adjusted analyses revealed that participants diagnosed with BD, followed by MDD-R, exhibited the highest number of borderline personality features. Additionally, within the entire group, a strong association was found between childhood trauma, especially emotional neglect, and the presence of borderline personality features. CONCLUSION: Given the high prevalence of childhood trauma and borderline personality features, screening for these factors in individuals with mood disorders is crucial. Identifying these elements can inform and enhance the management of the often fluctuating and complex nature of these comorbid conditions, leading to more effective and tailored treatment strategies.",

        "title": "Cannabis Use as a Risk Factor for Depression, Anxiety, and Suicidality: Epidemiological Associations and Implications for Nurses.",
        "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders commonly co-occur and are major public health concerns given the morbidity and mortality associated with them. Globally, cannabis is among the most commonly used drugs, and cannabis use frequently begins in adolescence or emerging adulthood, both important periods of development and periods in which psychiatric symptoms and disorders frequently emerge. Thus, the relationships between cannabis use and mental illnesses are essential for nurses and other healthcare professionals and researchers to explore and understand. This literature review examines the relationships between cannabis use and depression, anxiety, and suicide. It includes a primer on the neurobiology of cannabis effects; an overview on the epidemiological evidence on the associations between cannabis use and depression, anxiety, and suicide; and a discussion of implications for nurses, particularly important given changes in the medical and recreational cannabis legislation in North America. Overall, this review found consistent evidence showing a cross-sectional association between recreational cannabis use and depression, anxiety, and suicide, despite some limitations and conflicts in the literature. In addition, most evidence from longitudinal or case control studies suggested cannabis use preceded the development of depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors, although the quality of this evidence was mixed. Implications for future research and nursing practice are discussed.",

        "abstract": "It is estimated that 4-8% of youth in Europe carry out substantial care for a family member or significant other. To prevent adverse psychosocial outcomes in young carers (YCs), primary prevention resilience building interventions have been recommended. We describe the study protocol of an international randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an innovative group intervention designed to promote the mental health and well-being of adolescent YCs (AYCs) aged 15-17. The RCT will be conducted in six European countries in the context of the Horizon 2020 European funded research and innovation project \"Psychosocial support for promoting mental health and well-being among adolescent young caregivers in Europe\" (\"ME-WE\"). The ME-WE intervention is based on Hayes and Ciarrochi's psychoeducational model for adolescents and will consist of seven 2-h sessions in a group format, aimed to help AYCs build psychological flexibility and live according to their values. The control group will be a waitlist. Primary and secondary outcomes and control variables will be measured at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and 3 months follow-up (T2). The COVID-19 pandemic has made amendments necessary to the original study protocol methodology, which we describe in detail. This study will contribute to building an evidence-based manualized program that educators and health and social care professionals can use to support AYCs in their transition to adulthood. From a research perspective, the outcomes of this study will contribute to evidence-based practices in primary prevention of psychosocial difficulties in AYCs and will gather novel knowledge on the effectiveness of Hayes and Ciarrochi's model for use with middle adolescents with caring responsibilities. The trial has been preregistered (registration number: NCT04114864).",

Trofinetide is a synthetic analog of glycine-proline-glutamate, the N-terminal tripeptide of the insulin-like growth factor 1 protein, and has demonstrated clinical benefit in phase 2 studies in Rett syndrome. In this phase 3 study ( https://clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04181723 ), females with Rett syndrome received twice-daily oral trofinetide (n\u2009=\u200993) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200994) for 12 weeks. For the coprimary efficacy endpoints, least squares mean (LSM) change from baseline to week 12 in the Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire for trofinetide versus placebo was -4.9 versus -1.7 (P\u2009=\u20090.0175; Cohen's d effect size, 0.37), and LSM Clinical Global Impression-Improvement at week 12 was 3.5 versus 3.8 (P\u2009=\u20090.0030; effect size, 0.47).

        "abstract": "The present study examined genetic, prenatal, and postnatal environmental pathways in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and depressive symptoms from parents to early adolescents (when these symptoms start to increase), while considering timing effects of exposure to parent anxiety and depressive symptoms postnatally. The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

The clinical course of this condition is considered self-limiting and is divided into three clinical phases. Several treatment methods for adhesive capsulitis have been reported in the literature, none of which has proven superior to others. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term follow-up of patients with idiopathic adhesive capsulitis who were treated conservatively. METHODS: We conducted a long-term follow-up (range 5.5-16 years, mean 9.2 years) of 54 patients suffering from idiopathic adhesive capsulitis. All patients were treated with physical therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RESULTS: An increased statistically significant improvement (P < 0.00001) was found between the first and last visits to the clinic in all measured movement directions: elevation and external and internal rotation. CONCLUSIONS: Conservative treatment (physical therapy and NSAIDs) is a good long-term treatment regimen for idiopathic adhesive capsulitis.",

        "title": "The pyrethroids metabolite 3-phenoxybenzoic acid induces dopaminergic degeneration.",
        "abstract": "Exposure to pyrethroids, a significant class of the most widely used agricultural chemicals, has been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, although many different pyrethroids induce roughly the same symptoms of Parkinsonism, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To find the shared key features among these mechanisms, we focused on 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common and prominent metabolite of most pyrethroids produced via hydrolysis by CEs in mammals. To determine the contribution of 3-PBA to the initiation and progression of PD, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively, and found that 3-PBA not only accumulates in murine brain tissues over time but also further induces PD-like pathologies (increased \u03b1-syn and phospho-S129, decreased TH) to the same or even greater extent than the precursor pyrethroid. A before-after study of PET-DAT in the same mice revealed that low concentrations of 3-PBA (0.5 mg/kg) could paradoxically cause DAT to increase (22.46% higher than pre-drug test). The intervention of DAT inhibitors and activators respectively alleviated and enhanced the dopaminergic toxicity of 3-PBA, indicating that 3-PBA interacts with DAT. In particular, low concentrations of 3-PBA increase the DAT, which in turn induces 3-PBA to enter the dopaminergic neurons to exert toxic effects. Finally, we described a mechanism underlying this potential role of 3-PBA in the pathological aggregation of \u03b1-syn. Specifically, 3-PBA was found to dysregulate C/EBP \u03b2 levels and further anomalously activate AEP in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by increased accumulation of pathologically cleaved \u03b1-syn (N103 fragments) and accelerated \u03b1-syn aggregation. All these results suggest that 3-PBA exposure could mimic the pathological and pathogenetic features of PD, showing that this metabolite is a key pathogenic compound in pyrethroid-related pathological effects and a possible dopamine neurotoxin. Additionally, our findings provide a crucial reference for the primary prevention of PD.",

Although progress in the therapeutic field remains unsatisfactory, we have to notice that genetics have undergone impressive improvements over the last three decades and, by extension, our knowledge of ALS cases linked to a pathogenic mutation that accounts for 10% of all cases (either sporadic or familiar) and is currently called hereditary ALS (hALS). In many neurological diseases treatment targeting pathogenic genes have significatively improved the natural profile of the disease: this is perfectly illustrated for familial amyloid neuropathy and spinal muscular atrophy. Because of these findings and the urgent need to find a cure for ALS, many trials have focused on familial ALS targeting the four most important genes linked to the disease: C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS. We propose in this review an update on the perspectives of treatment that may be available in mid-term in hALS and will discuss in the last part the potential consequences for asymptomatic relatives of patients with a hALS and for ALS patients.",

A series of blood tests indicate hematopoietic symptoms including progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia, which correlate with histological observations of hypoplastic bone marrow. High urinary excretion of protein (caused by impairments in renal filtration), hypoalbuminemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, cholesterol, and uric acid indicate renal dysfunction. Histological analyses of MPSPS kidneys similarly suggest the extensive destruction of glomerular structures by foamy podocytes.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the release of the combined oral contraceptive pill in 1960, women have shouldered the burden of contraception and family planning. Over 60 years later, this is still the case as the only practical, effective contraceptive options available to men are condoms and vasectomy. However, there are now a variety of promising hormonal and non-hormonal male contraceptive options being studied. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide clinicians and laypeople with focused, up-to-date descriptions of novel strategies and targets for male contraception. We include a cautiously optimistic discussion of benefits and potential drawbacks, highlighting several methods in preclinical and clinical stages of development. RESULTS: As of June 2023, two hormonal male contraceptive methods are undergoing phase II clinical trials for safety and efficacy. A large-scale, international phase IIb trial investigating efficacy of transdermal segesterone acetate (Nestorone) plus testosterone gel has enrolled over 460 couples with completion estimated for late 2024. A second hormonal method, dimethandrolone undecanoate, is in two clinical trials focusing on safety, pharmacodynamics, suppression of spermatogenesis and hormones; the first of these two is estimated for completion in December 2024. There are also several non-hormonal methods with strong potential in preclinical stages of development. CONCLUSIONS: There exist several hurdles to novel male contraception. Therapeutic development takes decades of time, meticulous work, and financial investment, but with so many strong candidates it is our hope that there will soon be several safe, effective, and reversible contraceptive options available to male patients. R\u00e9SUM\u00e9: CONTEXTE: Depuis la sortie de la pilule contraceptive orale combin\u00e9e en 1960, les femmes ont assum\u00e9 le fardeau de la contraception et de la planification familiale. Plus de 60 ans plus tard, c\u2019est toujours le cas, car les seules options contraceptives pratiques et efficaces disponibles pour les hommes sont les pr\u00e9servatifs et la vasectomie. Cependant, il existe maintenant une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019options contraceptives masculines hormonales et non hormonales prometteuses qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude. Le but de cette revue narrative est de fournir aux cliniciens et aux profanes des descriptions cibl\u00e9es et \u00e0 jour de nouvelles strat\u00e9gies et cibles pour la contraception masculine. Nous incluons une discussion prudemment optimiste sur les avantages et les inconv\u00e9nients potentiels, en soulignant plusieurs m\u00e9thodes aux stades pr\u00e9cliniques et cliniques du d\u00e9veloppement. R\u00e9SULTATS: En juin 2023, deux m\u00e9thodes contraceptives masculines hormonales faisaient l\u2019objet d\u2019essais cliniques de phase II pour leur innocuit\u00e9 et leur efficacit\u00e9.

Une seconde m\u00e9thode hormonale, l\u2019und\u00e9canoate de dim\u00e9thandrolone, fait l\u2019objet de deux essais cliniques ax\u00e9s sur l\u2019innocuit\u00e9, la pharmacodynamique, la suppression de la spermatogen\u00e8se et des hormones; le premier de ces deux essais devrait \u00eatre achev\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 2024. Il existe \u00e9galement plusieurs m\u00e9thodes non hormonales \u00e0 fort potentiel aux stades pr\u00e9cliniques de d\u00e9veloppement. CONCLUSIONS: Il existe plusieurs obstacles \u00e0 la nouvelle contraception masculine. Le d\u00e9veloppement th\u00e9rapeutique n\u00e9cessite des d\u00e9cennies de temps, un travail m\u00e9ticuleux et un investissement financier ; mais avec autant de candidats solides, nous esp\u00e9rons qu\u2019il y aura bient\u00f4t plusieurs options contraceptives s\u00fbres, efficaces et r\u00e9versibles, disponibles pour les hommes.",

        "title": "Diverse biological functions of vitamin K: from coagulation to ferroptosis.",
        "abstract": "Vitamin K is essential for several physiological processes, such as blood coagulation, in which it serves as a cofactor for the conversion of peptide-bound glutamate to \u03b3-carboxyglutamate in vitamin K-dependent proteins. This process is driven by the vitamin K cycle facilitated by \u03b3-carboxyglutamyl carboxylase, vitamin K epoxide reductase and ferroptosis suppressor protein-1, the latter of which was recently identified as the long-sought-after warfarin-resistant vitamin K reductase. In addition, vitamin K has carboxylation-independent functions. Akin to ubiquinone, vitamin K acts as an electron carrier for ATP production in some organisms and prevents ferroptosis, a type of cell death hallmarked by lipid peroxidation. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the diverse functions of vitamin K in physiology and metabolism and, at the same time, offer a perspective on its role in ferroptosis together with ferroptosis suppressor protein-1. A comparison between vitamin K and ubiquinone, from an evolutionary perspective, may offer further insights into the manifold roles of vitamin K in biology.",

        "title": "Is trofinetide a future treatment for Rett syndrome? A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare, life-threatening, genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. Treatment in RTT encounters many challenges. Trofinetide, a modified amino-terminal tripeptide of insulin-like growth factor 1, has demonstrated clinically promising results in RTT. In this study, trofinetide efficacy and safety in RTT are systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed. METHODS: A systematic search of five electronic databases was conducted until January 2024. Review Manager 5.4 software was used for the analysis. The analysis was based on a weighted mean difference and standard error with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, and a statistically significant P-value was considered if it was\u2009<\u20090.05. The study was registered on PROSPERO with registration number CRD42024499849. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS: Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 276 patients were included in the analysis. Trofinetide improved both caregiver outcomes and clinical scales by improving the Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ) (mean difference (MD):\u2009-\u20093.46 points, 95% CI:\u2009-\u20095.63 to\u2009-\u20091.27, P\u2009=\u20090.0002) and Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I) (MD:\u2009-\u20090.35, 95% CI:\u2009-\u20090.51 to\u2009-\u20090.18, P\u2009<\u20090.0001), respectively. However, trofinetide neither improved the Caregiver Top 3 Concerns Visual Analog Scale nor the Rett Motor Behavioral Assessment. Regarding safety, trofinetide was significantly associated with vomiting compared to placebo (odds ratio (OR): 3.17, 95% CI: 1.57 to 6.43, P\u2009=\u20090.001). After solving heterogeneity, results showed a statistically significant incidence of diarrhea in the trofinetide (200\u00a0mg) group compared to placebo (OR: 18.51, 95% CI: 9.30 to 36.84, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Trofinetide demonstrated statistically significant improvements in CGI-I and RSBQ in pediatrics and adult patients with Rett. Side effects are limited to vomiting and diarrhea. Although diarrhea yielded an insignificant result in our analysis, it emerged as a cause for treatment discontinuation in the participating trials, and a statistically significant risk for diarrhea emerged when excluding the study using a lower dose of the drug, hence causing heterogeneity, in the\u00a0meta-analysis. Given the diverse genetic landscape of RTT, future RCTs investigating correlations between RTT genotype and phenotypic improvements by trofinetide will be beneficial. RCTs encompassing male patients with larger and longer cohorts are recommended.",

        "abstract": "Unconjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are an important component of effective combination therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) is a major mediator of mAb cytotoxicity, but there is limited knowledge of the determinants of ADP efficacy. We used macrophages derived in vitro from autologous circulating monocytes to test the effects of mAb structure and concentration, target : effector cell ratio, duration of co-incubation and CLL cell CD20 expression on ADP. Next-generation anti-CD20 mAbs (ofatumumab, ublituximab, obinutuzumab, ocaratuzumab) were significantly more effective at inducing ADP compared to rituximab, but none were as effective as the anti-CD52 mAb alemtuzumab. Ofatumumab (10 \u03bcg/ml) used as a representative next-generation anti-CD20 mAb achieved an ADP plateau at 3 h co-incubation with a target : effector ratio of 10 : 1 (mean = 2.1 CLL cells/macrophage, range = 1.5-3.5). At 0.156 \u03bcg/ml (the lowest concentration tested) ofatumumab ADP was significantly higher than alemtuzumab. However, ofatumumab-induced ADP did not increase significantly at higher mAb concentrations. We show that anti-CD20 mAb ADP efficacy is determined by the mAb characteristics, target : effector ratio and incubation time. We suggest that preclinical evaluation of anti-CD20\u2009mAbs to understand the determinants of ADP could be useful in designing future combination therapies for CLL.",

        "abstract": "The National Institute of Mental Health has called for translational research linking basic knowledge about vulnerabilities that underlie mood disorders to the development of effective preventive interventions. This paper highlights research about risk factors for depression in children and adolescents and links it to current knowledge about interventions aimed at preventing depression in youth. Basic epidemiologic and clinical research indicates that increased risk for depression is associated with being female; a family history of depression, particularly in a parent; subclinical depressive symptoms; anxiety; stressful life events; neurobiological dysregulation; temperament/personality (e.g., neuroticism); negative cognitions; problems in self-regulation and coping; and interpersonal dysfunction. These vulnerabilities both increase individuals' chances of encountering stress and decrease their ability to deal with the stress once it occurs. Although several existing depression-prevention studies have targeted one or more of these risk factors, the efficacy of these various prevention programs for youth with different combinations of these risk factors needs to be investigated further. Most existing depression-prevention programs in youth have used cognitive-behavioral techniques, with some success. Other depression-prevention strategies have included training in coping, social problem solving, social skills, communication skills, and parenting. A comprehensive prevention program is recommended that includes multiple intervention components, each of which addresses risk and protective factors across different domains and levels of analysis.",

GSEA is especially useful when gene expression changes in a given microarray data set is minimal or moderate. RESULTS: We developed a modified gene set enrichment analysis method based on a parametric statistical analysis model. Compared with GSEA, the parametric analysis of gene set enrichment (PAGE) detected a larger number of significantly altered gene sets and their p-values were lower than the corresponding p-values calculated by GSEA. Because PAGE uses normal distribution for statistical inference, it requires less computation than GSEA, which needs repeated computation of the permutated data set. PAGE was able to detect significantly changed gene sets from microarray data irrespective of different Affymetrix probe level analysis methods or different microarray platforms. Comparison of two aged muscle microarray data sets at gene set level using PAGE revealed common biological themes better than comparison at individual gene level. CONCLUSION: PAGE was statistically more sensitive and required much less computational effort than GSEA, it could identify significantly changed biological themes from microarray data irrespective of analysis methods or microarray platforms, and it was useful in comparison of multiple microarray data sets. We offer PAGE as a useful microarray analysis method.",

        "abstract": "The present study examined genetic, prenatal, and postnatal environmental pathways in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and depressive symptoms from parents to early adolescents (when these symptoms start to increase), while considering timing effects of exposure to parent anxiety and depressive symptoms postnatally. The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

        "abstract": "France has been identified with one of the highest rates of cannabis consumption of Western European countries. Yet we lack data in medical students who are at risk of addictive behavior. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of cannabis consumption and cannabis use disorder (CUD) among French medical students and their association with psychotropic drug consumption and psychosocial factors. Medical students were recruited from 35 French universities of medicine through administration mailing lists and social networks, between December 2016 and May 2017. Cannabis consumption was self-declared by anonymous questionnaire and CUD was defined by a Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) score\u2009\u2265\u20093. 10,985 medical students with a mean age of 21.8\u00a0years (\u00b1\u20093.3) were included, 32% of which were men. Overall, 1642 [14.9 (14.3; 15.6)%] reported cannabis consumption and 622 [5.7 (5.2; 6.1)%] students were identified with CUD at screening. Men were at two-time higher risk of cannabis consumption and three-time higher risk of CUD (22.4% and 10.6% for men vs. 11.5% and 3.4%, respectively, for women). In multivariate analyses, men sex, alcohol use disorder, tobacco smoking, parents' divorce, and history of physical assault and lower rates of lower rates of\u2009\u2265\u200940 weekly worked hours were identified as common associated factors for cannabis consumption and CUD. Hypnotic consumption, psychiatric follow-up, and history of sexual assault were identified as factors associated specifically with CUD, suggesting that these factors were associated with more severe cannabis consumption. Only 17% of students identified with CUD reported a psychiatric follow-up. Altogether, these results suggest that health policies should target cannabis consumption in medical students that is frequent, especially in men, with low rates of psychiatric follow-up. We have identified psychological factors and increased hypnotic drug consumption in CUD participants suggesting that psychiatric follow-up should be systematically proposed to this group.",

        "title": "Male contraception: narrative review of ongoing research.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the release of the combined oral contraceptive pill in 1960, women have shouldered the burden of contraception and family planning. Over 60 years later, this is still the case as the only practical, effective contraceptive options available to men are condoms and vasectomy. However, there are now a variety of promising hormonal and non-hormonal male contraceptive options being studied. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide clinicians and laypeople with focused, up-to-date descriptions of novel strategies and targets for male contraception. We include a cautiously optimistic discussion of benefits and potential drawbacks, highlighting several methods in preclinical and clinical stages of development. RESULTS: As of June 2023, two hormonal male contraceptive methods are undergoing phase II clinical trials for safety and efficacy. A large-scale, international phase IIb trial investigating efficacy of transdermal segesterone acetate (Nestorone) plus testosterone gel has enrolled over 460 couples with completion estimated for late 2024. A second hormonal method, dimethandrolone undecanoate, is in two clinical trials focusing on safety, pharmacodynamics, suppression of spermatogenesis and hormones; the first of these two is estimated for completion in December 2024. There are also several non-hormonal methods with strong potential in preclinical stages of development. CONCLUSIONS: There exist several hurdles to novel male contraception. Therapeutic development takes decades of time, meticulous work, and financial investment, but with so many strong candidates it is our hope that there will soon be several safe, effective, and reversible contraceptive options available to male patients. R\u00e9SUM\u00e9: CONTEXTE: Depuis la sortie de la pilule contraceptive orale combin\u00e9e en 1960, les femmes ont assum\u00e9 le fardeau de la contraception et de la planification familiale. Plus de 60 ans plus tard, c\u2019est toujours le cas, car les seules options contraceptives pratiques et efficaces disponibles pour les hommes sont les pr\u00e9servatifs et la vasectomie. Cependant, il existe maintenant une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019options contraceptives masculines hormonales et non hormonales prometteuses qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude. Le but de cette revue narrative est de fournir aux cliniciens et aux profanes des descriptions cibl\u00e9es et \u00e0 jour de nouvelles strat\u00e9gies et cibles pour la contraception masculine. Nous incluons une discussion prudemment optimiste sur les avantages et les inconv\u00e9nients potentiels, en soulignant plusieurs m\u00e9thodes aux stades pr\u00e9cliniques et cliniques du d\u00e9veloppement. R\u00e9SULTATS: En juin 2023, deux m\u00e9thodes contraceptives masculines hormonales faisaient l\u2019objet d\u2019essais cliniques de phase II pour leur innocuit\u00e9 et leur efficacit\u00e9.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis contributes to great mortality and morbidity among very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants. Prevalence and pathogen distribution of sepsis in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) vary with time and geographic location. Such information serves as a guide for selection of empirical antibiotics coverage. METHODS: This is a case series study performed by retrospective chart review of VLBW infants (birth body weight, BBW, <1500 g) in a medical center during a 5-year period from January 2005 to December 2009. Episodes of positive blood cultures, pathogen distribution and related clinical manifestations were described. RESULTS: A total of 158 episodes of sepsis were identified from 1042 VLBW infants. Sepsis rate was 152 per 1000 live births. The vast majority of infections (60.7%) were caused by Gram-positive organisms [G(+)], and overall Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (52.5%) were the most common pathogen identified. Prevalence for early-onset sepsis (EOS) was 1% and for late-onset sepsis (LOS) was 14.2%. Infants with EOS had a much higher case fatality rate than LOS (40% vs. 4.7%). Escherichia coli (40%) were the leading pathogen of EOS while CoNS (54.7%) was the leading pathogens of LOS. Overall, apnea and/or bradycardia and/or cyanosis (65.8%), poor activity (48.7%), and increased respiratory effort (43.0%) were the most common presenting features of sepsis. CONCLUSION: Unlike term infants, Gram-negative organism and E coli were the leading pathogen of EOS among VLBW infants. Judicious and timely use of antibiotic therapy is crucial in the care of VLBW infants.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to pyrethroids, a significant class of the most widely used agricultural chemicals, has been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, although many different pyrethroids induce roughly the same symptoms of Parkinsonism, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To find the shared key features among these mechanisms, we focused on 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common and prominent metabolite of most pyrethroids produced via hydrolysis by CEs in mammals. To determine the contribution of 3-PBA to the initiation and progression of PD, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively, and found that 3-PBA not only accumulates in murine brain tissues over time but also further induces PD-like pathologies (increased \u03b1-syn and phospho-S129, decreased TH) to the same or even greater extent than the precursor pyrethroid. A before-after study of PET-DAT in the same mice revealed that low concentrations of 3-PBA (0.5 mg/kg) could paradoxically cause DAT to increase (22.46% higher than pre-drug test). The intervention of DAT inhibitors and activators respectively alleviated and enhanced the dopaminergic toxicity of 3-PBA, indicating that 3-PBA interacts with DAT. In particular, low concentrations of 3-PBA increase the DAT, which in turn induces 3-PBA to enter the dopaminergic neurons to exert toxic effects. Finally, we described a mechanism underlying this potential role of 3-PBA in the pathological aggregation of \u03b1-syn. Specifically, 3-PBA was found to dysregulate C/EBP \u03b2 levels and further anomalously activate AEP in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by increased accumulation of pathologically cleaved \u03b1-syn (N103 fragments) and accelerated \u03b1-syn aggregation. All these results suggest that 3-PBA exposure could mimic the pathological and pathogenetic features of PD, showing that this metabolite is a key pathogenic compound in pyrethroid-related pathological effects and a possible dopamine neurotoxin. Additionally, our findings provide a crucial reference for the primary prevention of PD.",

The varying microbiological pattern of sepsis warrants the need for researches on the causative organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. The epidemiology of neonatal and pediatric sepsis in Ethiopia is under-research. The objective of this study was to evaluate the burden of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among children suspected of sepsis. METHODS: An institutional-based prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 370 pediatric(age birth-15 years) patients suspected of sepsis at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized hospital from December 2020 to November 2021. Blood samples were collected aseptically and inoculated into Tryptone Soya Broth for culture. The organisms grown were identified by standard microbiological methods and subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing by modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method recommended by Clinical laboratory and standard institute. Methicillin resistance was confirmed using Cefoxitin disk diffusion method. Data entry and analysis were done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 software. A p-value less than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval was considered statically significant. RESULTS: Out of the total 370 study subjects, 21.6% (80/370) of them were culture positive. Of these, 43 (53.8%) and 37 (46.3%) were Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, respectively. The most prevalent Gram-positive bacterial isolate was Staphylococcus aureus (n\u2009=\u200924; 30%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (n\u2009=\u20097; 8.8%). Among the Gram-negative bacterial isolates, the leading bacteria was Klebsiella pneumoniae (n\u2009=\u200920; 25%) followed by Escherichia coli (n\u2009=\u20097; 8.8%). Clindamycin, Chloramphenicol, Gentamicin and Ciprofloxacin were the most effective antibiotics against Gram-positive bacterial isolates while Amikacin, Meropenem and Chloramphenicol were effective against Gram-negative pathogens. Methicillin resistance was detected in 45.8% of Staphylococcus aureus. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was observed in 76% of the bacterial isolates. CONCLUSION: Gram positive bacteria were the predominant isolates among pediatric sepsis cases and most of the bacterial isolates showed MDR. Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were frequently isolated bacteria. The high prevalence of drug resistance warrants rational use of antibiotics and the need for regular antibiotic susceptibility surveillance studies.",

Three risk groups begin to emerge: a) Young teenage cannabis users who lose some of their capacity to learn complex functions and who flee from reality to a world of dreams. With its sedative effect, cannabis could modify such emotions as anger and anxiety and slow down the liberation process of adolescence. b) Heavy daily users, often persons who cannot cope with depression or their life circumstances. c) Psychiatric patients whose resistance to relapses into psychotic reactions might be diminished according to the psychotropic effects of cannabis.",

Conventional MPS, caused by inborn deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes involved in GAG degradation, display various multisystemic symptoms-including progressive neurological complications, ophthalmological disorders, hearing loss, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary issues, cardiorespiratory problems, bone and joint abnormalities, dwarfism, and coarse facial features. Mucopolysaccharidosis-Plus Syndrome (MPSPS), an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the endo-lysosomal tethering protein VPS33A, shows additional renal and hematopoietic abnormalities (\"Plus symptoms\") uncommon in conventional MPS. Here, we analyze data from biochemical, histological, and physical examinations-particularly of blood counts and kidney function-to further characterize the clinical phenotype of MPSPS. A series of blood tests indicate hematopoietic symptoms including progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia, which correlate with histological observations of hypoplastic bone marrow. High urinary excretion of protein (caused by impairments in renal filtration), hypoalbuminemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, cholesterol, and uric acid indicate renal dysfunction. Histological analyses of MPSPS kidneys similarly suggest the extensive destruction of glomerular structures by foamy podocytes.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate for differences in metabolomic profiles between fatigued and non-fatigued patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) during chemotherapy (CTX). METHOD: Patients were recruited from the department of surgery in a large medical center in Taiwan. In this longitudinal pilot study, the Fatigue Symptom Inventory and fasting blood samples were collected at three assessments (i.e., prior to surgery (T0), three months (T1) and six months (T2) after surgery). Metabolomic profile analysis was used. Multilevel regression and pathway analyses were performed to identify differences in metabolomic profiles between the fatigued and non-fatigued groups. RESULTS: Of the 49 patients, 55.1% (n\u00a0=\u00a027) were in the fatigue group. All of the 15 metabolites that had statistically significant group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interactions in the differential metabolite analysis were entered into the pathway analysis. Two pathways were enriched for these metabolites, namely galactose metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this pilot study suggest that pathways involved in galactose metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis are associated with cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with CRC during CTX. These findings are consistent with the hypotheses that alterations in energy metabolism and increases in inflammation are associated with the development and maintenance of CRF.",

In many neurological diseases treatment targeting pathogenic genes have significatively improved the natural profile of the disease: this is perfectly illustrated for familial amyloid neuropathy and spinal muscular atrophy. Because of these findings and the urgent need to find a cure for ALS, many trials have focused on familial ALS targeting the four most important genes linked to the disease: C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS. We propose in this review an update on the perspectives of treatment that may be available in mid-term in hALS and will discuss in the last part the potential consequences for asymptomatic relatives of patients with a hALS and for ALS patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare, life-threatening, genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. Treatment in RTT encounters many challenges. Trofinetide, a modified amino-terminal tripeptide of insulin-like growth factor 1, has demonstrated clinically promising results in RTT. In this study, trofinetide efficacy and safety in RTT are systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed. METHODS: A systematic search of five electronic databases was conducted until January 2024. Review Manager 5.4 software was used for the analysis. The analysis was based on a weighted mean difference and standard error with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, and a statistically significant P-value was considered if it was\u2009<\u20090.05. The study was registered on PROSPERO with registration number CRD42024499849. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS: Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 276 patients were included in the analysis. Trofinetide improved both caregiver outcomes and clinical scales by improving the Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ) (mean difference (MD):\u2009-\u20093.46 points, 95% CI:\u2009-\u20095.63 to\u2009-\u20091.27, P\u2009=\u20090.0002) and Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I) (MD:\u2009-\u20090.35, 95% CI:\u2009-\u20090.51 to\u2009-\u20090.18, P\u2009<\u20090.0001), respectively. However, trofinetide neither improved the Caregiver Top 3 Concerns Visual Analog Scale nor the Rett Motor Behavioral Assessment. Regarding safety, trofinetide was significantly associated with vomiting compared to placebo (odds ratio (OR): 3.17, 95% CI: 1.57 to 6.43, P\u2009=\u20090.001). After solving heterogeneity, results showed a statistically significant incidence of diarrhea in the trofinetide (200\u00a0mg) group compared to placebo (OR: 18.51, 95% CI: 9.30 to 36.84, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Trofinetide demonstrated statistically significant improvements in CGI-I and RSBQ in pediatrics and adult patients with Rett. Side effects are limited to vomiting and diarrhea. Although diarrhea yielded an insignificant result in our analysis, it emerged as a cause for treatment discontinuation in the participating trials, and a statistically significant risk for diarrhea emerged when excluding the study using a lower dose of the drug, hence causing heterogeneity, in the\u00a0meta-analysis. Given the diverse genetic landscape of RTT, future RCTs investigating correlations between RTT genotype and phenotypic improvements by trofinetide will be beneficial. RCTs encompassing male patients with larger and longer cohorts are recommended.",

        "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, still represents one of the most common causes of persisting disability with an early disease onset. Growing evidence suggests B cells to play a crucial role in its pathogenesis and progression. Over the last decades, monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against the surface protein CD20 have been intensively studied as a B cell targeting therapy in relapsing MS (RMS) as well as primary progressive MS (PPMS). Pivotal studies on anti-CD20 therapy in RMS showed remarkable clinical and radiological effects, especially on acute inflammation and relapse biology. These results paved the way for further research on the implication of B cells in the pathogenesis of MS. Besides controlling relapse development in RMS, ocrelizumab (OCR) also showed clinical benefits in patients with PPMS and became the first approved drug for this disease course. In this review, we provide an overview of the current anti-CD20 mabs used or tested for the treatment of MS-namely rituximab (RTX), OCR, ofatumumab (OFA), and ublituximab (UB). Besides their effectiveness, we also discuss possible limitations and safety concerns especially in regard to long-term treatment, both for this class of drugs overall as well as for each anti-CD20 mab individually. Additionally, we elucidate to what extent anti-CD20 therapy may alter the function of other immune cells, both directly or indirectly.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a major complaint of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. However, little is known about its pathophysiological mechanisms. Evidence from chronic fatigue syndrome and studies on sickness behaviour suggest that immune and neuroendocrine factors may play a causative role in the development of fatigue. METHODS: We compared whole blood stimulatory capacity for pro- (TNFalpha, IFNgamma) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) as well as hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function in 15 MS patients with marked fatigue and 15 patients without fatigue as determined by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). RESULTS: Proinflammatory cytokines were significantly higher (TNFalpha: 478.9 v 228.2 pg/ml, p = 0.01; IFNgamma: 57.6 v 27.8 pg/ml; p = 0.01) in MS patients with fatigue. Furthermore, TNFalpha values significantly correlated with daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (r = 0.64, p = 0.001). Controlling for disease activity (as measured by the Cambridge Multiple Sclerosis Basic Score), disease duration, Expanded Disability Status Scale, and depression further increased the correlation of cytokine production and fatigue. HPA axis activity was not related to fatigue but was modestly correlated with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that fatigue in MS is at least partially mediated through activation of proinflammatory cytokines. In line with earlier findings, HPA axis dysfunction seems not to be relevant in MS fatigue pathogenesis but appears to be linked to cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest that increased levels of inflammatory cytokines may be involved in MS fatigue. Investigation of cytokine profiles may increase the understanding of fatigue pathogenesis in MS.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effect of neonatal treatment with kaempferol on neuromotor development, proliferation of neural precursor cells, the microglia profile, and antioxidant enzyme gene expression in the hippocampus. METHODS: A rat model of cerebral palsy was established using perinatal anoxia and sensorimotor restriction of hindlimbs during infancy. Kaempferol (1\u2005mg/ kg) was intraperitoneally administered during the neonatal period. RESULTS: Neonatal treatment with kaempferol reduces the impact of the cerebral palsy model on reflex ontogeny and on the maturation of physical features. Impairment of locomotor activity development and motor coordination was found to be attenuated by kaempferol treatment during the neonatal period in rats exposed to cerebral palsy. Neonatal treatment of kaempferol in cerebral palsy rats prevents a substantial reduction in the number of neural precursor cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, an activated microglia profile, and increased proliferation of microglia in the sub-granular zone and in the granular cell layer. Neonatal treatment with kaempferol increases gene expression of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the hippocampus of rats submitted to the cerebral palsy model. DISCUSSION: Kaempferol attenuates the impact of cerebral palsy on neuromotor behavior development, preventing altered hippocampal microglia activation and mitigating impaired cell proliferation in a neurogenic niche in these rats. Neonatal treatment with kaempferol also increases antioxidant defense gene expression in the hippocampus of rats submitted to the cerebral palsy model.",

To prevent adverse psychosocial outcomes in young carers (YCs), primary prevention resilience building interventions have been recommended. We describe the study protocol of an international randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an innovative group intervention designed to promote the mental health and well-being of adolescent YCs (AYCs) aged 15-17. The RCT will be conducted in six European countries in the context of the Horizon 2020 European funded research and innovation project \"Psychosocial support for promoting mental health and well-being among adolescent young caregivers in Europe\" (\"ME-WE\"). The ME-WE intervention is based on Hayes and Ciarrochi's psychoeducational model for adolescents and will consist of seven 2-h sessions in a group format, aimed to help AYCs build psychological flexibility and live according to their values. The control group will be a waitlist. Primary and secondary outcomes and control variables will be measured at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and 3 months follow-up (T2). The COVID-19 pandemic has made amendments necessary to the original study protocol methodology, which we describe in detail. This study will contribute to building an evidence-based manualized program that educators and health and social care professionals can use to support AYCs in their transition to adulthood. From a research perspective, the outcomes of this study will contribute to evidence-based practices in primary prevention of psychosocial difficulties in AYCs and will gather novel knowledge on the effectiveness of Hayes and Ciarrochi's model for use with middle adolescents with caring responsibilities.

        "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are rare lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) characterized by the excessive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Conventional MPS, caused by inborn deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes involved in GAG degradation, display various multisystemic symptoms-including progressive neurological complications, ophthalmological disorders, hearing loss, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary issues, cardiorespiratory problems, bone and joint abnormalities, dwarfism, and coarse facial features. Mucopolysaccharidosis-Plus Syndrome (MPSPS), an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the endo-lysosomal tethering protein VPS33A, shows additional renal and hematopoietic abnormalities (\"Plus symptoms\") uncommon in conventional MPS. Here, we analyze data from biochemical, histological, and physical examinations-particularly of blood counts and kidney function-to further characterize the clinical phenotype of MPSPS. A series of blood tests indicate hematopoietic symptoms including progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia, which correlate with histological observations of hypoplastic bone marrow. High urinary excretion of protein (caused by impairments in renal filtration), hypoalbuminemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, cholesterol, and uric acid indicate renal dysfunction. Histological analyses of MPSPS kidneys similarly suggest the extensive destruction of glomerular structures by foamy podocytes. Height and weight did not significantly deviate from the average, but in some cases, growth began to decline at around six months or one year of age.",

        "abstract": "The present study examined genetic, prenatal, and postnatal environmental pathways in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and depressive symptoms from parents to early adolescents (when these symptoms start to increase), while considering timing effects of exposure to parent anxiety and depressive symptoms postnatally. The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

        "title": "Is trofinetide a future treatment for Rett syndrome? A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare, life-threatening, genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. Treatment in RTT encounters many challenges. Trofinetide, a modified amino-terminal tripeptide of insulin-like growth factor 1, has demonstrated clinically promising results in RTT. In this study, trofinetide efficacy and safety in RTT are systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed. METHODS: A systematic search of five electronic databases was conducted until January 2024. Review Manager 5.4 software was used for the analysis. The analysis was based on a weighted mean difference and standard error with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, and a statistically significant P-value was considered if it was\u2009<\u20090.05. The study was registered on PROSPERO with registration number CRD42024499849. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS: Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 276 patients were included in the analysis. Trofinetide improved both caregiver outcomes and clinical scales by improving the Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ) (mean difference (MD):\u2009-\u20093.46 points, 95% CI:\u2009-\u20095.63 to\u2009-\u20091.27, P\u2009=\u20090.0002) and Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I) (MD:\u2009-\u20090.35, 95% CI:\u2009-\u20090.51 to\u2009-\u20090.18, P\u2009<\u20090.0001), respectively. However, trofinetide neither improved the Caregiver Top 3 Concerns Visual Analog Scale nor the Rett Motor Behavioral Assessment. Regarding safety, trofinetide was significantly associated with vomiting compared to placebo (odds ratio (OR): 3.17, 95% CI: 1.57 to 6.43, P\u2009=\u20090.001). After solving heterogeneity, results showed a statistically significant incidence of diarrhea in the trofinetide (200\u00a0mg) group compared to placebo (OR: 18.51, 95% CI: 9.30 to 36.84, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Trofinetide demonstrated statistically significant improvements in CGI-I and RSBQ in pediatrics and adult patients with Rett. Side effects are limited to vomiting and diarrhea. Although diarrhea yielded an insignificant result in our analysis, it emerged as a cause for treatment discontinuation in the participating trials, and a statistically significant risk for diarrhea emerged when excluding the study using a lower dose of the drug, hence causing heterogeneity, in the\u00a0meta-analysis. Given the diverse genetic landscape of RTT, future RCTs investigating correlations between RTT genotype and phenotypic improvements by trofinetide will be beneficial. RCTs encompassing male patients with larger and longer cohorts are recommended.",

        "title": "Male contraception: narrative review of ongoing research.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the release of the combined oral contraceptive pill in 1960, women have shouldered the burden of contraception and family planning. Over 60 years later, this is still the case as the only practical, effective contraceptive options available to men are condoms and vasectomy. However, there are now a variety of promising hormonal and non-hormonal male contraceptive options being studied. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide clinicians and laypeople with focused, up-to-date descriptions of novel strategies and targets for male contraception. We include a cautiously optimistic discussion of benefits and potential drawbacks, highlighting several methods in preclinical and clinical stages of development. RESULTS: As of June 2023, two hormonal male contraceptive methods are undergoing phase II clinical trials for safety and efficacy. A large-scale, international phase IIb trial investigating efficacy of transdermal segesterone acetate (Nestorone) plus testosterone gel has enrolled over 460 couples with completion estimated for late 2024. A second hormonal method, dimethandrolone undecanoate, is in two clinical trials focusing on safety, pharmacodynamics, suppression of spermatogenesis and hormones; the first of these two is estimated for completion in December 2024. There are also several non-hormonal methods with strong potential in preclinical stages of development. CONCLUSIONS: There exist several hurdles to novel male contraception. Therapeutic development takes decades of time, meticulous work, and financial investment, but with so many strong candidates it is our hope that there will soon be several safe, effective, and reversible contraceptive options available to male patients. R\u00e9SUM\u00e9: CONTEXTE: Depuis la sortie de la pilule contraceptive orale combin\u00e9e en 1960, les femmes ont assum\u00e9 le fardeau de la contraception et de la planification familiale. Plus de 60 ans plus tard, c\u2019est toujours le cas, car les seules options contraceptives pratiques et efficaces disponibles pour les hommes sont les pr\u00e9servatifs et la vasectomie. Cependant, il existe maintenant une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019options contraceptives masculines hormonales et non hormonales prometteuses qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude. Le but de cette revue narrative est de fournir aux cliniciens et aux profanes des descriptions cibl\u00e9es et \u00e0 jour de nouvelles strat\u00e9gies et cibles pour la contraception masculine. Nous incluons une discussion prudemment optimiste sur les avantages et les inconv\u00e9nients potentiels, en soulignant plusieurs m\u00e9thodes aux stades pr\u00e9cliniques et cliniques du d\u00e9veloppement. R\u00e9SULTATS: En juin 2023, deux m\u00e9thodes contraceptives masculines hormonales faisaient l\u2019objet d\u2019essais cliniques de phase II pour leur innocuit\u00e9 et leur efficacit\u00e9.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among pediatric patients throughout the world. The varying microbiological pattern of sepsis warrants the need for researches on the causative organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. The epidemiology of neonatal and pediatric sepsis in Ethiopia is under-research. The objective of this study was to evaluate the burden of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among children suspected of sepsis. METHODS: An institutional-based prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 370 pediatric(age birth-15 years) patients suspected of sepsis at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized hospital from December 2020 to November 2021. Blood samples were collected aseptically and inoculated into Tryptone Soya Broth for culture. The organisms grown were identified by standard microbiological methods and subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing by modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method recommended by Clinical laboratory and standard institute. Methicillin resistance was confirmed using Cefoxitin disk diffusion method. Data entry and analysis were done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 software. A p-value less than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval was considered statically significant. RESULTS: Out of the total 370 study subjects, 21.6% (80/370) of them were culture positive. Of these, 43 (53.8%) and 37 (46.3%) were Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, respectively. The most prevalent Gram-positive bacterial isolate was Staphylococcus aureus (n\u2009=\u200924; 30%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (n\u2009=\u20097; 8.8%). Among the Gram-negative bacterial isolates, the leading bacteria was Klebsiella pneumoniae (n\u2009=\u200920; 25%) followed by Escherichia coli (n\u2009=\u20097; 8.8%). Clindamycin, Chloramphenicol, Gentamicin and Ciprofloxacin were the most effective antibiotics against Gram-positive bacterial isolates while Amikacin, Meropenem and Chloramphenicol were effective against Gram-negative pathogens. Methicillin resistance was detected in 45.8% of Staphylococcus aureus. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was observed in 76% of the bacterial isolates. CONCLUSION: Gram positive bacteria were the predominant isolates among pediatric sepsis cases and most of the bacterial isolates showed MDR. Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were frequently isolated bacteria. The high prevalence of drug resistance warrants rational use of antibiotics and the need for regular antibiotic susceptibility surveillance studies.",

Trofinetide is a synthetic analog of glycine-proline-glutamate, the N-terminal tripeptide of the insulin-like growth factor 1 protein, and has demonstrated clinical benefit in phase 2 studies in Rett syndrome. In this phase 3 study ( https://clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04181723 ), females with Rett syndrome received twice-daily oral trofinetide (n\u2009=\u200993) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200994) for 12 weeks. For the coprimary efficacy endpoints, least squares mean (LSM) change from baseline to week 12 in the Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire for trofinetide versus placebo was -4.9 versus -1.7 (P\u2009=\u20090.0175; Cohen's d effect size, 0.37), and LSM Clinical Global Impression-Improvement at week 12 was 3.5 versus 3.8 (P\u2009=\u20090.0030; effect size, 0.47). For the key secondary efficacy endpoint, LSM change from baseline to week 12 in the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile Infant-Toddler Checklist Social Composite score was -0.1 versus -1.1 (P\u2009=\u20090.0064; effect size, 0.43). Common treatment-emergent adverse events included diarrhea (80.6% for trofinetide versus 19.1% for placebo), which was mostly mild to moderate in severity.

        "title": "The pyrethroids metabolite 3-phenoxybenzoic acid induces dopaminergic degeneration.",
        "abstract": "Exposure to pyrethroids, a significant class of the most widely used agricultural chemicals, has been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, although many different pyrethroids induce roughly the same symptoms of Parkinsonism, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To find the shared key features among these mechanisms, we focused on 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common and prominent metabolite of most pyrethroids produced via hydrolysis by CEs in mammals. To determine the contribution of 3-PBA to the initiation and progression of PD, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively, and found that 3-PBA not only accumulates in murine brain tissues over time but also further induces PD-like pathologies (increased \u03b1-syn and phospho-S129, decreased TH) to the same or even greater extent than the precursor pyrethroid. A before-after study of PET-DAT in the same mice revealed that low concentrations of 3-PBA (0.5 mg/kg) could paradoxically cause DAT to increase (22.46% higher than pre-drug test). The intervention of DAT inhibitors and activators respectively alleviated and enhanced the dopaminergic toxicity of 3-PBA, indicating that 3-PBA interacts with DAT. In particular, low concentrations of 3-PBA increase the DAT, which in turn induces 3-PBA to enter the dopaminergic neurons to exert toxic effects. Finally, we described a mechanism underlying this potential role of 3-PBA in the pathological aggregation of \u03b1-syn. Specifically, 3-PBA was found to dysregulate C/EBP \u03b2 levels and further anomalously activate AEP in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by increased accumulation of pathologically cleaved \u03b1-syn (N103 fragments) and accelerated \u03b1-syn aggregation. All these results suggest that 3-PBA exposure could mimic the pathological and pathogenetic features of PD, showing that this metabolite is a key pathogenic compound in pyrethroid-related pathological effects and a possible dopamine neurotoxin. Additionally, our findings provide a crucial reference for the primary prevention of PD.",

Although progress in the therapeutic field remains unsatisfactory, we have to notice that genetics have undergone impressive improvements over the last three decades and, by extension, our knowledge of ALS cases linked to a pathogenic mutation that accounts for 10% of all cases (either sporadic or familiar) and is currently called hereditary ALS (hALS). In many neurological diseases treatment targeting pathogenic genes have significatively improved the natural profile of the disease: this is perfectly illustrated for familial amyloid neuropathy and spinal muscular atrophy. Because of these findings and the urgent need to find a cure for ALS, many trials have focused on familial ALS targeting the four most important genes linked to the disease: C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS. We propose in this review an update on the perspectives of treatment that may be available in mid-term in hALS and will discuss in the last part the potential consequences for asymptomatic relatives of patients with a hALS and for ALS patients.",

To prevent adverse psychosocial outcomes in young carers (YCs), primary prevention resilience building interventions have been recommended. We describe the study protocol of an international randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an innovative group intervention designed to promote the mental health and well-being of adolescent YCs (AYCs) aged 15-17. The RCT will be conducted in six European countries in the context of the Horizon 2020 European funded research and innovation project \"Psychosocial support for promoting mental health and well-being among adolescent young caregivers in Europe\" (\"ME-WE\"). The ME-WE intervention is based on Hayes and Ciarrochi's psychoeducational model for adolescents and will consist of seven 2-h sessions in a group format, aimed to help AYCs build psychological flexibility and live according to their values. The control group will be a waitlist. Primary and secondary outcomes and control variables will be measured at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and 3 months follow-up (T2). The COVID-19 pandemic has made amendments necessary to the original study protocol methodology, which we describe in detail. This study will contribute to building an evidence-based manualized program that educators and health and social care professionals can use to support AYCs in their transition to adulthood. From a research perspective, the outcomes of this study will contribute to evidence-based practices in primary prevention of psychosocial difficulties in AYCs and will gather novel knowledge on the effectiveness of Hayes and Ciarrochi's model for use with middle adolescents with caring responsibilities.

Recent research, however, suggests a role of vitamin K in bone metabolism. The metabolic role of vitamin K is to facilitate the carboxylation of glutamyl to gamma-carboxyglutamyl residues. Besides the hepatic tissue, in which the clotting factors are produced gamma-carboxyglutamyl-containing proteins are also abundantly available in bone tissue. Osteocalcin accounts for up to 80% of the total gamma-carboxyglutamyl content of mature bone. Human carboxylated osteocalcin contains 3 gamma-carboxyglutamyl residues which confer a highly specific affinity to the calcium ion of the hydroxyapatite molecule. Besides the gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin vitamin K may also affect other parameters of bone metabolism, such as calcium hemostasis, and prostaglandin E2 and interleukin 6 production. Evidence from observational studies and first intervention trials indicate that vitamin K intakes much higher than the current recommendations improved biochemical markers of bone formation as well as bone density. In conclusion, the mechanistic data as well as the observational data and the results of the first controlled clinical trials in humans point to a beneficial effect of additional intakes of vitamin K in bone health.",

        "abstract": "Vitamin K is required for the posttranslational modification of liver precursors of prothrombin, blood coagulation Factors VII, IX, and X and additional proteins of undetermined functions in plasma and other tissues. This modification involves the formation of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, an acidic amino acid needed for the interaction of these proteins with calcium ions. The vitamin is a cofactor of a unique microsomal carboxylase which requires the reduced form of vitamin K, CO2, and molecular oxygen. The vitamin is apparently oxidized to its 2,3-epoxide during the carboxylation reaction. Liver microsomes also contain an enzyme which catalyzes the reduction of the epoxide to the vitamin, vitamin K epoxide reductase, and a number of vitamin K reductases. The epoxide reductase appears to be the site of the anticoagulant action of 4-hydroxycoumarins, commonly used as oral anticoagulants.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aging is a complex and gradual biological process that represents the major risk factor with respect to the development of chronic degenerative diseases, often associated with disability. Diet and nu-trition, coupled with proper physical activity have a significant impact on the health status of the elderly with a decreased risk of disease being indicative of successful aging. Musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia are the most frequently reported disorders among the elderly community. METHODS: This study presents a systematic review of the literature on the potential benefits of several nutra-ceuticals in promoting healthy aging and in reducing the risk of chronic diseases in elderly individuals. RESULTS: Dietary components including vitamins (vitamin C, B vitamin and vitamin K) flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, anthocyanins, and isoflavones), minerals (e.g., magnesium, zinc and potassium) and other nutrients such phytoestrogens, amino acids, and omega-3 fatty acids help in slowing the aging process, which ultimately results in increased lifespan and longevity. CONCLUSIONS: This paper highlights the key nutrients and phytochemicals of nutraceutical importance for the healthy aging of the elderly population. Although the scientific literature provides evidences of therapeutic effectiveness of nutraceuticals, more in-depth clinical investigations are needed.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cannabis use has been the most commonly used illicit psychoactive substance in India. Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the 5-year survival rate of childhood cancer patients can be more than 80%, but some patients with relapse and refractory cancers have shown no good response to traditional strategies. Chimeric antigen receptor engineered T (CAR-T) cell therapy is promising for these patients. CAR-T cells recognize the tumor-associated antigens in a non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted manner, so their anti-tumor ability is enhanced. There are four generations of CAR-T cells now. The complete remission rate of pediatric patients with relapse and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia can be as high as 90% when treated with CD19-targeting CAR-T cells. Furthermore, CAR-T cell therapy can also be used to bridge to transplantation and donor CAR-T cell infusion can be a strategy to prevent relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. As to solid tumors, only patients with neuroblastoma present good response to the GD2-targeting CAR-T cell therapy. The toxic or side effects of CAR-T cell therapy include cytokine release syndrome, off-tumor effect, tumor lysis syndrome, and insertion mutation. Although the CD19-targeting CAR-T cell therapy for childhood cancer can result in a high remission rate, the relapse rate is high, including CD19 \u513f\u7ae5\u80bf\u7624\u60a3\u8005\u76845\u5e74\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u5df2\u8fbe80%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u590d\u53d1\u96be\u6cbb\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u7edf\u6cbb\u7597\u624b\u6bb5\u96be\u4ee5\u53d6\u5f97\u7406\u60f3\u7597\u6548\u3002\u5d4c\u5408\u6297\u539f\u53d7\u4f53\uff08CAR\uff09-T\u7ec6\u80de\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u6cbb\u6108\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80bf\u7624\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5e0c\u671b\u3002CAR-T\u7ec6\u80de\u901a\u8fc7\u975eMHC\u9650\u5236\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u80bf\u7624\u76f8\u5173\u6297\u539f\uff0c\u6297\u80bf\u7624\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5df2\u53d1\u5c55\u5230\u7b2c\u56db\u4ee3\u3002\u9776\u5411CD19\u7684CAR-T\u7ec6\u80de\u6cbb\u7597\u590d\u53d1\u96be\u6cbb\u6027\u6025\u6027\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ec6\u80de\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u7f13\u89e3\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6865\u63a5\u9020\u8840\u5e72\u7ec6\u80de\u79fb\u690d\u3001\u4f9b\u8005CAR-T\u7ec6\u80de\u8f93\u6ce8\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u8f85\u52a9\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u3002\u5b9e\u4f53\u7624\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u9776\u5411GD2\u7684CAR-T\u7ec6\u80de\u6cbb\u7597\u795e\u7ecf\u6bcd\u7ec6\u80de\u7624\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u5b9e\u4f53\u7624\u6548\u679c\u6b20\u4f73\u3002CAR-T\u7ec6\u80de\u6cbb\u7597\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7ec6\u80de\u56e0\u5b50\u91ca\u653e\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u3001\u8131\u9776\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u80bf\u7624\u6eb6\u89e3\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u3001\u63d2\u5165\u7a81\u53d8\u7b49\u6bd2\u526f\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u9776\u5411CD19\u7684CAR-T\u7ec6\u80de\u6cbb\u7597\u867d\u6709\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u590d\u53d1\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u5305\u62ecCD19",

It was hypothesized that the experience of emotional abuse would predict depressive symptoms via development of rumination and negative inferences. A 3-wave longitudinal study was carried out with 998 adolescents (471 girls and 526 boys) between 13 and 17\u00a0years of age. Results showed that emotional abuse by parents and peers at Time 1 predicted a worsening of several cognitive vulnerabilities at Time 2. In addition, brooding mediated between the experiences of abuse and the increase of depressive symptoms at Time 3. Thus, findings suggest that the experiences of childhood emotional abuse by parents and peers serve as antecedents to develop a negative cognitive style, vulnerability that, once developed, is a risk factor for the onset of depressive symptoms in adolescence.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess men's preferences for healthcare provider from whom they would obtain hormonal male contraceptive (HMC) methods. STUDY DESIGN: We asked participants from 3 clinical trials of investigational HMC methods-an oral pill (11\u03b2-Methyl-19-nortestosterone-17\u03b2-dodecylcarbonate, 11\u03b2-MNTDC), intramuscular or subcutaneous injection (Dimethandrolone undecanoate), and transdermal gel (Nestorone and testosterone)-to rank their top 3 preferred HMC providers from a list including: men's health doctor (urologist/andrologist), hormonal doctor (endocrinologist), reproductive health doctor (OB/GYN), family planning clinician (community health worker, midwife, nurse practitioner), regular doctor (family medicine/internal medicine), and community pharmacist. We examined preferences based on their rankings and conducted bivariate analyses. Collapsing the various specialists (men's health doctor, hormonal doctor, reproductive health doctor, and family planning clinician) into a single provider type, we examined participant demographics against provider preference (regular doctor, pharmacist, or specialist). RESULTS: Participants across the 3 trials (n\u00a0=\u00a0124) ranked their regular doctor (44%) and community pharmacist (18%) as their most preferred HMC provider; these preferences did not differ significantly by trial and drug formulation. Specialists in family planning (13%), men's health (12%), reproductive health (10%), and hormones (4%) were least frequently ranked as their preferred provider. Older and higher educated participants more often preferred specialists over regular doctors and pharmacists (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). CONCLUSIONS: Despite receiving contraceptive steroid hormones and care from endocrinologists and family planning specialists in a clinical trial, participants would prefer to obtain contraception from their regular doctor. IMPLICATIONS: As most men expect to obtain hormonal male contraceptives from their regular doctor when commercially available, primary care physicians should become familiar with HMCs and be prepared to provide counseling and options accordingly.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite a high mortality rate in childhood, there is limited evidence on the causes and outcomes of paediatric bloodstream infections from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize the bacterial causes of paediatric bloodstream infections in LMICs and their resistance profile. METHODS: We searched Pubmed and Embase databases between January 1st 1990 and October 30th 2019, combining MeSH and free-text terms for \"sepsis\" and \"low-middle-income countries\" in children. Two reviewers screened articles and performed data extraction to identify studies investigating children (1\u2009month-18\u2009years), with at least one blood culture. The main outcomes of interests were the rate of positive blood cultures, the distribution of bacterial pathogens, the resistance patterns and the case-fatality rate. The proportions obtained from each study were pooled using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation, and a random-effect meta-analysis model was used. RESULTS: We identified 2403 eligible studies, 17 were included in the final review including 52,915 children (11 in Africa and 6 in Asia). The overall percentage of positive blood culture was 19.1% [95% CI: 12.0-27.5%]; 15.5% [8.4-24.4%] in Africa and 28.0% [13.2-45.8%] in Asia. A total of 4836 bacterial isolates were included in the studies; 2974 were Gram-negative (63.9% [52.2-74.9]) and 1858 were Gram-positive (35.8% [24.9-47.5]). In Asia,  CONCLUSIONS: We observed a marked variation in pathogen distribution and their resistance profiles between Asia and Africa. Very limited data is available on underlying risk factors for bacteraemia, patterns of treatment of multidrug-resistant infections and predictors of adverse outcomes.",

        "title": "Lecanemab in Early Alzheimer's Disease.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The accumulation of soluble and insoluble aggregated amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) may initiate or potentiate pathologic processes in Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to A\u03b2 soluble protofibrils, is being tested in persons with early Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We conducted an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial involving persons 50 to 90 years of age with early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) with evidence of amyloid on positron-emission tomography (PET) or by cerebrospinal fluid testing. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous lecanemab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline at 18 months in the score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). Key secondary end points were the change in amyloid burden on PET, the score on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90; higher scores indicate greater impairment), the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS; range, 0 to 1.97; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL; range, 0 to 53; lower scores indicate greater impairment). RESULTS: A total of 1795 participants were enrolled, with 898 assigned to receive lecanemab and 897 to receive placebo. The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, -0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.23; P<0.001). In a substudy involving 698 participants, there were greater reductions in brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo (difference, -59.1 centiloids; 95% CI, -62.6 to -55.6). Other mean differences between the two groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14 score, -1.44 (95% CI, -2.27 to -0.61; P<0.001); for the ADCOMS, -0.050 (95% CI, -0.074 to -0.027; P<0.001); and for the ADCS-MCI-ADL score, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001). Lecanemab resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions in 12.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Lecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events. Longer trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease. (Funded by Eisai and Biogen; Clarity AD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03887455.).",

        "abstract": "Despite the fact that about 150 millions women must have taken hormonal contraceptives all over the world since the 1960s, the risk/benefit ratio of this birth control method has yet not been reliably assessed. The side effects of the pill on the skin do not pertain, in general, to those (like thrombo-embolism or, perhaps, breast cancer) which might be life-threatening, but they are probably more frequent and may have a potential to alter the quality of life of women who use it. The aim of this paper is to review the dermatological effects of hormonal contraceptives from the point of view of everyday prescribing, with the emphasis on the quality of life of patients. The reported side effects of the pill are therefore classified according to their real or probable frequency, not to their severity or the theoretical importance of their mechanisms. As it would be unwise to speak of the risks without consideration for the benefits, an attempt is made to compare the dermatological safety profile of oral contraceptives to that of other birth control methods (barrier contraceptive methods, intrauterine devices, etc.) on the one hand; on the other hand, one insists upon the fact that the pill in itself may have health benefits, general (reduction in the incidence of some cancers) or dermatological (e. g. an effect on acne).",

        "abstract": "Fatigue is defined as a symptom leading to the inability to continue functioning at the expected activity level. It is a highly prevalent symptom, challenging to frame into monodimensional pathophysiological mechanisms. As a result, fatigue is often underestimated in the clinical setting and is wrongly considered an unavoidable consequence of ageing. Several potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue have been proposed, including sleep patterns, autonomic nervous system abnormalities and biological complexity. Inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the most promising mechanisms through which malnutrition may cause fatigue. Not surprisingly, fatigue is highly prevalent in inflammatory conditions (e.g. COVID-19 infection). The nutritional status may also represent a critical factor in the development and presentation of fatigue, which may mimic the exhaustion of the individual's metabolic reserves. For example, the insufficient dietary intake of energy and proteins may determine the catabolism of body fat and muscles, disrupt the homeostatic balance and cause the onset of fatigue. It is necessary to conduct research on fatigue. By characterising its pathophysiological mechanisms, it will be possible to (1) support the design and development of targeted interventions, (2) improve the quality of life of many persons by acting on the symptom and (3) reduce the direct and indirect costs of a burdening condition typical of advancing age. In the present review, we provide an overview of the role that nutrition may play as a determinant of fatigue in older people, also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial metabolic syndrome associated with a pathophysiology intertwined with increased inflammatory response, anorexia, metabolic dysregulation, insulin resistance, and hormonal alterations, which together generate a negative energy balance in favor of catabolism. The development of therapeutic strategies to treat cancer cachexia has always been related to clinical interventions with increased food intake/supplementation, physical exercise regimens, and/or medication to attenuate catabolism and increase the anabolic response. However, the approval of drugs by regulatory agencies has always been a challenge. AREAS COVERED: This review outlines the main pharmacotherapy findings in cancer cachexia as well as the ongoing clinical trials that have evaluated changes in body composition and muscle function. The National Library of Medicine (PubMed) was used as search tool. EXPERT OPINION: The pharmacological therapy for cachexia should be focused on improving body composition, muscle function, and mortality, although none of the compounds used so far was able to demonstrate positive results beyond increased appetite and improvements in body composition. Ponsegromab (GDF15 inhibitor), a new compound that has just entered a phase II clinical trial, is a promising candidate to treat cancer cachexia and may produce exciting results if the study can be conducted as planned.",

        "abstract": "Progressive pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating condition and current treatment is suboptimal. There has been considerable interest in the role of tyrosine kinase signaling as mediators of pro- and antifibrotic processes. Nintedanib is a nonspecific tyrosine kinase that has been shown to have therapeutic benefit in lung fibrosis. However, the precise mechanism of action remains unclear because nintedanib inhibits several tyrosine kinases, which are often expressed on multiple cell types with different activities during fibrosis. Discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) has been suggested as a potential target of nintedanib. DDR2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by fibrillar collagens such as type I collagen. DDR2 is primarily expressed by fibroblasts. The effectiveness of specifically targeting DDR2 signaling during fibrosis remains undefined. In the present study, we show that nintedanib acts as a direct and indirect inhibitor of DDR2. We then utilize a novel allosteric inhibitor of DDR2, WRG-28, which blocks ligand binding and activation of DDR2. We find that WRG-28 augments fibroblast apoptosis and attenuates fibrosis. Finally, we show that fibroblast type I collagen autocrine signaling is regulated by DDR2 through both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions of DDR2. These findings highlight the importance of type I collagen autocrine signaling by fibroblasts during fibrosis and demonstrate that DDR2 has a central role in this pathway making it a potential therapeutic target.",

        "title": "The pyrethroids metabolite 3-phenoxybenzoic acid induces dopaminergic degeneration.",
        "abstract": "Exposure to pyrethroids, a significant class of the most widely used agricultural chemicals, has been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, although many different pyrethroids induce roughly the same symptoms of Parkinsonism, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To find the shared key features among these mechanisms, we focused on 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common and prominent metabolite of most pyrethroids produced via hydrolysis by CEs in mammals. To determine the contribution of 3-PBA to the initiation and progression of PD, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively, and found that 3-PBA not only accumulates in murine brain tissues over time but also further induces PD-like pathologies (increased \u03b1-syn and phospho-S129, decreased TH) to the same or even greater extent than the precursor pyrethroid. A before-after study of PET-DAT in the same mice revealed that low concentrations of 3-PBA (0.5 mg/kg) could paradoxically cause DAT to increase (22.46% higher than pre-drug test). The intervention of DAT inhibitors and activators respectively alleviated and enhanced the dopaminergic toxicity of 3-PBA, indicating that 3-PBA interacts with DAT. In particular, low concentrations of 3-PBA increase the DAT, which in turn induces 3-PBA to enter the dopaminergic neurons to exert toxic effects. Finally, we described a mechanism underlying this potential role of 3-PBA in the pathological aggregation of \u03b1-syn. Specifically, 3-PBA was found to dysregulate C/EBP \u03b2 levels and further anomalously activate AEP in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by increased accumulation of pathologically cleaved \u03b1-syn (N103 fragments) and accelerated \u03b1-syn aggregation. All these results suggest that 3-PBA exposure could mimic the pathological and pathogenetic features of PD, showing that this metabolite is a key pathogenic compound in pyrethroid-related pathological effects and a possible dopamine neurotoxin. Additionally, our findings provide a crucial reference for the primary prevention of PD.",

This study investigated the relationship between intimate partner violence, severe acute maternal morbidity in the intensive care unit (ICU), and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study in a hospital in Lima, Peru, with 109 cases (maternal ICU admissions) and 109 controls (obstetric patients not admitted to the ICU). Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and medical record review. Partner violence was assessed using the World Health Organization instrument. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the association between intimate partner violence and severe acute maternal morbidity. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher rate of intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy among cases (58.7%) than controls (27.5%). In multivariate analysis, intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy (aOR 3.83 (95% CI: 1.99-7.37)), being married (3.86 (1.27-11.73)), having <8 antenatal care visits (2.78 (1.14-6.80)), and having previous abortions (miscarriage, therapeutic, or unsafe) (1.69 (1.13-2.51)) were significantly associated with severe acute maternal morbidity. The ICU admission rate was 18.8 (per 1000 live births), and ICU maternal mortality was 1.7%. The perinatal mortality rate was higher in cases (9.3%) than in controls (1.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Intimate partner violence was associated with an increased risk of severe acute maternal morbidity. This suggests a more severe impact of intimate partner violence on pregnancy than has been previously identified.

DESIGN: Prospective clinical study of children with sepsis syndrome or septic shock. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS: 31 children with sepsis syndrome or septic shock. INTERVENTIONS: A tonometer was passed into the stomach via the orogastric route. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The following data were recorded at admission, 12, 24 and 48 h: heart rate, mean arterial pressure, arterial pH, base deficit, arterial lactate, gastric intramucosal pH (pHi) and DCO2 (intramucosal carbon dioxide tension minus arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide). The principal outcome measure was. The secondary outcome measure was the number of organ systems failing at 48 h after admission. There were 10 deaths and 21 survivors. No variable discriminated survival from death at presentation. Blood lactate level was the earliest discriminator of survival. Using univariate logistic regression, lactate discriminated survivors from those who died at 12 and 24 h after admission, but not at 48 h (p = 0.049, 0.044 and 0.062, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for lactate was 0.81, 0.88 and 0.89 at 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. At 12 h after admission, a blood lactate level > 3 mmol/l had a positive predictive value for death of 56% and a lactate level of 3 mmol/l or less had a positive predictive value for survival of 84%. At 24 h a lactate level > 3 mmol/l had a positive predictive value for death of 71% and a level of 3 mmol/l or less had a positive predictive value for survival of 86%. No other variable identified non-survivors from survivors at 12 h. Gastric tonometry could only be done on 19 of the 31 children, of whom 8 died and 11 survived. In these 19 children, DCO2 measured at 24 h, but not at 12 or 48 h, distinguished those who died from those who survived (p = 0.045 and p = 0.20, respectively). The area under the ROC curve for DCO2 measured at 24 h as a predictor of survival was 0.71. Neither the absolute value of pHi nor the trend of change in pHi at any time in the first 48 h identified survivors in this series. The mean arterial pressure distinguished survivors from non-survivors at 24 and 48 h (area under ROC curve = 0.80 and 0.78, respectively). The base deficit and heart rate did not identify non-survivors from survivors at any time in the first 48 h. CONCLUSIONS: Blood lactate level was the earliest predictor of outcome in children with sepsis. In this group of patients, gastric tonometry added little to the clinical information that could be derived more simply by other means.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a leading cause of death in the United States, claiming more than 215,000 lives every year. A primary condition observed in septic patients is the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils into the lung. Prior studies have shown differences in pulmonary neutrophil accumulation in C57BL/6J (B6) and A/J mice after endotoxic and septic shock. However, the mechanism by which neutrophils accumulate in the lung after polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture still remains to be fully elucidated. We show in this study that lung inflammation, characterized by neutrophil infiltration and expression of inflammatory cytokines, was aggravated in B6 as compared with A/J mice and correlated with a high expression of p19, the interleukin 23 (IL-23)-specific subunit. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide stimulation of B6- and A/J-derived macrophages, one of the main producers of IL-23 and IL-12, revealed that B6 mice favored the production of IL-23, whereas A/J-derived macrophages expressed higher levels of IL-12. In addition, expression of IL-17, known to be upregulated by IL-23, was also more elevated in the lung of B6 mice when compared with that in the lung of A/J mice. In contrast, pulmonary expression of interferon-\u03b3 was much more pronounced in A/J than that in B6 mice, which was most likely a result of a higher production of IL-12. The expression of the IL-17-dependent neutrophil recruitment factors chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 2 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was also higher in B6 mice. Altogether, these results suggest that increased activation of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway has detrimental effects on sepsis-induced lung inflammation, whereas activation of the IL-12/interferon-\u03b3 pathway may lead, in contrast, to less pronounced inflammatory events. These two pathways may become possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Current research on personality disorders strives to identify key behavioural and cognitive facets of patient functioning, to unravel the underlying root causes and maintenance mechanisms. This process often involves the application of social paradigms - however, these often only include momentary affective depictions rather than unfolding interactions. This constitutes a limitation in our capacity to probe core symptoms, and leaves potential findings uncovered which could help those who are in close relationships with affected individuals. Here, we deployed a novel task in which subjects interact with four unknown virtual partners in a turn-taking paradigm akin to a dance, and report on their experience with each. The virtual partners embody four combinations of low/high expressivity of positive/negative mood. Higher scores on our symptomatic measures of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were all linked to a general negative appraisal of all the interpersonal experiences. Moreover, the negative appraisal of the partner who displayed a high negative/low positive mood was tied with attachment anxiety and BPD symptoms. The extent to which subjects felt responsible for causing partners' distress was most strongly linked to attachment anxiety. Finally, we provide a fully-fledged exploration of move-by-move action latencies and click distances from partners. This analysis underscored slower movement initiation from anxiously attached individuals throughout all virtual interactions. In summary, we describe a novel paradigm for second-person neuroscience, which allowed both the replication of established results and the capture of new behavioural signatures associated with attachment anxiety, and discuss its limitations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most studies regarding late-onset sepsis (LOS) address selected populations (i.e., neonates with low birth weight or extremely preterm neonates). Studying all age groups is more suitable to assess the burden of single pathogens and their clinical relevance. METHODS: This is a retrospective regional study involving paediatric departments and NICUs in Emilia-Romagna (Italy). Regional laboratory databases were searched from 2009 to 2012. Records of infants (aged 4 to 90 days) with a positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture were retrospectively reviewed and analysed according to acquisition mode (whether hospital- or community-acquired). RESULTS: During the study period, there were 146,682 live births (LBs), with 296 patients experiencing 331 episodes of LOS (incidence rate: 2.3/1000 LBs). Brain lesions upon discharge from the hospital were found in 12.3% (40/296) of cases, with death occurring in 7.1% (23/296; 0.14/1000 LBs). With respect to full-term neonates, extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight neonates had very high risk of LOS and related mortality (> 100- and > 800-fold higher respectively). Hospital-acquired LOS (n = 209) was significantly associated with very low birth weight, extremely preterm birth, pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, and death (p< 0.01). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, catecholamine support (OR = 3.2), central venous line before LOS (OR = 14.9), and meningitis (OR = 44.7) were associated with brain lesions or death in hospital-acquired LOS (area under the ROC curve 0.81, H-L p = 0.41). Commonly identified pathogens included coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS n = 71, 21.4%), Escherichia coli (n = 50, 15.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 41, 12.4%) and Enterobacteriaceae (n = 41, 12.4%). Group B streptococcus was the predominant cause of meningitis (16 of 38 cases, 42%). Most pathogens were sensitive to first line antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first Italian data regarding late-onset sepsis (LOS) in all gestational age groups. Compared to full-term neonates, very high rates of LOS and mortality occurred in neonates with a lower birth weight and gestational age. Group B streptococcus was the leading cause of meningitis. Excluding CoNS, the predominant pathogens were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Neonates with hospital-acquired LOS had a worse outcome. Antibiotic associations, recommended for empirical treatment of hospital- or community-acquired LOS, were adequate.",

        "title": "Bulevirtide in the Treatment of Hepatitis Delta: Drug Discovery, Clinical Development and Place in Therapy.",
        "abstract": "It has been ten years since the identification of NTCP as the cell surface receptor for HBV and HDV entry into hepatocytes. The search for molecules interfering with the binding of NTCP and HBV/HDV led to design bulevirtide (BLV). This large polypeptide mimics a region of the pre-S1 HBsAg and blocks viral entry by inhibitory competition. BLV was initially tested in cell cultures, animal models and more recently in Phase I-III human trials (called 'MYRS'). As monotherapy or in combination with peginterferon, BLV is well tolerated and exhibits potent antiviral activity. Plasma viremia significantly declines and/or becomes undetectable in more than 75% of patients treated for >24 weeks. However, serum HBsAg concentrations remain unchanged. No selection of BLV resistance in HBV/HDV has been reported in vivo to date. BLV is administered subcutaneously once daily at doses between 2 and 10 mg. BLV received conditional approval in Europe in 2020 to treat chronic hepatitis delta. The advent of peginterferon lambda or new specific anti-HDV antivirals (lonafarnib, etc.) will open the door for combination therapies with BLV. Since there is no stable reservoir for HDV-RNA within infected hepatocytes, viral clearance might be achieved using antivirals for a minimum timeframe. This is what happens in hepatitis C combining several antivirals, curing nearly all patients treated for 3 months. Clearance of HDV-RNA genomes may occur despite HBV persistence as cccDNA or chromosome integrated HBV-DNA within hepatocytes. This is supported by cases of HDV elimination using BLV despite persistence of serum HBsAg. Another path for HDV cure will derive from achieving HBsAg clearance, the goal of new promising anti-HBV gene therapies (bepirovirsen, etc.). In summary, the advent of BLV has triggered a renovated interest for antiviral therapy in hepatitis delta. We envision combination therapies that will lead to HDV cure in the near future.",

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a safe and effective therapy for infection-related diarrhea which are mainly mediated by the loss of the microbial colonization, although there is concern that IC patients may be at higher risk of infectious complications related to FMT. And reports of FMT in IC children are limited. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe two cases of FMT in IC children with refractory diarrhea. One IC child had polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome and the other child had graft-versus-host disease. Both of the children had a long course of diarrhea and no response to traditional treatment. FMT was performed on both patients via nasojejunal tubes under guidance of gastroduodenoscopy. After FMT, the patients achieved remission of symptoms and neither of them had related infectious complications. Microbiota analysis showed that FMT resulted in reconstruction of a diverse microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: Use of FMT is safe and effective in treatment of refractory diarrhea in IC children with a damaged microbiota.",

Conventional MPS, caused by inborn deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes involved in GAG degradation, display various multisystemic symptoms-including progressive neurological complications, ophthalmological disorders, hearing loss, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary issues, cardiorespiratory problems, bone and joint abnormalities, dwarfism, and coarse facial features. Mucopolysaccharidosis-Plus Syndrome (MPSPS), an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the endo-lysosomal tethering protein VPS33A, shows additional renal and hematopoietic abnormalities (\"Plus symptoms\") uncommon in conventional MPS. Here, we analyze data from biochemical, histological, and physical examinations-particularly of blood counts and kidney function-to further characterize the clinical phenotype of MPSPS. A series of blood tests indicate hematopoietic symptoms including progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia, which correlate with histological observations of hypoplastic bone marrow. High urinary excretion of protein (caused by impairments in renal filtration), hypoalbuminemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, cholesterol, and uric acid indicate renal dysfunction. Histological analyses of MPSPS kidneys similarly suggest the extensive destruction of glomerular structures by foamy podocytes. Height and weight did not significantly deviate from the average, but in some cases, growth began to decline at around six months or one year of age.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transmembrane (TMEM) protein genes are a class of proteins that spans membranes and function to many physiological processes. However, there is very little known about TMEM gene expression, especially in cancer tissue. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequence may facilitate the understanding of this poorly characterized protein genes in PDAC. METHODS: We selected the TMEM family genes through the Human Protein Atlas and characterized their expression by single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. Identification of the key TMEM genes was performed through three machine learning algorithms: LASSO, SVM-RFE and RF-SRC. Then, we established TMEM gene riskscore and estimate its implication in predicting survival and response to systematic therapy. Additionally, we explored the difference and impact of TMEM gene expression in PDAC through immunohistochemistry and cell line research. RESULTS: 5 key TMEM genes (ANO1, TMEM59, TMEM204, TMEM205, TMEM92) were selected based on the single-cell analysis and machine learning survival outcomes. Patients stratified into the high and low-risk groups based on TMEM riskscore, were observed with distinct overall survival in internal and external datasets. Moreover, through bulk RNA-sequence and immunohistochemical staining we verified the protein expression of TMEM genes in PDAC and revealed TMEM92 as an essential regulator of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSION: Our study on TMEM gene expression and behavior in PDAC has revealed unique characteristics, offering potential for precise therapeutic approaches. Insights into molecular mechanisms expand understanding of PDAC complexity and TMEM gene roles. Such knowledge may inform targeted therapy development, benefiting patients.",

DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). PATIENTS: Ninety-four children. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Leucocyte count, PCT and CRP were measured when considered necessary during the PICU stay. Patients were classified, when PCT and CRP were measured, into one of six categories (negative, SIRS, localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock) according to the definitions of the American College of Chest Physicians /Society of Critical Care Medicine. A total of 359 patient day episodes were obtained. Leucocyte count did not differ across the six diagnostic classes considered. Median plasma PCT concentrations were 0.17, 0.43, 0.79, 1.80, 15.40 and 19.13 ng/ml in negative, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock groups, respectively, whereas median plasma CRP concentrations were 1.35, 3.80, 6.45, 5.70, 7.60 and 16.2 mg/dl, respectively. The area under the ROC curve for the diagnosis of septic patients was 0.532 for leucocyte count (95% CI, 0.462-0.602), 0.750 for CRP (95% CI, 0.699-0.802) and 0.912 for PCT (95% CI, 0.882-0.943). We obtained four groups using CRP values and five groups using PCT values that classified a significant percentage of patients according to the severity of the different SIRS groups. CONCLUSIONS: PCT is a better diagnostic marker of sepsis in critically ill children than CRP. The CRP, and especially PCT, may become a helpful clinical tool to stratify patients with SIRS according to disease severity.",

BCMA is highly expressed on plasmablasts and plasma cells from multiple myeloma (MM) patient samples. We developed a BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody (teclistamab [JNJ-64007957]) to recruit and activate T cells to kill BCMA-expressing MM cells. Teclistamab induced cytotoxicity of BCMA+ MM cell lines in vitro (H929 cells, 50% effective concentration [EC50] = 0.15 nM; MM.1R cells, EC50 = 0.06 nM; RPMI 8226 cells, EC50 = 0.45 nM) with concomitant T-cell activation (H929 cells, EC50 = 0.21 nM; MM.1R cells, EC50 = 0.1 nM; RPMI 8226 cells, EC50 = 0.28 nM) and cytokine release. This activity was further increased in the presence of a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor (LY-411575). Teclistamab also depleted BCMA+ cells in bone marrow samples from MM patients in an ex vivo assay with an average EC50 value of 1.7 nM. Under more physiological conditions using healthy human whole blood, teclistamab mediated dose-dependent lysis of H929 cells and activation of T cells. Antitumor activity of teclistamab was also observed in 2 BCMA+ MM murine xenograft models inoculated with human T cells (tumor inhibition with H929 model and tumor regression with the RPMI 8226 model) compared with vehicle and antibody controls. The specific and potent activity of teclistamab against BCMA-expressing cells from MM cell lines, patient samples, and MM xenograft models warrant further evaluation of this bispecific antibody for the treatment of MM.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Laparoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis but the need for visual evidence of the disease is a major stumbling-block for both effective clinical management of affected patients as well as for research into this common and debilitating reproductive disease. Laparoscopy is invasive and often causes a delay in diagnosis and treatment, especially in symptomatic teenagers and young women. Moreover, the visual inspection of the pelvis has major limitations, particularly for the diagnosis of retroperitoneal lesions. It is therefore not surprising that considerable efforts are being made to improve imaging techniques and to evaluate the diagnostic value of potential molecular markers of disease. RECENT FINDINGS: High-resolution transvaginal ultrasonography and, in selected cases, magnetic resonance imaging improve the diagnosis of retroperitoneal pelvic endometriosis as well as the identification of lesions that involve pelvic organs. A variety of serum and endometrial markers are being evaluated for their diagnostic potential, particularly in endometriosis associated infertility. The first gene profiling studies are showing positive results and proteomic technology is being applied to identify novel diagnostic protein expression patterns. SUMMARY: Current imaging techniques, such as transvaginal ultrasonography, are useful to screen the pelvis for the presence of retroperitoneal endometriosis but fail to diagnose peritoneal lesions, small ovarian endometriomas and adhesions. Postgenomic technologies and identification of novel serum and endometrial markers are likely to revolutionize future diagnosis of endometriosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High rates of maternal mortality and intimate partner violence (IPV) are both major worldwide health challenges. Evidence from single-country samples suggests that IPV may be an important risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services, but there is little large-scale evidence on this association. This paper evaluates whether IPV is a risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services in a large cross-country sample, and also compiles evidence on the relative effects of different forms of IPV. METHODS: We analyze the association between intimate partner violence\u00a0and utilization of maternal health care, using a dataset compiling all Demographic and Health Surveys that report data on intimate partner violence. Using data on 166,685 women observed in 36 countries between 2005 and 2016, we estimate logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between lifetime experience of IPV and utilization of antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery care, and postnatal care. We estimate both unadjusted models and models adjusted for geographic and sociodemographic characteristics that are generally correlated with utilization of maternal health care (including age, education, number of children, wealth status, marital status, and urbanity). RESULTS: Lifetime experience of any IPV is associated with decreased use of maternal health services in a broad sample of births observed in lower and middle-income countries: in particular, the utilization of four or more ANC visits, the number of ANC visits, and the utilization of facility care at birth. This association remains statistically significant even after adjusting for country of residence, subnational region of residence, and additional individual-level covariates; however, there is no statistically significant association between experience of any IPV and postnatal care. The only form of IPV significantly associated with care utilization is physical IPV. CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing physical intimate partner violence show lower levels of utilization of maternal health services in a large sample of developing and middle-income countries. Given that reduced utilization of maternal health services is correlated with maternal and neonatal health outcomes, this pattern suggests that IPV prevention may be an important component of interventions targeting enhanced maternal and neonatal health.",

GSEA is especially useful when gene expression changes in a given microarray data set is minimal or moderate. RESULTS: We developed a modified gene set enrichment analysis method based on a parametric statistical analysis model. Compared with GSEA, the parametric analysis of gene set enrichment (PAGE) detected a larger number of significantly altered gene sets and their p-values were lower than the corresponding p-values calculated by GSEA. Because PAGE uses normal distribution for statistical inference, it requires less computation than GSEA, which needs repeated computation of the permutated data set. PAGE was able to detect significantly changed gene sets from microarray data irrespective of different Affymetrix probe level analysis methods or different microarray platforms. Comparison of two aged muscle microarray data sets at gene set level using PAGE revealed common biological themes better than comparison at individual gene level. CONCLUSION: PAGE was statistically more sensitive and required much less computational effort than GSEA, it could identify significantly changed biological themes from microarray data irrespective of analysis methods or microarray platforms, and it was useful in comparison of multiple microarray data sets.

Autologous MSCs may be a better cell source and have been studied for the treatment of cerebral palsy because of their functions in tissue repair and the regulation of immunological processes. METHODS: To assess neural stem cell-like (NSC-like) cells derived from autologous marrow mesenchymal stem cells as a novel treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe cerebral palsy, a total of 60 cerebral palsy patients were enrolled in this open-label, non-randomised, observer-blinded controlled clinical study with a 6-months follow-up. For the transplantation group, a total of 30 cerebral palsy patients received an autologous NSC-like cells transplantation (1-2 \u00d7 107 cells into the subarachnoid cavity) and rehabilitation treatments whereas 30 patients in the control group only received rehabilitation treatment. RESULTS: We recorded the gross motor function measurement scores, language quotients, and adverse events up to 6 months post-treatment. The gross motor function measurement scores in the transplantation group were significantly higher at month 3 (the score increase was 42.6, 95% CI: 9.8-75.3, P=.011) and month 6 (the score increase was 58.6, 95% CI: 25.8-91.4, P=.001) post-treatment compared with the baseline scores. The increase in the Gross Motor Function Measurement scores in the control group was not significant. The increases in the language quotients at months 1, 3, and 6 post-treatment were not statistically significant when compared with the baseline quotients in both groups. All the 60 patients survived, and none of the patients experienced serious adverse events or complications. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that NSC-like cells are safe and effective for the treatment of motor deficits related to cerebral palsy. Further randomised clinical trials are necessary to establish the efficacy of this procedure.",

        "title": "Intimate partner violence and maternal health services utilization: evidence from 36 National Household Surveys.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High rates of maternal mortality and intimate partner violence (IPV) are both major worldwide health challenges. Evidence from single-country samples suggests that IPV may be an important risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services, but there is little large-scale evidence on this association. This paper evaluates whether IPV is a risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services in a large cross-country sample, and also compiles evidence on the relative effects of different forms of IPV. METHODS: We analyze the association between intimate partner violence\u00a0and utilization of maternal health care, using a dataset compiling all Demographic and Health Surveys that report data on intimate partner violence. Using data on 166,685 women observed in 36 countries between 2005 and 2016, we estimate logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between lifetime experience of IPV and utilization of antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery care, and postnatal care. We estimate both unadjusted models and models adjusted for geographic and sociodemographic characteristics that are generally correlated with utilization of maternal health care (including age, education, number of children, wealth status, marital status, and urbanity). RESULTS: Lifetime experience of any IPV is associated with decreased use of maternal health services in a broad sample of births observed in lower and middle-income countries: in particular, the utilization of four or more ANC visits, the number of ANC visits, and the utilization of facility care at birth. This association remains statistically significant even after adjusting for country of residence, subnational region of residence, and additional individual-level covariates; however, there is no statistically significant association between experience of any IPV and postnatal care. The only form of IPV significantly associated with care utilization is physical IPV. CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing physical intimate partner violence show lower levels of utilization of maternal health services in a large sample of developing and middle-income countries. Given that reduced utilization of maternal health services is correlated with maternal and neonatal health outcomes, this pattern suggests that IPV prevention may be an important component of interventions targeting enhanced maternal and neonatal health.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a microarray data analysis method that uses predefined gene sets and ranks of genes to identify significant biological changes in microarray data sets. GSEA is especially useful when gene expression changes in a given microarray data set is minimal or moderate. RESULTS: We developed a modified gene set enrichment analysis method based on a parametric statistical analysis model. Compared with GSEA, the parametric analysis of gene set enrichment (PAGE) detected a larger number of significantly altered gene sets and their p-values were lower than the corresponding p-values calculated by GSEA. Because PAGE uses normal distribution for statistical inference, it requires less computation than GSEA, which needs repeated computation of the permutated data set. PAGE was able to detect significantly changed gene sets from microarray data irrespective of different Affymetrix probe level analysis methods or different microarray platforms. Comparison of two aged muscle microarray data sets at gene set level using PAGE revealed common biological themes better than comparison at individual gene level. CONCLUSION: PAGE was statistically more sensitive and required much less computational effort than GSEA, it could identify significantly changed biological themes from microarray data irrespective of analysis methods or microarray platforms, and it was useful in comparison of multiple microarray data sets. We offer PAGE as a useful microarray analysis method.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite a high mortality rate in childhood, there is limited evidence on the causes and outcomes of paediatric bloodstream infections from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize the bacterial causes of paediatric bloodstream infections in LMICs and their resistance profile. METHODS: We searched Pubmed and Embase databases between January 1st 1990 and October 30th 2019, combining MeSH and free-text terms for \"sepsis\" and \"low-middle-income countries\" in children. Two reviewers screened articles and performed data extraction to identify studies investigating children (1\u2009month-18\u2009years), with at least one blood culture. The main outcomes of interests were the rate of positive blood cultures, the distribution of bacterial pathogens, the resistance patterns and the case-fatality rate. The proportions obtained from each study were pooled using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation, and a random-effect meta-analysis model was used. RESULTS: We identified 2403 eligible studies, 17 were included in the final review including 52,915 children (11 in Africa and 6 in Asia). The overall percentage of positive blood culture was 19.1% [95% CI: 12.0-27.5%]; 15.5% [8.4-24.4%] in Africa and 28.0% [13.2-45.8%] in Asia. A total of 4836 bacterial isolates were included in the studies; 2974 were Gram-negative (63.9% [52.2-74.9]) and 1858 were Gram-positive (35.8% [24.9-47.5]). In Asia,  CONCLUSIONS: We observed a marked variation in pathogen distribution and their resistance profiles between Asia and Africa. Very limited data is available on underlying risk factors for bacteraemia, patterns of treatment of multidrug-resistant infections and predictors of adverse outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Current research on personality disorders strives to identify key behavioural and cognitive facets of patient functioning, to unravel the underlying root causes and maintenance mechanisms. This process often involves the application of social paradigms - however, these often only include momentary affective depictions rather than unfolding interactions. This constitutes a limitation in our capacity to probe core symptoms, and leaves potential findings uncovered which could help those who are in close relationships with affected individuals. Here, we deployed a novel task in which subjects interact with four unknown virtual partners in a turn-taking paradigm akin to a dance, and report on their experience with each. The virtual partners embody four combinations of low/high expressivity of positive/negative mood. Higher scores on our symptomatic measures of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were all linked to a general negative appraisal of all the interpersonal experiences. Moreover, the negative appraisal of the partner who displayed a high negative/low positive mood was tied with attachment anxiety and BPD symptoms. The extent to which subjects felt responsible for causing partners' distress was most strongly linked to attachment anxiety. Finally, we provide a fully-fledged exploration of move-by-move action latencies and click distances from partners. This analysis underscored slower movement initiation from anxiously attached individuals throughout all virtual interactions. In summary, we describe a novel paradigm for second-person neuroscience, which allowed both the replication of established results and the capture of new behavioural signatures associated with attachment anxiety, and discuss its limitations.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To analyse the clinical value of procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and leucocyte count in the diagnosis of paediatric sepsis and in the stratification of patients according to severity. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). PATIENTS: Ninety-four children. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Leucocyte count, PCT and CRP were measured when considered necessary during the PICU stay. Patients were classified, when PCT and CRP were measured, into one of six categories (negative, SIRS, localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock) according to the definitions of the American College of Chest Physicians /Society of Critical Care Medicine. A total of 359 patient day episodes were obtained. Leucocyte count did not differ across the six diagnostic classes considered. Median plasma PCT concentrations were 0.17, 0.43, 0.79, 1.80, 15.40 and 19.13 ng/ml in negative, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock groups, respectively, whereas median plasma CRP concentrations were 1.35, 3.80, 6.45, 5.70, 7.60 and 16.2 mg/dl, respectively. The area under the ROC curve for the diagnosis of septic patients was 0.532 for leucocyte count (95% CI, 0.462-0.602), 0.750 for CRP (95% CI, 0.699-0.802) and 0.912 for PCT (95% CI, 0.882-0.943). We obtained four groups using CRP values and five groups using PCT values that classified a significant percentage of patients according to the severity of the different SIRS groups. CONCLUSIONS: PCT is a better diagnostic marker of sepsis in critically ill children than CRP. The CRP, and especially PCT, may become a helpful clinical tool to stratify patients with SIRS according to disease severity.",

        "title": "Elevated expression of IL-23/IL-17 pathway-related mediators correlates with exacerbation of pulmonary inflammation during polymicrobial sepsis.",
        "abstract": "Sepsis is a leading cause of death in the United States, claiming more than 215,000 lives every year. A primary condition observed in septic patients is the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils into the lung. Prior studies have shown differences in pulmonary neutrophil accumulation in C57BL/6J (B6) and A/J mice after endotoxic and septic shock. However, the mechanism by which neutrophils accumulate in the lung after polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture still remains to be fully elucidated. We show in this study that lung inflammation, characterized by neutrophil infiltration and expression of inflammatory cytokines, was aggravated in B6 as compared with A/J mice and correlated with a high expression of p19, the interleukin 23 (IL-23)-specific subunit. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide stimulation of B6- and A/J-derived macrophages, one of the main producers of IL-23 and IL-12, revealed that B6 mice favored the production of IL-23, whereas A/J-derived macrophages expressed higher levels of IL-12. In addition, expression of IL-17, known to be upregulated by IL-23, was also more elevated in the lung of B6 mice when compared with that in the lung of A/J mice. In contrast, pulmonary expression of interferon-\u03b3 was much more pronounced in A/J than that in B6 mice, which was most likely a result of a higher production of IL-12. The expression of the IL-17-dependent neutrophil recruitment factors chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 2 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was also higher in B6 mice. Altogether, these results suggest that increased activation of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway has detrimental effects on sepsis-induced lung inflammation, whereas activation of the IL-12/interferon-\u03b3 pathway may lead, in contrast, to less pronounced inflammatory events. These two pathways may become possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.",

However, there is very little known about TMEM gene expression, especially in cancer tissue. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequence may facilitate the understanding of this poorly characterized protein genes in PDAC. METHODS: We selected the TMEM family genes through the Human Protein Atlas and characterized their expression by single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. Identification of the key TMEM genes was performed through three machine learning algorithms: LASSO, SVM-RFE and RF-SRC. Then, we established TMEM gene riskscore and estimate its implication in predicting survival and response to systematic therapy. Additionally, we explored the difference and impact of TMEM gene expression in PDAC through immunohistochemistry and cell line research. RESULTS: 5 key TMEM genes (ANO1, TMEM59, TMEM204, TMEM205, TMEM92) were selected based on the single-cell analysis and machine learning survival outcomes. Patients stratified into the high and low-risk groups based on TMEM riskscore, were observed with distinct overall survival in internal and external datasets. Moreover, through bulk RNA-sequence and immunohistochemical staining we verified the protein expression of TMEM genes in PDAC and revealed TMEM92 as an essential regulator of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSION: Our study on TMEM gene expression and behavior in PDAC has revealed unique characteristics, offering potential for precise therapeutic approaches. Insights into molecular mechanisms expand understanding of PDAC complexity and TMEM gene roles. Such knowledge may inform targeted therapy development, benefiting patients.",

The effectiveness of many other interventions used in the treatment of cerebral palsy has not been clearly established based on well-controlled trials. These include: sensory integration, body-weight support treadmill training, conductive education, constraint-induced therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and the Vojta method. This article provides an overview of salient aspects of popular interventions used in the management of children with cerebral palsy.",

Several potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue have been proposed, including sleep patterns, autonomic nervous system abnormalities and biological complexity. Inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the most promising mechanisms through which malnutrition may cause fatigue. Not surprisingly, fatigue is highly prevalent in inflammatory conditions (e.g. COVID-19 infection). The nutritional status may also represent a critical factor in the development and presentation of fatigue, which may mimic the exhaustion of the individual's metabolic reserves. For example, the insufficient dietary intake of energy and proteins may determine the catabolism of body fat and muscles, disrupt the homeostatic balance and cause the onset of fatigue. It is necessary to conduct research on fatigue. By characterising its pathophysiological mechanisms, it will be possible to (1) support the design and development of targeted interventions, (2) improve the quality of life of many persons by acting on the symptom and (3) reduce the direct and indirect costs of a burdening condition typical of advancing age.

        "abstract": "Current research on personality disorders strives to identify key behavioural and cognitive facets of patient functioning, to unravel the underlying root causes and maintenance mechanisms. This process often involves the application of social paradigms - however, these often only include momentary affective depictions rather than unfolding interactions. This constitutes a limitation in our capacity to probe core symptoms, and leaves potential findings uncovered which could help those who are in close relationships with affected individuals. Here, we deployed a novel task in which subjects interact with four unknown virtual partners in a turn-taking paradigm akin to a dance, and report on their experience with each. The virtual partners embody four combinations of low/high expressivity of positive/negative mood. Higher scores on our symptomatic measures of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were all linked to a general negative appraisal of all the interpersonal experiences. Moreover, the negative appraisal of the partner who displayed a high negative/low positive mood was tied with attachment anxiety and BPD symptoms. The extent to which subjects felt responsible for causing partners' distress was most strongly linked to attachment anxiety. Finally, we provide a fully-fledged exploration of move-by-move action latencies and click distances from partners. This analysis underscored slower movement initiation from anxiously attached individuals throughout all virtual interactions. In summary, we describe a novel paradigm for second-person neuroscience, which allowed both the replication of established results and the capture of new behavioural signatures associated with attachment anxiety, and discuss its limitations.",

However, there is very little known about TMEM gene expression, especially in cancer tissue. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequence may facilitate the understanding of this poorly characterized protein genes in PDAC. METHODS: We selected the TMEM family genes through the Human Protein Atlas and characterized their expression by single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. Identification of the key TMEM genes was performed through three machine learning algorithms: LASSO, SVM-RFE and RF-SRC. Then, we established TMEM gene riskscore and estimate its implication in predicting survival and response to systematic therapy. Additionally, we explored the difference and impact of TMEM gene expression in PDAC through immunohistochemistry and cell line research. RESULTS: 5 key TMEM genes (ANO1, TMEM59, TMEM204, TMEM205, TMEM92) were selected based on the single-cell analysis and machine learning survival outcomes. Patients stratified into the high and low-risk groups based on TMEM riskscore, were observed with distinct overall survival in internal and external datasets. Moreover, through bulk RNA-sequence and immunohistochemical staining we verified the protein expression of TMEM genes in PDAC and revealed TMEM92 as an essential regulator of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSION: Our study on TMEM gene expression and behavior in PDAC has revealed unique characteristics, offering potential for precise therapeutic approaches. Insights into molecular mechanisms expand understanding of PDAC complexity and TMEM gene roles. Such knowledge may inform targeted therapy development, benefiting patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High rates of maternal mortality and intimate partner violence (IPV) are both major worldwide health challenges. Evidence from single-country samples suggests that IPV may be an important risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services, but there is little large-scale evidence on this association. This paper evaluates whether IPV is a risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services in a large cross-country sample, and also compiles evidence on the relative effects of different forms of IPV. METHODS: We analyze the association between intimate partner violence\u00a0and utilization of maternal health care, using a dataset compiling all Demographic and Health Surveys that report data on intimate partner violence. Using data on 166,685 women observed in 36 countries between 2005 and 2016, we estimate logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between lifetime experience of IPV and utilization of antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery care, and postnatal care. We estimate both unadjusted models and models adjusted for geographic and sociodemographic characteristics that are generally correlated with utilization of maternal health care (including age, education, number of children, wealth status, marital status, and urbanity). RESULTS: Lifetime experience of any IPV is associated with decreased use of maternal health services in a broad sample of births observed in lower and middle-income countries: in particular, the utilization of four or more ANC visits, the number of ANC visits, and the utilization of facility care at birth. This association remains statistically significant even after adjusting for country of residence, subnational region of residence, and additional individual-level covariates; however, there is no statistically significant association between experience of any IPV and postnatal care. The only form of IPV significantly associated with care utilization is physical IPV. CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing physical intimate partner violence show lower levels of utilization of maternal health services in a large sample of developing and middle-income countries. Given that reduced utilization of maternal health services is correlated with maternal and neonatal health outcomes, this pattern suggests that IPV prevention may be an important component of interventions targeting enhanced maternal and neonatal health.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite a high mortality rate in childhood, there is limited evidence on the causes and outcomes of paediatric bloodstream infections from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize the bacterial causes of paediatric bloodstream infections in LMICs and their resistance profile. METHODS: We searched Pubmed and Embase databases between January 1st 1990 and October 30th 2019, combining MeSH and free-text terms for \"sepsis\" and \"low-middle-income countries\" in children. Two reviewers screened articles and performed data extraction to identify studies investigating children (1\u2009month-18\u2009years), with at least one blood culture. The main outcomes of interests were the rate of positive blood cultures, the distribution of bacterial pathogens, the resistance patterns and the case-fatality rate. The proportions obtained from each study were pooled using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation, and a random-effect meta-analysis model was used. RESULTS: We identified 2403 eligible studies, 17 were included in the final review including 52,915 children (11 in Africa and 6 in Asia).

DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). PATIENTS: Ninety-four children. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Leucocyte count, PCT and CRP were measured when considered necessary during the PICU stay. Patients were classified, when PCT and CRP were measured, into one of six categories (negative, SIRS, localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock) according to the definitions of the American College of Chest Physicians /Society of Critical Care Medicine. A total of 359 patient day episodes were obtained. Leucocyte count did not differ across the six diagnostic classes considered. Median plasma PCT concentrations were 0.17, 0.43, 0.79, 1.80, 15.40 and 19.13 ng/ml in negative, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock groups, respectively, whereas median plasma CRP concentrations were 1.35, 3.80, 6.45, 5.70, 7.60 and 16.2 mg/dl, respectively. The area under the ROC curve for the diagnosis of septic patients was 0.532 for leucocyte count (95% CI, 0.462-0.602), 0.750 for CRP (95% CI, 0.699-0.802) and 0.912 for PCT (95% CI, 0.882-0.943). We obtained four groups using CRP values and five groups using PCT values that classified a significant percentage of patients according to the severity of the different SIRS groups.

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a leading cause of death in the United States, claiming more than 215,000 lives every year. A primary condition observed in septic patients is the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils into the lung. Prior studies have shown differences in pulmonary neutrophil accumulation in C57BL/6J (B6) and A/J mice after endotoxic and septic shock. However, the mechanism by which neutrophils accumulate in the lung after polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture still remains to be fully elucidated. We show in this study that lung inflammation, characterized by neutrophil infiltration and expression of inflammatory cytokines, was aggravated in B6 as compared with A/J mice and correlated with a high expression of p19, the interleukin 23 (IL-23)-specific subunit. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide stimulation of B6- and A/J-derived macrophages, one of the main producers of IL-23 and IL-12, revealed that B6 mice favored the production of IL-23, whereas A/J-derived macrophages expressed higher levels of IL-12. In addition, expression of IL-17, known to be upregulated by IL-23, was also more elevated in the lung of B6 mice when compared with that in the lung of A/J mice. In contrast, pulmonary expression of interferon-\u03b3 was much more pronounced in A/J than that in B6 mice, which was most likely a result of a higher production of IL-12. The expression of the IL-17-dependent neutrophil recruitment factors chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 2 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was also higher in B6 mice. Altogether, these results suggest that increased activation of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway has detrimental effects on sepsis-induced lung inflammation, whereas activation of the IL-12/interferon-\u03b3 pathway may lead, in contrast, to less pronounced inflammatory events. These two pathways may become possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.",

Some, but not all, prior studies suggest that IPV is associated with increased risks of maternal medical conditions such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy which are leading causes of maternal mortality worldwide. We assessed the relation between IPV and risk of preeclampsia among Peruvian women. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a case-control study at two large hospitals in Lima, Peru. Preeclampsia cases were 339 women with pregnancy-induced hypertension and proteinuria (i.e., preeclampsia). Controls were 337 normotensive women. Information concerning women's exposure to physical and emotional violence during pregnancy was collected during in-person interviews conducted after delivery and while patients were in hospital. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from logistic regression models. RESULTS: The prevalence of IPV was 43.1% among cases and 24.3% among controls. Compared with those reporting never exposure to IPV during pregnancy, women reporting any exposure had a 2.4-fold increased risk of preeclampsia (OR=2.4; 95% CI: 1.7-3.3). The association was strengthened slightly after adjusting for maternal age, parity and pre-pregnancy adiposity (OR=2.7; 95% CI: 1.9-3.9). Emotional abuse in the absence of physical violence was associated with a 3.2-fold (95% CI: 2.1-4.9) increased risk of preeclampsia. Emotional and physical abuse during pregnancy was associated with a 1.9-fold increased risk of preeclampsia (95% CI: 1.1-3.5). CONCLUSIONS: IPV among pregnant women is common and is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia. These data support recent calls for coordinated global health efforts to prevent violence against women.",

        "title": "Intimate partner violence and maternal health services utilization: evidence from 36 National Household Surveys.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High rates of maternal mortality and intimate partner violence (IPV) are both major worldwide health challenges. Evidence from single-country samples suggests that IPV may be an important risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services, but there is little large-scale evidence on this association. This paper evaluates whether IPV is a risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services in a large cross-country sample, and also compiles evidence on the relative effects of different forms of IPV. METHODS: We analyze the association between intimate partner violence\u00a0and utilization of maternal health care, using a dataset compiling all Demographic and Health Surveys that report data on intimate partner violence. Using data on 166,685 women observed in 36 countries between 2005 and 2016, we estimate logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between lifetime experience of IPV and utilization of antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery care, and postnatal care. We estimate both unadjusted models and models adjusted for geographic and sociodemographic characteristics that are generally correlated with utilization of maternal health care (including age, education, number of children, wealth status, marital status, and urbanity). RESULTS: Lifetime experience of any IPV is associated with decreased use of maternal health services in a broad sample of births observed in lower and middle-income countries: in particular, the utilization of four or more ANC visits, the number of ANC visits, and the utilization of facility care at birth. This association remains statistically significant even after adjusting for country of residence, subnational region of residence, and additional individual-level covariates; however, there is no statistically significant association between experience of any IPV and postnatal care. The only form of IPV significantly associated with care utilization is physical IPV. CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing physical intimate partner violence show lower levels of utilization of maternal health services in a large sample of developing and middle-income countries. Given that reduced utilization of maternal health services is correlated with maternal and neonatal health outcomes, this pattern suggests that IPV prevention may be an important component of interventions targeting enhanced maternal and neonatal health.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stem cell therapy is a promising treatment for cerebral palsy, which refers to a category of brain diseases that are associated with chronic motor disability in children. Autologous MSCs may be a better cell source and have been studied for the treatment of cerebral palsy because of their functions in tissue repair and the regulation of immunological processes. METHODS: To assess neural stem cell-like (NSC-like) cells derived from autologous marrow mesenchymal stem cells as a novel treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe cerebral palsy, a total of 60 cerebral palsy patients were enrolled in this open-label, non-randomised, observer-blinded controlled clinical study with a 6-months follow-up. For the transplantation group, a total of 30 cerebral palsy patients received an autologous NSC-like cells transplantation (1-2 \u00d7 107 cells into the subarachnoid cavity) and rehabilitation treatments whereas 30 patients in the control group only received rehabilitation treatment. RESULTS: We recorded the gross motor function measurement scores, language quotients, and adverse events up to 6 months post-treatment. The gross motor function measurement scores in the transplantation group were significantly higher at month 3 (the score increase was 42.6, 95% CI: 9.8-75.3, P=.011) and month 6 (the score increase was 58.6, 95% CI: 25.8-91.4, P=.001) post-treatment compared with the baseline scores. The increase in the Gross Motor Function Measurement scores in the control group was not significant. The increases in the language quotients at months 1, 3, and 6 post-treatment were not statistically significant when compared with the baseline quotients in both groups. All the 60 patients survived, and none of the patients experienced serious adverse events or complications. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that NSC-like cells are safe and effective for the treatment of motor deficits related to cerebral palsy. Further randomised clinical trials are necessary to establish the efficacy of this procedure.",

This results in reversible suppression of spermatogenesis and marked decrease in sperm output in the ejaculate and preventing pregnancy in the female partner. PRIOR STUDIES: Studies of testosterone administered alone or in combination of another gonadotropin suppressive agent such as a progestin or gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog showed decisively that the exogenous hormone administrations are effective in suppressing sperm output with few adverse events that are not anticipated. In contraceptive efficacy studies, testosterone alone or combined with a progestin are as effective in preventing pregnancies as female contraceptive methods. CONCLUSION: Hormone combinations for male contraception are in late-phase clinical trials and hold the promise of being the new, reversible contraception method for men in over half a century.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In this 10th European IVF-monitoring (EIM) report, the results of assisted reproductive techniques from treatments initiated in Europe during 2006 are presented. Data were mainly collected from existing national registers. METHODS: From 32 countries, 998 clinics reported 458 759 treatment cycles including: IVF (117 318), ICSI (232 844), frozen embryo replacement (FER, 86 059), egg donation (ED, 12 685), preimplantation genetic diagnosis/screening (6561), in vitro maturation (247) and frozen oocytes replacements (3498). Overall this represents a 9.7% increase in activity since 2005, which is partly due to an increase in registers (seven more countries with complete coverage). European data on intrauterine insemination using husband/partner's (IUI-H) and donor (IUI-D) semen were reported from 22 countries. A total of 134 261 IUI-H and 24 339 IUI-D cycles were included. RESULTS: In 20 countries, where all clinics reported to the IVF register, a total of 359 110 assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles were performed in a population of 422.5 million, corresponding to 850 cycles per million inhabitants. For IVF, the clinical pregnancy rates per aspiration and per transfer were 29.0 and 32.4%, respectively. For ICSI, the corresponding rates were 29.9 and 33.0%. After IUI-H the delivery rate was 9.2% in women below 40. After IVF and ICSI the distribution of transfer of one, two, three and four or more embryos was 22.1, 57.3, 19.0 and 1.6%, respectively. Compared with 2005, fewer embryos were replaced per transfer, but significant national differences in practice were apparent. The proportion of singleton, twin and triplet deliveries after IVF and ICSI combined was 79.2, 19.9 and 0.9%, respectively. This gives a total multiple delivery rates of 20.8% compared with 21.8% in 2005 and 22.7% in 2004. IUI-H in women below 40 years of age resulted in 10.6% twin and 0.6% triplet pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous years, the reported number of ART cycles in Europe has increased, pregnancy rates have increased marginally, even though fewer embryos were transferred and the multiple delivery rates have declined.",

        "title": "Family Talk versus usual services in improving child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness (PRIMERA-Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parental mental illness is common and can lead to dependent children incurring a high risk of developing mental disorders, physical illness, and impaired educational and occupational outcomes. Family Talk is one of the better known interventions designed to prevent the intergenerational transmission of mental illness. However, its evidence base is small, with few robust independent randomised controlled trials, and no associated process or cost evaluations. The PRIMERA (Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children) research programme involves a mixed method evaluation of Family Talk which is being delivered in mental health settings in Ireland to improve child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness. METHODS: The study comprises a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT), with nested economic and process evaluations, to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness and implementation mechanisms of Family Talk compared to usual services. The study is being conducted in 15 adult and child mental health settings in Ireland. Families with a parent with mental illness, and children aged 5-18\u2009years (n\u2009=\u2009144 families) will be randomised to either the 7-session Family Talk programme (n\u2009=\u200996) or to standard care (n\u2009=\u200948) using a 2:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcomes are child psychosocial functioning and family functioning. Secondary outcomes are as follows: understanding and experience of parental mental illness, parental mental health, child and parental resilience, partner wellbeing and service utilisation. Blind assessments will take place at pre-intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Given the prevalence and burden of intergenerational mental illness, it is imperative that prevention through evidence-based interventions becomes a public health priority. The current study will provide an important contribution to the international evidence base for Family Talk whilst also helping to identify key implementation lessons in the scaling up of Family Talk, and other similar interventions, within routine mental health settings.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess men's preferences for healthcare provider from whom they would obtain hormonal male contraceptive (HMC) methods. STUDY DESIGN: We asked participants from 3 clinical trials of investigational HMC methods-an oral pill (11\u03b2-Methyl-19-nortestosterone-17\u03b2-dodecylcarbonate, 11\u03b2-MNTDC), intramuscular or subcutaneous injection (Dimethandrolone undecanoate), and transdermal gel (Nestorone and testosterone)-to rank their top 3 preferred HMC providers from a list including: men's health doctor (urologist/andrologist), hormonal doctor (endocrinologist), reproductive health doctor (OB/GYN), family planning clinician (community health worker, midwife, nurse practitioner), regular doctor (family medicine/internal medicine), and community pharmacist. We examined preferences based on their rankings and conducted bivariate analyses. Collapsing the various specialists (men's health doctor, hormonal doctor, reproductive health doctor, and family planning clinician) into a single provider type, we examined participant demographics against provider preference (regular doctor, pharmacist, or specialist). RESULTS: Participants across the 3 trials (n\u00a0=\u00a0124) ranked their regular doctor (44%) and community pharmacist (18%) as their most preferred HMC provider; these preferences did not differ significantly by trial and drug formulation. Specialists in family planning (13%), men's health (12%), reproductive health (10%), and hormones (4%) were least frequently ranked as their preferred provider. Older and higher educated participants more often preferred specialists over regular doctors and pharmacists (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). CONCLUSIONS: Despite receiving contraceptive steroid hormones and care from endocrinologists and family planning specialists in a clinical trial, participants would prefer to obtain contraception from their regular doctor. IMPLICATIONS: As most men expect to obtain hormonal male contraceptives from their regular doctor when commercially available, primary care physicians should become familiar with HMCs and be prepared to provide counseling and options accordingly.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in children. Several scoring systems are used to predict outcome and mortality for pediatric patients with sepsis, but how they compare to each other in terms of sensitivity and specificity is unclear. METHODS: The systematic literature review was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Publically accessible search engines and study databases such as PubMed, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and Google Scholar were scanned for articles published from January 1990 to March 2021 using relevant key words. All relevant studies were analyzed separately by two reviewers. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled sensitivity and pooled specificity with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was evaluated using I RESULTS: Eleven studies met inclusion criteria and evaluated the SOFA scoring system. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and SROC for prediction of mortality were 83% (95% CI: 76%-88%), 72% (95% CI: 60%-81%), and 85% (95% CI: 82%-88%), respectively. Six studies examined the SIRS system. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and SROC were 80% (95% CI: 64%-90%), 36% (95% CI: 23%-51%), and 59% (95% CI: 55%-63%), respectively.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The accumulation of soluble and insoluble aggregated amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) may initiate or potentiate pathologic processes in Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to A\u03b2 soluble protofibrils, is being tested in persons with early Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We conducted an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial involving persons 50 to 90 years of age with early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) with evidence of amyloid on positron-emission tomography (PET) or by cerebrospinal fluid testing. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous lecanemab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline at 18 months in the score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). Key secondary end points were the change in amyloid burden on PET, the score on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90; higher scores indicate greater impairment), the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS; range, 0 to 1.97; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL; range, 0 to 53; lower scores indicate greater impairment). RESULTS: A total of 1795 participants were enrolled, with 898 assigned to receive lecanemab and 897 to receive placebo. The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, -0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.23; P<0.001). In a substudy involving 698 participants, there were greater reductions in brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo (difference, -59.1 centiloids; 95% CI, -62.6 to -55.6). Other mean differences between the two groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14 score, -1.44 (95% CI, -2.27 to -0.61; P<0.001); for the ADCOMS, -0.050 (95% CI, -0.074 to -0.027; P<0.001); and for the ADCS-MCI-ADL score, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001). Lecanemab resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions in 12.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Lecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events. Longer trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease. (Funded by Eisai and Biogen; Clarity AD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03887455.).",

        "abstract": "Most autoimmune diseases occur significantly more frequently in women than men. This female preponderance for abnormal autoimmune function has largely gone unexplained. Many investigations have concentrated on the effects of female and male sex hormones on immune function, by suggesting that estrogens favor the antibody production-enhancing Th2 response and, by doing so, possibly, increase the risk towards abnormal autoimmune function. Others have suggested that women are genetically predisposed towards abnormal autoimmune function, possibly because the X chromosome may confer susceptibility towards tolerance breakdown. Recent developments have, however, opened new research avenues. The possible association between persistent fetal-maternal microchimerism and the development of autoimmune diseases has attracted special interest. Since, in analogy to allogeneic organ transplantation, fetal-maternal (and maternal-fetal) microchimerism may play an important role in the immunologic tolerance of the fetal semi-allograft, female preponderance for autoimmune diseases may be understood as a consequence of increased allogeneic cell traffic in females (in comparison to males), increased risk for long-term microchimerism and, therefore, as a consequence of the former two, the development of abnormal autoimmunity. Under an evolutionary view point the occurrence of autoimmune diseases, in general, can be seen as the price to be paid for successful reproduction. In view of increased exposure to cell traffic, women, of course, would be expected to pay a higher price, reflected in more autoimmunity.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has unfortunately been the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022\u00a0Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. \u2022\u00a0When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended.

        "abstract": "It is estimated that 4-8% of youth in Europe carry out substantial care for a family member or significant other. To prevent adverse psychosocial outcomes in young carers (YCs), primary prevention resilience building interventions have been recommended. We describe the study protocol of an international randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an innovative group intervention designed to promote the mental health and well-being of adolescent YCs (AYCs) aged 15-17. The RCT will be conducted in six European countries in the context of the Horizon 2020 European funded research and innovation project \"Psychosocial support for promoting mental health and well-being among adolescent young caregivers in Europe\" (\"ME-WE\"). The ME-WE intervention is based on Hayes and Ciarrochi's psychoeducational model for adolescents and will consist of seven 2-h sessions in a group format, aimed to help AYCs build psychological flexibility and live according to their values. The control group will be a waitlist. Primary and secondary outcomes and control variables will be measured at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and 3 months follow-up (T2). The COVID-19 pandemic has made amendments necessary to the original study protocol methodology, which we describe in detail. This study will contribute to building an evidence-based manualized program that educators and health and social care professionals can use to support AYCs in their transition to adulthood. From a research perspective, the outcomes of this study will contribute to evidence-based practices in primary prevention of psychosocial difficulties in AYCs and will gather novel knowledge on the effectiveness of Hayes and Ciarrochi's model for use with middle adolescents with caring responsibilities. The trial has been preregistered (registration number: NCT04114864).",

        "abstract": "Vitamin K2 activates vitamin K-dependent proteins that support many biological functions, such as bone mineralization, the inhibition of vascular stiffness, the improvement of endothelial function, the maintenance of strong teeth, brain development, joint health, and optimal body weight. Due to the transformation of food habits in developed countries over the last five decades, vitamin K and, specifically, vitamin K2 intakes among parents and their offspring have decreased significantly, resulting in serious health implications. The therapeutics used in pediatric practice (antibiotics and glucocorticoids) are also to blame for this situation. Low vitamin K status is much more frequent in newborns, due to both endogenous and exogenous insufficiencies. Just after birth vitamin K stores are low, and since human milk is relatively poor in this nutrient, breast-fed infants are at particular risk of a bleeding disorder called vitamin K deficiency bleeding. A pilot study showed that better vitamin K status is associated with lower rate of low-energy fracture incidence. An ongoing clinical trial is intended to address whether vitamin K2 and D3 supplementation might positively impact the biological process of bone healing. Vitamin K2 as menaquinone-7 (MK-7) has a documented history of safe and effective use. The lack of adverse effects of MK-7 makes it the ideal choice for supplementation by pregnant and nursing women and children, both healthy and suffering from various malabsorptions and health disorders, such as dyslipidemia, diabetes, thalassemia major (TM), cystic fibrosis (CF), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), and chronic liver diseases. Additionally, worthy of consideration is the use of vitamin K2 in obesity-related health outcomes.",

In the present study, a deep learning structure for mortality prediction of septic patients was developed and compared with several machine learning methods as well as two sepsis screening tools: the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA). The mortality predictions were explored for septic patients who died within 72 h and 28 days. Results demonstrated that the accuracy rate of deep learning methods, especially Convolutional Neural Network plus SoftMax (87.01% in 72 h and 81.59% in 28 d), exceeds that of the other machine learning methods, SIRS, and qSOFA.

        "abstract": "Human livelihood highly depends on applying different sources of energy whose utilization is associated with air pollution. On the other hand, air pollution may be associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Unlike other environmental causes of cancer (e.g., irradiation), air pollution cannot efficiently be controlled by geographical borders, regulations, and policies. The unavoidable exposure to air pollution can modify cancer incidence and mortality. GBM treatment with chemotherapy or even its surgical removal has proven insufficient (100% recurrence rate; patient's survival mean of 15 months; 90% fatality within five years) due to glioma infiltrative and migratory capacities. Given the barrage of attention and research investments currently plowed into next-generation cancer therapy, oncolytic viruses are perhaps the most vigorously pursued. Provision of an insight into the current state of the research and future direction is essential for stimulating new ideas with the potentials of filling research gaps. This review manuscript aims to overview types of brain cancer, their burden, and different causative agents. It also describes why air pollution is becoming a concerning factor. The different opinions on the association of air pollution with brain cancer are reviewed. It tries to address the significant controversy in this field by hypothesizing the air-pollution-brain-cancer association via inflammation and atopic conditions. The last section of this review deals with the oncolytic viruses, which have been used in, or are still under clinical trials for GBM treatment. Engineered adenoviruses (i.e., DNX-2401, DNX-2440, CRAd8-S-pk7 loaded Neural stem cells), herpes simplex virus type 1 (i.e., HSV-1 C134, HSV-1 rQNestin34.5v.2, HSV-1 G207, HSV-1 M032), measles virus (i.e., MV-CEA), parvovirus (i.e., ParvOryx), poliovirus (i.e., Poliovirus PVSRIPO), reovirus (i.e., pelareorep), moloney murine leukemia virus (i.e., Toca 511 vector), and vaccinia virus (i.e., vaccinia virus TG6002) as possible life-changing alleviations for GBM have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first review that comprehensively discusses both (i) the negative/positive association of air pollution with GBM; and (ii) the application of oncolytic viruses for GBM, including the most recent advances and clinical trials. It is also the first review that addresses the controversies over air pollution and brain cancer association. We believe that the article will significantly appeal to a broad readership of virologists, oncologists, neurologists, environmentalists, and those who work in the field of (bio)energy. Policymakers may also use it to establish better health policies and regulations about air pollution and (bio)fuels exploration, production, and consumption.",

Various treatment methods have been used for the management of CP disorder. However, there has been no absolute cure for this condition. Furthermore, some of the procedures which are currently used for relief of symptoms in CP cause discomfort or side effects in the patient. Recently, stem cell therapy has attracted a huge interest as a new therapeutic method for treatment of CP. Several investigations in animal and human with CP have demonstrated positive potential of stem cell transplantation for the treatment of CP disorder. The ultimate goal of this therapeutic method is to harness the regenerative capacity of the stem cells causing a formation of new tissues to replace the damaged tissue. During the recent years, there have been many investigations on stem cell therapy. However, there are still many unclear issues regarding this method and high effort is needed to create a technology as a perfect treatment. This review will discuss the scientific background of stem cell therapy for cerebral palsy including evidences from current clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7th Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD \u00b1 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged .16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged .15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called 'invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised riskbehaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the \"invisible\" risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.",

The genetic overlap between ALS and other diseases is expanding and includes frontotemporal dementia, Paget's Disease of Bone, myopathy for adult cases, HSP and CMT for young cases highlighing the importance of retrieving the exhaustive familial history for each indivdual with ALS. Incomplete disease penetrance, diversity of the possible phenotypes, as well as the lack of confidence concerning the pathogenicity of most identified variants and/or possible oligogenic inheritance are burdens of ALS genetic counseling to be delivered to patients and at risk individuals.

Since 1993 and the discovery of mutation in the SOD1 gene, number of genes linked to or promoting ALS had always growing. Among them, only four (SOD1, TARDBP, FUS and C9ORF72 genes) are unanimously recognized as convincing causative genetic factors for more than 60% of familial and probably 10% of sporadic ALS cases. Geographic origin of the studied populations tends to become one of the major items in the gene-ALS relationship: this was extremely stressed for C9ORF72. Concerning susceptibility genes factors, an increase of the risk of ALS is clearly shown for SMN1 and ATXN2 genes and accepted for some VEGF haplotypes. Finally, some modulating effects might also exist as underline for the relationships between ApoE and ALS that differ between European and North American studies. In inherited ALS, The European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) edited rules that gave a legal frame to situations for which research of mutations were justified. Progress in the field of genetic raises major questions concerning the relevance of genetic studies from asymptomatic relatives.

        "abstract": "Vitamin K is required for the biological activity of several coagulation factors, which is considered as the classical function of vitamin K. Recent research, however, suggests a role of vitamin K in bone metabolism. The metabolic role of vitamin K is to facilitate the carboxylation of glutamyl to gamma-carboxyglutamyl residues. Besides the hepatic tissue, in which the clotting factors are produced gamma-carboxyglutamyl-containing proteins are also abundantly available in bone tissue. Osteocalcin accounts for up to 80% of the total gamma-carboxyglutamyl content of mature bone. Human carboxylated osteocalcin contains 3 gamma-carboxyglutamyl residues which confer a highly specific affinity to the calcium ion of the hydroxyapatite molecule. Besides the gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin vitamin K may also affect other parameters of bone metabolism, such as calcium hemostasis, and prostaglandin E2 and interleukin 6 production. Evidence from observational studies and first intervention trials indicate that vitamin K intakes much higher than the current recommendations improved biochemical markers of bone formation as well as bone density. In conclusion, the mechanistic data as well as the observational data and the results of the first controlled clinical trials in humans point to a beneficial effect of additional intakes of vitamin K in bone health.",

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has transformed pediatric oncology by producing high remission rates and potent effects in CD19+ B-cell malignancies. This scenario is ideal as CD19 expression is homogeneous and human blood provides a favorable environment for CAR-T cells to thrive and destroy cancer cells (along with normal B cells). Yet, CAR-T cell therapies for solid tumors remain challenged by fewer tumor targets and poor CAR-T cell performances in a hostile tumor microenvironment. For acute myeloid leukemia and childhood solid tumors such as osteosarcoma, the primary treatment is systemic chemotherapy that often falls short of expectation especially for relapsed and refractory conditions. We aim to develop a CAR-T adaptor molecule (CAM)-based therapy that uses a bispecific small-molecule ligand EC17, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated with folic acid, to redirect FITC-specific CAR-T cells against folate receptor (FR)-positive tumors. As previously confirmed in rodents as well as in human clinical studies, EC17 penetrates solid tumors within minutes and is retained due to high affinity for the FR, whereas unbound EC17 rapidly clears from the blood and from receptor-negative tissues. When combined with a rationally designed CAR construct, EC17 CAM was shown to trigger CAR-modified T cell activation and cytolytic activity with a low FR threshold against tumor targets. However, maximal cytolytic potential correlated with (i) functional FR levels (in a semi-log fashion), (ii) the amount of effector cells present, and (iii) tumors' natural sensitivity to T cell mediated killing. In tumor-bearing mice, administration of EC17 CAM was the key to drive CAR-T cell activation, proliferation, and persistence against FR+ pediatric hematologic and solid tumors. In our modeling systems, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was induced under specific conditions, but the risk of severe CRS could be easily mitigated or prevented by applying intermittent dosing and/or dose-titration strategies for the EC17 CAM. Our approach offers the flexibility of antigen control, prevents T cell exhaustion, and provides additional safety mechanisms including rapid reversal of severe CRS with intravenous sodium fluorescein. In this paper, we summarize the translational aspects of our technology in support of clinical development.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pediatric sepsis has a very high morbidity and mortality rate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate diagnostic biomarkers and immune cell infiltration in pediatric sepsis. METHODS: Three datasets (GSE13904, GSE26378, and GSE26440) were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. After identifying overlapping genes in differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and modular sepsis genes selected via a weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) in the GSE26378 dataset, pivotal genes were further identified by using LASSO regression and random forest analysis to construct a diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to validate the efficacy of the diagnostic model for pediatric sepsis. Furthermore, we used qRT-PCR to detect the expression levels of pivotal genes and validate the diagnostic model's ability to diagnose pediatric sepsis in 65 actual clinical samples. RESULTS: Among 294 overlapping genes of DEGs and modular sepsis genes, five pivotal genes (STOM, MS4A4A, CD177, MMP8, and MCEMP1) were screened to construct a diagnostic model of pediatric sepsis. The expression of the five pivotal genes was higher in the sepsis group than in the normal group. The diagnostic model showed good diagnostic ability with AUCs of 1, 0.986, and 0.968. More importantly, the diagnostic model showed good diagnostic ability with AUCs of 0.937 in the 65 clinical samples and showed better efficacy compared to conventional inflammatory indicators such as procalcitonin (PCT), white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and neutrophil percentage (NEU%). CONCLUSION: We developed and tested a five-gene diagnostic model that can reliably identify pediatric sepsis and also suggest prospective candidate genes for peripheral blood diagnostic testing in pediatric sepsis patients.",

        "abstract": "There is a well-known knowledge gap regarding the efficacy and safety of medicines in children of all ages and children are often treated with medicines off-label. Children are thus deprived of treatment based on the same quality of information that guides treatment in adults. The knowledge gap regarding efficacy and safety of medicines in children has been acknowledged by authorities and is reflected in legislation both in North America and in the European Union. Recent reports on the effects of legislation indicates that paediatric clinical trials remain a challenge.Paediatric clinical trials are needed in the entire developmental age spectrum and are especially needed in certain therapy areas. Paediatric clinical trials have special features compared with trials in adults, and these need to be taken into account. These special features include scientific issues related to small samples and heterogeneity, the consent/assent procedure, the need for age-appropriate study information, specific outcomes and safety issues related to development and maturation. Competence in paediatric clinical trials is required in both designing, planning, co-ordinating and organising paediatric clinical trials, as well as research infrastructure and networks to increase power and disseminate information and expert advice. Strengthening of paediatric clinical research is essential to facilitate generating the data that will let children enjoy new medical advances in a similar manner as adults.",

        "abstract": "The study examined whether the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood, Revised Edition (DC: 0-3R; ZERO TO THREE, 2005) Parent-Infant Relationship Global Assessment Scale (PIR-GAS) is applicable to six European countries and contributes to the identification of caregiver-infant/toddler dyads with abusive relationship patterns. The sample consisted of 115 dyads with children's ages ranging from 1 to 47 months. Sixty-four dyads were recruited from community settings without known violence problems, and 51 dyads were recruited from clinical settings and already had been identified with violence problems or as being at risk for violence problems. To classify the dyads on the PIR-GAS categories, caregiver-child interactions were video-recorded and coded with observational scales appropriate for child age. To test whether the PIR-GAS allows for reliable identification of dyads with abusive relationship patterns, PIR-GAS ratings were compared with scores on the the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect's (ISPCAN) Child Abuse Screening Tool-Parental Version (ICAST-P; D.K. Runyan et\u00a0al., ), a questionnaire measuring abusive parental disciplinary practices. It was found that PIR-GAS ratings differentiated between the general and the clinical sample, and the dyads with abusive patterns of relationship were identified by both the PIR-GAS and the ICAST-P. Interrater reliability for the PIR-GAS ranged from moderate to excellent. The value of a broader use of tools such as the DC: 0-3R to promote early identification of families at risk for infant and toddler abuse and neglect is discussed.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Cannabis use has been associated to a wide variety of mental disorders, the possible causal role of this use in the etiology of severe mental disorders as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder standing out. Moreover, the cannabinoid system is involved in emotional regulation, so cannabis use could disturb this process and provoke anxiety and mood disorders. The main objective of this study was to analyze the cannabis addict subgroup from Madrid study of prevalence of dual disorders in community mental health and substance misuse services. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 837 outpatients under treatment in the mental health network or drug network of the Community of Madrid (Spain). Of these, 353 subjects had a lifetime diagnosis of cannabis abuse or dependence and 357 subjects did not have cannabis substance use disorder. We used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to evaluate axis I mental disorders, and Personality Disorder Questionnaire to evaluate personality disorders. RESULTS: It was considered that 76.5% of the cannabis addicts had a current dual disorder. The most prevalent ones were mood and anxiety disorders. Of those addicted to cannabis, 51% had a personality disorder. Most of them had several substance use disorders. Cannabis abuse or dependence subjects had an earlier onset in consumption of other drugs such as alcohol, cocaine, and tobacco than addicts without cannabis abuse or dependence. The cannabis addicts also differed from the other addicts because of an association to antisocial personality disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis and agoraphobia. The presence of these mental disorders was significantly associated to a lower age at initiation of cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS: Dual pathology is very high in cannabis addicts under treatment. Said consumption of cannabis, probably within a polysubstance use pattern, is associated to severe mental disorders as psychosis and bipolar disorder. An earlier age of onset in cannabis use is associated to a greater risk of said mental disorders.",

No significant differences in expression of neurotrophic factors were found between PBMCs and mPBMCs. However, in cerebral palsy children, the expression of interleukin-6 was significantly increased in mPBMCs as compared to PBMCs, and the expression of interleukin-3 was significantly decreased in mPBMCs as compared to PBMCs. In healthy adults, the expression levels of both interleukin-1\u03b2 and interleukin-6 were significantly increased in mPBMCs as compared to PBMCs. The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factors in mPBMC from cerebral palsy children was significantly higher than that in the cord blood or mPBMCs from healthy adults. The expression of G-CSF in mPBMCs from cerebral palsy children was comparable to that in the cord blood but significantly higher than that in mPBMCs from healthy adults. Lower expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-3, and -6) and higher expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-8 and interleukin-9) were observed from the cord blood and mPBMCs from cerebral palsy children rather than from healthy adults. These findings indicate that mPBMCs from cerebral palsy and cord blood mononuclear cells from healthy newborns have the potential to become seed cells for treatment of cerebral palsy.",

Lecanemab is anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease but is only marginally effective. Other antibodies are being developed including solanezumab. AREAS COVERED: A phase 3 clinical trial of solanezumab in preclinical Alzheimer's disease. In the A4 study, solanezumab did not reduce the decline in cognition or function and had no effect on brain amyloid burden. EXPERT OPINION: After the poor results in the EXPEDITION series of trials, the development of solanezumab should have been terminated. The rationale for undertaking the A4 trial was questionable, and the lack of benefit was probable. The controversial approval of two anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies (aducanumab and lecanemab) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), despite a high incidence of amyloid-related imagining abnormalities (ARIA), may be fueling this continuation of clinical development of agents such as solanezumab. The lesson from the A4 trial is that more careful/realistic consideration needs to be given before embarking on further phase 3 trials with anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies.",

Evidence was found for a bidirectional relationship in girls, with depressive symptoms being a risk factor for increased self-harm one year later and self-harm a risk factor for increased depressive symptoms. Cluster analysis of profiles of depressive symptoms led to the identification of two clusters with clear depressive profiles (one severe, the other mild/moderate) which were both characterized by an overrepresentation of girls and elevated levels of self-harm. Clusters with more circumscribed problems were also identified; of these, significantly increased levels of self-harm were found in a cluster characterized by negative self-image and in a cluster characterized by dysphoric relations to parents. It is suggested that self-harm serves more to regulate negative self-related feelings than sadness.",

The condition commonly referred to as \"frozen ankle\" (FA), which Goldman was the first to use, relates to the ankle joint and is challenging to both diagnose and treat. Data acquired from people who suffer from this type of damage in other joints such as the shoulder, hip, and wrist also exists. Despite the fact that a well-defined model for the medical management of FA does not exist, a wide spectrum of local treatments, both surgical and non-surgical, exist. This review gives an overview of the current scientific position of the frozen ankle in terms of evolutionary factors, etiology, the different mechanisms of action involved, current treatment options, and other possible interventions based on recent discoveries of pathophysiological mechanisms. The application of extracorporeal shockwave therapy, stretching exercises, and corticosteroid injections combined with physical therapy modalities that enhance pain management, range of motion, and functional capacity is highly advisable for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis, commonly known as \"frozen joints\". Furthermore, the addition of interventions both impacting and analyzing chronic hypoxia, low-grade inflammation, and sedentary life is proposed.",

The purpose of the present study was to identify candidate genes of preterm infants who are susceptible to RSV infection and provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of RSV infection. METHODS: Three datasets (GSE77087, GSE69606 and GSE41374) containing 183 blood samples of RSV infected patients and 33 blood samples of healthy controls from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were downloaded and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out. The function and pathway enrichments were analyzed through Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for DEGs was constructed through Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). The module analysis was performed by Cytoscape software and hub genes were identified. Clinical verification was employed to verify the expression level of top five hub genes among 72 infants including 50 RSV infected patients and 22 non-RSV-infected patients hospitalized in our center. Further, the RSV infected infants with high-expression IFI27 and those with low-expression IFI27 were compared (defined as higher or lower than the median mRNA level). Finally, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) focusing on IFI27 was carried out. RESULTS: Totally, 4028 DEGs were screened out and among which, 131 most significant DEGs were selected. Subsequently, 13 hub genes were identified, and function and pathway enrichments of hub genes mainly were: response to virus, defense response to virus, regulation of viral genome replication and regulation of viral life cycle. Furthermore, IFI27 was confirmed to be the most significantly expressed in clinical verification. Gene sets associated with calcium signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix receptor interaction and so on were significantly enriched when IFI27 was highly expressed. Moreover, high-expression IFI27 was associated with more severe cases (p\u2009=\u20090.041), more requirements of mechanical ventilation (p\u2009=\u20090.034), more frequent hospitalization (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and longer cumulative hospital stay (p\u2009=\u20090.012). CONCLUSION: IFI27 might serve to predict RSV infection and evaluate the severity of RSV infection in preterm infants.",

Unfortunately, interventions that simultaneously address cannabis use and co-occurring psychiatric disorders are limited in availability. Targeted digital interventions to reduce cannabis use could be beneficial for patients with psychiatric disorders. Digital interventions could be easily disseminated and used in numerous clinical locations, including outpatient, inpatient, residential, and community psychiatric treatment settings. METHODS: Literature on digital cannabis reduction interventions for persons with psychiatric disorders was examined between April 2021 and June 2021. Articles were obtained from PubMed and PsycINFO databases. English language randomized controlled trials (RCT), feasibility and acceptability studies, pilot studies, and published protocols were included. RESULTS: There is significant evidence that digital interventions can effectively reduce cannabis use in general, non-clinical populations. However, there is less literature examining interventions for persons living with co-occurring psychiatric illness-most of which is tailored to patients living with chronic psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is great need for accessible and tailored digital interventions for co-occurring CUD and psychiatric disorders.",

        "abstract": "Depression rates in young people have risen sharply in the past decade, especially in females, which is of concern because adolescence is a period of rapid social, emotional, and cognitive development and key life transitions. Adverse outcomes associated with depression in young people include depression recurrence; the onset of other psychiatric disorders; and wider, protracted impairments in interpersonal, social, educational, and occupational functioning. Thus, prevention and early intervention for depression in young people are priorities. Preventive and early intervention strategies typically target predisposing factors, antecedents, and symptoms of depression. Young people who have a family history of depression, exposure to social stressors (eg, bullying, discordant relationships, or stressful life events), and belong to certain subgroups (eg, having a chronic physical health problem or being a sexual minority) are at especially high risk of depression. Clinical antecedents include depressive symptoms, anxiety, and irritability. Evidence favours indicated prevention and targeted prevention to universal prevention. Emerging school-based and community-based social interventions show some promise. Depression is highly heterogeneous; therefore, a stepwise treatment approach is recommended, starting with brief psychosocial interventions, then a specific psychological therapy, and then an antidepressant medication.",

        "abstract": "Background Public health measures taken to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic can potentially impact the mental health of children. We assessed the prevalence and risk factors for childhood depression during the Covid-19 lockdown. Methods After 100 days of lockdown, we sent a survey questionnaire by WhatsApp to parents of school-aged children (5-16 years) in Chennai. The Short Mood and Feelings questionnaire was used as an objective screening tool to assess depression, with a score of 12 as the cut-off. Results There were 874 responses. The prevalence of childhood depression was 13.7%. Girls were more likely to be depressed than boys; 11-16-year-olds were more likely to be depressed than 5-10-year-old children. Children who had more than 4 hours online education had a higher likelihood of depression. Those who used a cell phone for online classes had a higher likelihood of depression compared to other devices, such as tabs or laptops. Children who slept less than 8 hours a day had a higher likelihood of depression while those who either did not sleep in the afternoon or slept less than 1 hour had a lower likelihood of depression. Children who were interacting with family over 1 hour per day had a lower likelihood of depression. Conclusion Overzealous online education, lack of adequate sleep and failure to spend quality time with the family can negatively impact the mental health of children. The impact of Covid-19 on the emotional health of children should be addressed by public health policy-makers and healthcare professionals.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral contraceptives (OCs) are an essential medicine used by millions of people every day. Given the widespread usage of these medicines, even a small increase in psychiatric risk could be of clinical significance. Although mood-related side effects are a common reason for OC hesitancy and discontinuation, studies investigating psychiatric responses to OC treatment have had inconsistent results. SUMMARY: While OCs are beneficial for most users, there is evidence that a subgroup of users is susceptible to mood side effects. Randomized controlled trials have generally failed to find differences in mood symptoms between OC and placebo users, but observational studies comparing OC users to non-users have reported increases in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. Additionally, observational evidence suggests that OC users may be more likely to use prescription psychotropic medications and to attempt or die by suicide. However, responses to OC treatment are highly heterogeneous, and some users report mood improvement. A variety of factors may increase the likelihood of negative psychiatric side effects, including younger age, previous experience of side effects from OCs, and preexisting psychiatric disorders. Progestin-only pills may confer a higher psychiatric risk than combination pills. KEY MESSAGES: Further research investigating factors that contribute to susceptibility to the mood-related side effects of OCs is clearly warranted. Genomic approaches may provide insight as to why some users experience side effects while others do not. Research elucidating who is most at risk and why will be essential to addressing prevalent concerns about the psychiatric risk of OCs.",

METHOD: We studied 3986 positive blood cultures from children up to 17\u00a0years of age at a paediatric hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, using data from medical records before and after the initiatives, to reduce early onset sepsis, were introduced in 2007 and 2008. RESULTS: Bloodstream infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae declined by 42% overall (5.6 to 3.2/100\u00a0000) and by 62% in previously healthy children under 36\u00a0months of age (24.2 to 9.2/100\u00a0000). Early onset sepsis caused by group B streptococcus declined by 60% (0.5 to 0.2/1000 live born children). Bacterial meningitis caused by these bacteria decreased by 70%. Staphylococcus aureus and various Gram-negative bacteria became the dominant pathogens, in both previously healthy children and those with underlying disease. Overall, antimicrobial resistance remained low between the two 5-year study periods. CONCLUSION: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and risk-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus effectively decreased the incidence of bloodstream infections. Empirical antibiotic therapy should target Staphylococcus aureus in\u00a0both community and hospital-acquired invasive bacterial infections.",

        "abstract": "Most minors and young transgender persons wishing to undergo gender-affirming surgery need to seek specialists affiliated with gender affirmation programs in adult hospitals. Research suggests gender affirmation surgery has been established as an effective and medically indicated treatment for gender dysphoria. Although most data on gender-affirming surgeries are from adult populations, there is growing literature establishing their effectiveness in adolescents and young adults. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the perioperative outcomes for gender-diverse youth to deliver safe and affirming care. The primary objective of this retrospective case series is to examine the perioperative characteristics and outcomes of patients with gender identity disorders (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10-code F64) who underwent chest reconstruction (mastectomy) and genital surgery (phalloplasty, metoidioplasty, and vaginoplasty) in a pediatric academic hospital. The secondary aim is to evaluate the value of a specialized anesthesia team for improving clinical outcomes, interdisciplinary communication, and further advancing the transgender perioperative experience. We identified 204 gender affirmation surgical cases, 177 chests/top surgeries, and 27 genital/bottom surgeries. These findings indicate gender-diverse individuals who underwent life-changing surgery at our institution had a median age of 18 years old, with many patients identifying as transmen. Our data suggests that postoperative pain was significant, but adverse events were minimal. The evolution of a specialty anesthesia team and initiatives (anesthesia management guidelines, scheduling, continuity, and education) necessitate direct care coordination and multidisciplinary planning for gender affirmation surgery in transgender youth.",

        "title": "A randomised controlled trial of plasma filtration in severe paediatric sepsis.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether plasma filtration improves 28-day survival in infants and children with severe sepsis. DESIGN: A multicentre randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care units in teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Forty-eight infants and children with severe sepsis. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive plasma filtration (n = 25) or standard therapy (n = 23) for the treatment of septic shock. The primary outcome measure was 28-day survival. Secondary outcome measures included the number of failed organ systems on Day 7, a requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and the modified Glasgow outcome score (MGOS) at 6 months (where 1 is normal and 6 is dead). RESULTS: The trial was stopped early due to poor recruitment. Patients in the plasma filtration group had higher initial disease severity as measured by serum lactate level, inotrope score and MGOS. Ten (40%) children died in the plasma filtration group and 4 (17%) died in the control group. With intention-to-treat analysis and adjustment for lactate level, ventilation index, inotrope score and MGOS at admission using logistic regression, the odds ratio for death with plasma filtration was 1.20 (95% CI, 0.23-6.20; P = 0.82). The median number of failing organ systems at 7 days was 2 (interquartile range [IQR], 1-4) in the plasma filtration group versus 2 (IQR, 1-3) in the control group. Two children in the plasma filtration group required ECMO for 2.5 and 123 hours, and one child in the control group required ECMO for 45 hours. The median MGOS at 6 months was 4 (IQR, 2-6) in the plasma filtration group and 2 (IQR, 1-4) in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not recruit enough patients to test the hypothesis that addition of plasma filtration to our standard care protocol reduces 28-day mortality in children with severe sepsis. However, mortality in the treatment and control groups was not significantly different after adjustment for severity of illness at the time of randomisation.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mortality from meningococcal disease typically occurs within 24 hrs of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. An early, accurate mortality-risk tool may aid in trial design for novel therapies. We assessed the performance of two generic scores that assign mortality risk within 1 hr of ICU admission: the Preintensive Care Pediatric Risk of Mortality (Pre-ICU PRISM) and Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM). DESIGN: Prospective, observational study over 21 months. SETTING: Two tertiary pediatric ICUs accepting referrals from southeast England. PATIENTS: Patients were 165 consecutive children with meningococcal disease. Ages ranged from 0.1 to 17 yrs (median 2.3 yrs). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PIM demonstrated greater sensibility, with complete data collected in 93% of cases, compared with 35% for the pre-ICU PRISM. Both scores discriminated well. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.00) for PIM and 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.88-0.98) for Pre-ICU PRISM; this did not change when applied to the subgroup of patients with complete data. Both scores calibrated poorly, overestimating mortality in the medium-risk strata (and also in the high-risk stratum in the case of Pre-ICU PRISM). When used as a stratification tool for a hypothetical trial (60% reduction in mortality, 80% power), the scores allowed for a reduction in study size by 50% (PIM) and 43% (pre-ICU PRISM). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-ICU PRISM and PIM both discriminate well but calibrate poorly when applied to a cohort of children with meningococcal sepsis. Both scores provide an effective means of stratification for clinical trial purposes. The main advantage for PIM appears to be ease of data collection.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In this 10th European IVF-monitoring (EIM) report, the results of assisted reproductive techniques from treatments initiated in Europe during 2006 are presented. Data were mainly collected from existing national registers. METHODS: From 32 countries, 998 clinics reported 458 759 treatment cycles including: IVF (117 318), ICSI (232 844), frozen embryo replacement (FER, 86 059), egg donation (ED, 12 685), preimplantation genetic diagnosis/screening (6561), in vitro maturation (247) and frozen oocytes replacements (3498). Overall this represents a 9.7% increase in activity since 2005, which is partly due to an increase in registers (seven more countries with complete coverage). European data on intrauterine insemination using husband/partner's (IUI-H) and donor (IUI-D) semen were reported from 22 countries. A total of 134 261 IUI-H and 24 339 IUI-D cycles were included. RESULTS: In 20 countries, where all clinics reported to the IVF register, a total of 359 110 assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles were performed in a population of 422.5 million, corresponding to 850 cycles per million inhabitants. For IVF, the clinical pregnancy rates per aspiration and per transfer were 29.0 and 32.4%, respectively. For ICSI, the corresponding rates were 29.9 and 33.0%. After IUI-H the delivery rate was 9.2% in women below 40. After IVF and ICSI the distribution of transfer of one, two, three and four or more embryos was 22.1, 57.3, 19.0 and 1.6%, respectively. Compared with 2005, fewer embryos were replaced per transfer, but significant national differences in practice were apparent. The proportion of singleton, twin and triplet deliveries after IVF and ICSI combined was 79.2, 19.9 and 0.9%, respectively. This gives a total multiple delivery rates of 20.8% compared with 21.8% in 2005 and 22.7% in 2004. IUI-H in women below 40 years of age resulted in 10.6% twin and 0.6% triplet pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous years, the reported number of ART cycles in Europe has increased, pregnancy rates have increased marginally, even though fewer embryos were transferred and the multiple delivery rates have declined.",

The purpose of the present study was to identify candidate genes of preterm infants who are susceptible to RSV infection and provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of RSV infection. METHODS: Three datasets (GSE77087, GSE69606 and GSE41374) containing 183 blood samples of RSV infected patients and 33 blood samples of healthy controls from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were downloaded and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out. The function and pathway enrichments were analyzed through Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for DEGs was constructed through Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). The module analysis was performed by Cytoscape software and hub genes were identified. Clinical verification was employed to verify the expression level of top five hub genes among 72 infants including 50 RSV infected patients and 22 non-RSV-infected patients hospitalized in our center. Further, the RSV infected infants with high-expression IFI27 and those with low-expression IFI27 were compared (defined as higher or lower than the median mRNA level). Finally, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) focusing on IFI27 was carried out. RESULTS: Totally, 4028 DEGs were screened out and among which, 131 most significant DEGs were selected. Subsequently, 13 hub genes were identified, and function and pathway enrichments of hub genes mainly were: response to virus, defense response to virus, regulation of viral genome replication and regulation of viral life cycle. Furthermore, IFI27 was confirmed to be the most significantly expressed in clinical verification. Gene sets associated with calcium signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix receptor interaction and so on were significantly enriched when IFI27 was highly expressed. Moreover, high-expression IFI27 was associated with more severe cases (p\u2009=\u20090.041), more requirements of mechanical ventilation (p\u2009=\u20090.034), more frequent hospitalization (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and longer cumulative hospital stay (p\u2009=\u20090.012). CONCLUSION: IFI27 might serve to predict RSV infection and evaluate the severity of RSV infection in preterm infants.",

        "title": "Intimate partner violence and maternal health services utilization: evidence from 36 National Household Surveys.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High rates of maternal mortality and intimate partner violence (IPV) are both major worldwide health challenges. Evidence from single-country samples suggests that IPV may be an important risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services, but there is little large-scale evidence on this association. This paper evaluates whether IPV is a risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services in a large cross-country sample, and also compiles evidence on the relative effects of different forms of IPV. METHODS: We analyze the association between intimate partner violence\u00a0and utilization of maternal health care, using a dataset compiling all Demographic and Health Surveys that report data on intimate partner violence. Using data on 166,685 women observed in 36 countries between 2005 and 2016, we estimate logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between lifetime experience of IPV and utilization of antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery care, and postnatal care. We estimate both unadjusted models and models adjusted for geographic and sociodemographic characteristics that are generally correlated with utilization of maternal health care (including age, education, number of children, wealth status, marital status, and urbanity). RESULTS: Lifetime experience of any IPV is associated with decreased use of maternal health services in a broad sample of births observed in lower and middle-income countries: in particular, the utilization of four or more ANC visits, the number of ANC visits, and the utilization of facility care at birth. This association remains statistically significant even after adjusting for country of residence, subnational region of residence, and additional individual-level covariates; however, there is no statistically significant association between experience of any IPV and postnatal care. The only form of IPV significantly associated with care utilization is physical IPV. CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing physical intimate partner violence show lower levels of utilization of maternal health services in a large sample of developing and middle-income countries. Given that reduced utilization of maternal health services is correlated with maternal and neonatal health outcomes, this pattern suggests that IPV prevention may be an important component of interventions targeting enhanced maternal and neonatal health.",

        "title": "Gender as risk factor for autoimmune diseases.",
        "abstract": "Most autoimmune diseases occur significantly more frequently in women than men. This female preponderance for abnormal autoimmune function has largely gone unexplained. Many investigations have concentrated on the effects of female and male sex hormones on immune function, by suggesting that estrogens favor the antibody production-enhancing Th2 response and, by doing so, possibly, increase the risk towards abnormal autoimmune function. Others have suggested that women are genetically predisposed towards abnormal autoimmune function, possibly because the X chromosome may confer susceptibility towards tolerance breakdown. Recent developments have, however, opened new research avenues. The possible association between persistent fetal-maternal microchimerism and the development of autoimmune diseases has attracted special interest. Since, in analogy to allogeneic organ transplantation, fetal-maternal (and maternal-fetal) microchimerism may play an important role in the immunologic tolerance of the fetal semi-allograft, female preponderance for autoimmune diseases may be understood as a consequence of increased allogeneic cell traffic in females (in comparison to males), increased risk for long-term microchimerism and, therefore, as a consequence of the former two, the development of abnormal autoimmunity. Under an evolutionary view point the occurrence of autoimmune diseases, in general, can be seen as the price to be paid for successful reproduction. In view of increased exposure to cell traffic, women, of course, would be expected to pay a higher price, reflected in more autoimmunity.",

        "abstract": "An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7th Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD \u00b1 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged .16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged .15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called 'invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised riskbehaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the \"invisible\" risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.",

PRIOR STUDIES: Studies of testosterone administered alone or in combination of another gonadotropin suppressive agent such as a progestin or gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog showed decisively that the exogenous hormone administrations are effective in suppressing sperm output with few adverse events that are not anticipated. In contraceptive efficacy studies, testosterone alone or combined with a progestin are as effective in preventing pregnancies as female contraceptive methods. CONCLUSION: Hormone combinations for male contraception are in late-phase clinical trials and hold the promise of being the new, reversible contraception method for men in over half a century.

We also monitored clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance. METHOD: We studied 3986 positive blood cultures from children up to 17\u00a0years of age at a paediatric hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, using data from medical records before and after the initiatives, to reduce early onset sepsis, were introduced in 2007 and 2008. RESULTS: Bloodstream infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae declined by 42% overall (5.6 to 3.2/100\u00a0000) and by 62% in previously healthy children under 36\u00a0months of age (24.2 to 9.2/100\u00a0000). Early onset sepsis caused by group B streptococcus declined by 60% (0.5 to 0.2/1000 live born children). Bacterial meningitis caused by these bacteria decreased by 70%. Staphylococcus aureus and various Gram-negative bacteria became the dominant pathogens, in both previously healthy children and those with underlying disease. Overall, antimicrobial resistance remained low between the two 5-year study periods. CONCLUSION: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and risk-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus effectively decreased the incidence of bloodstream infections. Empirical antibiotic therapy should target Staphylococcus aureus in\u00a0both community and hospital-acquired invasive bacterial infections.",

Screening of four main genes (C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS) identified the causes in 15% of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients (two third of the familial cases and 8% of the sporadic ones) but their respective contribution to ALS phenotype varies according the age of disease onset. The genetic overlap between ALS and other diseases is expanding and includes frontotemporal dementia, Paget's Disease of Bone, myopathy for adult cases, HSP and CMT for young cases highlighing the importance of retrieving the exhaustive familial history for each indivdual with ALS. Incomplete disease penetrance, diversity of the possible phenotypes, as well as the lack of confidence concerning the pathogenicity of most identified variants and/or possible oligogenic inheritance are burdens of ALS genetic counseling to be delivered to patients and at risk individuals.

        "title": "Family Talk versus usual services in improving child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness (PRIMERA-Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parental mental illness is common and can lead to dependent children incurring a high risk of developing mental disorders, physical illness, and impaired educational and occupational outcomes. Family Talk is one of the better known interventions designed to prevent the intergenerational transmission of mental illness. However, its evidence base is small, with few robust independent randomised controlled trials, and no associated process or cost evaluations. The PRIMERA (Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children) research programme involves a mixed method evaluation of Family Talk which is being delivered in mental health settings in Ireland to improve child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness. METHODS: The study comprises a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT), with nested economic and process evaluations, to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness and implementation mechanisms of Family Talk compared to usual services. The study is being conducted in 15 adult and child mental health settings in Ireland. Families with a parent with mental illness, and children aged 5-18\u2009years (n\u2009=\u2009144 families) will be randomised to either the 7-session Family Talk programme (n\u2009=\u200996) or to standard care (n\u2009=\u200948) using a 2:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcomes are child psychosocial functioning and family functioning. Secondary outcomes are as follows: understanding and experience of parental mental illness, parental mental health, child and parental resilience, partner wellbeing and service utilisation. Blind assessments will take place at pre-intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Given the prevalence and burden of intergenerational mental illness, it is imperative that prevention through evidence-based interventions becomes a public health priority. The current study will provide an important contribution to the international evidence base for Family Talk whilst also helping to identify key implementation lessons in the scaling up of Family Talk, and other similar interventions, within routine mental health settings.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether plasma filtration improves 28-day survival in infants and children with severe sepsis. DESIGN: A multicentre randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care units in teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Forty-eight infants and children with severe sepsis. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive plasma filtration (n = 25) or standard therapy (n = 23) for the treatment of septic shock. The primary outcome measure was 28-day survival. Secondary outcome measures included the number of failed organ systems on Day 7, a requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and the modified Glasgow outcome score (MGOS) at 6 months (where 1 is normal and 6 is dead). RESULTS: The trial was stopped early due to poor recruitment. Patients in the plasma filtration group had higher initial disease severity as measured by serum lactate level, inotrope score and MGOS. Ten (40%) children died in the plasma filtration group and 4 (17%) died in the control group. With intention-to-treat analysis and adjustment for lactate level, ventilation index, inotrope score and MGOS at admission using logistic regression, the odds ratio for death with plasma filtration was 1.20 (95% CI, 0.23-6.20; P = 0.82). The median number of failing organ systems at 7 days was 2 (interquartile range [IQR], 1-4) in the plasma filtration group versus 2 (IQR, 1-3) in the control group. Two children in the plasma filtration group required ECMO for 2.5 and 123 hours, and one child in the control group required ECMO for 45 hours. The median MGOS at 6 months was 4 (IQR, 2-6) in the plasma filtration group and 2 (IQR, 1-4) in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not recruit enough patients to test the hypothesis that addition of plasma filtration to our standard care protocol reduces 28-day mortality in children with severe sepsis. However, mortality in the treatment and control groups was not significantly different after adjustment for severity of illness at the time of randomisation.",

        "abstract": "Human livelihood highly depends on applying different sources of energy whose utilization is associated with air pollution. On the other hand, air pollution may be associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Unlike other environmental causes of cancer (e.g., irradiation), air pollution cannot efficiently be controlled by geographical borders, regulations, and policies. The unavoidable exposure to air pollution can modify cancer incidence and mortality. GBM treatment with chemotherapy or even its surgical removal has proven insufficient (100% recurrence rate; patient's survival mean of 15 months; 90% fatality within five years) due to glioma infiltrative and migratory capacities. Given the barrage of attention and research investments currently plowed into next-generation cancer therapy, oncolytic viruses are perhaps the most vigorously pursued. Provision of an insight into the current state of the research and future direction is essential for stimulating new ideas with the potentials of filling research gaps. This review manuscript aims to overview types of brain cancer, their burden, and different causative agents. It also describes why air pollution is becoming a concerning factor. The different opinions on the association of air pollution with brain cancer are reviewed. It tries to address the significant controversy in this field by hypothesizing the air-pollution-brain-cancer association via inflammation and atopic conditions. The last section of this review deals with the oncolytic viruses, which have been used in, or are still under clinical trials for GBM treatment. Engineered adenoviruses (i.e., DNX-2401, DNX-2440, CRAd8-S-pk7 loaded Neural stem cells), herpes simplex virus type 1 (i.e., HSV-1 C134, HSV-1 rQNestin34.5v.2, HSV-1 G207, HSV-1 M032), measles virus (i.e., MV-CEA), parvovirus (i.e., ParvOryx), poliovirus (i.e., Poliovirus PVSRIPO), reovirus (i.e., pelareorep), moloney murine leukemia virus (i.e., Toca 511 vector), and vaccinia virus (i.e., vaccinia virus TG6002) as possible life-changing alleviations for GBM have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first review that comprehensively discusses both (i) the negative/positive association of air pollution with GBM; and (ii) the application of oncolytic viruses for GBM, including the most recent advances and clinical trials. It is also the first review that addresses the controversies over air pollution and brain cancer association. We believe that the article will significantly appeal to a broad readership of virologists, oncologists, neurologists, environmentalists, and those who work in the field of (bio)energy. Policymakers may also use it to establish better health policies and regulations about air pollution and (bio)fuels exploration, production, and consumption.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neuromuscular disease due to injury in the infant's brain. The CP disorder causes many neurologic dysfunctions in the patient. Various treatment methods have been used for the management of CP disorder. However, there has been no absolute cure for this condition. Furthermore, some of the procedures which are currently used for relief of symptoms in CP cause discomfort or side effects in the patient. Recently, stem cell therapy has attracted a huge interest as a new therapeutic method for treatment of CP. Several investigations in animal and human with CP have demonstrated positive potential of stem cell transplantation for the treatment of CP disorder. The ultimate goal of this therapeutic method is to harness the regenerative capacity of the stem cells causing a formation of new tissues to replace the damaged tissue. During the recent years, there have been many investigations on stem cell therapy. However, there are still many unclear issues regarding this method and high effort is needed to create a technology as a perfect treatment.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mounting evidence supports the view that intimate partner violence (IPV) is an important cause of maternal mortality. Some, but not all, prior studies suggest that IPV is associated with increased risks of maternal medical conditions such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy which are leading causes of maternal mortality worldwide. We assessed the relation between IPV and risk of preeclampsia among Peruvian women. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a case-control study at two large hospitals in Lima, Peru. Preeclampsia cases were 339 women with pregnancy-induced hypertension and proteinuria (i.e., preeclampsia). Controls were 337 normotensive women. Information concerning women's exposure to physical and emotional violence during pregnancy was collected during in-person interviews conducted after delivery and while patients were in hospital. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from logistic regression models. RESULTS: The prevalence of IPV was 43.1% among cases and 24.3% among controls. Compared with those reporting never exposure to IPV during pregnancy, women reporting any exposure had a 2.4-fold increased risk of preeclampsia (OR=2.4; 95% CI: 1.7-3.3). The association was strengthened slightly after adjusting for maternal age, parity and pre-pregnancy adiposity (OR=2.7; 95% CI: 1.9-3.9). Emotional abuse in the absence of physical violence was associated with a 3.2-fold (95% CI: 2.1-4.9) increased risk of preeclampsia. Emotional and physical abuse during pregnancy was associated with a 1.9-fold increased risk of preeclampsia (95% CI: 1.1-3.5). CONCLUSIONS: IPV among pregnant women is common and is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia. These data support recent calls for coordinated global health efforts to prevent violence against women.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Male contraception with exogenously administered hormones suppresses both luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone leading to low intratesticular testosterone concentration. This results in reversible suppression of spermatogenesis and marked decrease in sperm output in the ejaculate and preventing pregnancy in the female partner. PRIOR STUDIES: Studies of testosterone administered alone or in combination of another gonadotropin suppressive agent such as a progestin or gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog showed decisively that the exogenous hormone administrations are effective in suppressing sperm output with few adverse events that are not anticipated. In contraceptive efficacy studies, testosterone alone or combined with a progestin are as effective in preventing pregnancies as female contraceptive methods. CONCLUSION: Hormone combinations for male contraception are in late-phase clinical trials and hold the promise of being the new, reversible contraception method for men in over half a century. Lessons learned from the male hormonal contraceptive development pave the way for new targeted approached to regulate male fertility.",

        "title": "Oncolytic viruses as a promising therapeutic strategy against the detrimental health impacts of air pollution: The case of glioblastoma multiforme.",
        "abstract": "Human livelihood highly depends on applying different sources of energy whose utilization is associated with air pollution. On the other hand, air pollution may be associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Unlike other environmental causes of cancer (e.g., irradiation), air pollution cannot efficiently be controlled by geographical borders, regulations, and policies. The unavoidable exposure to air pollution can modify cancer incidence and mortality. GBM treatment with chemotherapy or even its surgical removal has proven insufficient (100% recurrence rate; patient's survival mean of 15 months; 90% fatality within five years) due to glioma infiltrative and migratory capacities. Given the barrage of attention and research investments currently plowed into next-generation cancer therapy, oncolytic viruses are perhaps the most vigorously pursued. Provision of an insight into the current state of the research and future direction is essential for stimulating new ideas with the potentials of filling research gaps. This review manuscript aims to overview types of brain cancer, their burden, and different causative agents. It also describes why air pollution is becoming a concerning factor. The different opinions on the association of air pollution with brain cancer are reviewed. It tries to address the significant controversy in this field by hypothesizing the air-pollution-brain-cancer association via inflammation and atopic conditions. The last section of this review deals with the oncolytic viruses, which have been used in, or are still under clinical trials for GBM treatment. Engineered adenoviruses (i.e., DNX-2401, DNX-2440, CRAd8-S-pk7 loaded Neural stem cells), herpes simplex virus type 1 (i.e., HSV-1 C134, HSV-1 rQNestin34.5v.2, HSV-1 G207, HSV-1 M032), measles virus (i.e., MV-CEA), parvovirus (i.e., ParvOryx), poliovirus (i.e., Poliovirus PVSRIPO), reovirus (i.e., pelareorep), moloney murine leukemia virus (i.e., Toca 511 vector), and vaccinia virus (i.e., vaccinia virus TG6002) as possible life-changing alleviations for GBM have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first review that comprehensively discusses both (i) the negative/positive association of air pollution with GBM; and (ii) the application of oncolytic viruses for GBM, including the most recent advances and clinical trials. It is also the first review that addresses the controversies over air pollution and brain cancer association. We believe that the article will significantly appeal to a broad readership of virologists, oncologists, neurologists, environmentalists, and those who work in the field of (bio)energy. Policymakers may also use it to establish better health policies and regulations about air pollution and (bio)fuels exploration, production, and consumption.",

The purpose of the present study was to identify candidate genes of preterm infants who are susceptible to RSV infection and provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of RSV infection. METHODS: Three datasets (GSE77087, GSE69606 and GSE41374) containing 183 blood samples of RSV infected patients and 33 blood samples of healthy controls from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were downloaded and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out. The function and pathway enrichments were analyzed through Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for DEGs was constructed through Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). The module analysis was performed by Cytoscape software and hub genes were identified. Clinical verification was employed to verify the expression level of top five hub genes among 72 infants including 50 RSV infected patients and 22 non-RSV-infected patients hospitalized in our center. Further, the RSV infected infants with high-expression IFI27 and those with low-expression IFI27 were compared (defined as higher or lower than the median mRNA level). Finally, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) focusing on IFI27 was carried out. RESULTS: Totally, 4028 DEGs were screened out and among which, 131 most significant DEGs were selected. Subsequently, 13 hub genes were identified, and function and pathway enrichments of hub genes mainly were: response to virus, defense response to virus, regulation of viral genome replication and regulation of viral life cycle. Furthermore, IFI27 was confirmed to be the most significantly expressed in clinical verification. Gene sets associated with calcium signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix receptor interaction and so on were significantly enriched when IFI27 was highly expressed. Moreover, high-expression IFI27 was associated with more severe cases (p\u2009=\u20090.041), more requirements of mechanical ventilation (p\u2009=\u20090.034), more frequent hospitalization (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and longer cumulative hospital stay (p\u2009=\u20090.012). CONCLUSION: IFI27 might serve to predict RSV infection and evaluate the severity of RSV infection in preterm infants.",

        "title": "Intimate partner violence and maternal health services utilization: evidence from 36 National Household Surveys.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High rates of maternal mortality and intimate partner violence (IPV) are both major worldwide health challenges. Evidence from single-country samples suggests that IPV may be an important risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services, but there is little large-scale evidence on this association. This paper evaluates whether IPV is a risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services in a large cross-country sample, and also compiles evidence on the relative effects of different forms of IPV. METHODS: We analyze the association between intimate partner violence\u00a0and utilization of maternal health care, using a dataset compiling all Demographic and Health Surveys that report data on intimate partner violence. Using data on 166,685 women observed in 36 countries between 2005 and 2016, we estimate logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between lifetime experience of IPV and utilization of antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery care, and postnatal care. We estimate both unadjusted models and models adjusted for geographic and sociodemographic characteristics that are generally correlated with utilization of maternal health care (including age, education, number of children, wealth status, marital status, and urbanity). RESULTS: Lifetime experience of any IPV is associated with decreased use of maternal health services in a broad sample of births observed in lower and middle-income countries: in particular, the utilization of four or more ANC visits, the number of ANC visits, and the utilization of facility care at birth. This association remains statistically significant even after adjusting for country of residence, subnational region of residence, and additional individual-level covariates; however, there is no statistically significant association between experience of any IPV and postnatal care. The only form of IPV significantly associated with care utilization is physical IPV. CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing physical intimate partner violence show lower levels of utilization of maternal health services in a large sample of developing and middle-income countries. Given that reduced utilization of maternal health services is correlated with maternal and neonatal health outcomes, this pattern suggests that IPV prevention may be an important component of interventions targeting enhanced maternal and neonatal health.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parental mental illness is common and can lead to dependent children incurring a high risk of developing mental disorders, physical illness, and impaired educational and occupational outcomes. Family Talk is one of the better known interventions designed to prevent the intergenerational transmission of mental illness. However, its evidence base is small, with few robust independent randomised controlled trials, and no associated process or cost evaluations. The PRIMERA (Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children) research programme involves a mixed method evaluation of Family Talk which is being delivered in mental health settings in Ireland to improve child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness. METHODS: The study comprises a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT), with nested economic and process evaluations, to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness and implementation mechanisms of Family Talk compared to usual services. The study is being conducted in 15 adult and child mental health settings in Ireland. Families with a parent with mental illness, and children aged 5-18\u2009years (n\u2009=\u2009144 families) will be randomised to either the 7-session Family Talk programme (n\u2009=\u200996) or to standard care (n\u2009=\u200948) using a 2:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcomes are child psychosocial functioning and family functioning. Secondary outcomes are as follows: understanding and experience of parental mental illness, parental mental health, child and parental resilience, partner wellbeing and service utilisation. Blind assessments will take place at pre-intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Given the prevalence and burden of intergenerational mental illness, it is imperative that prevention through evidence-based interventions becomes a public health priority. The current study will provide an important contribution to the international evidence base for Family Talk whilst also helping to identify key implementation lessons in the scaling up of Family Talk, and other similar interventions, within routine mental health settings.

Screening of four main genes (C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS) identified the causes in 15% of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients (two third of the familial cases and 8% of the sporadic ones) but their respective contribution to ALS phenotype varies according the age of disease onset. The genetic overlap between ALS and other diseases is expanding and includes frontotemporal dementia, Paget's Disease of Bone, myopathy for adult cases, HSP and CMT for young cases highlighing the importance of retrieving the exhaustive familial history for each indivdual with ALS. Incomplete disease penetrance, diversity of the possible phenotypes, as well as the lack of confidence concerning the pathogenicity of most identified variants and/or possible oligogenic inheritance are burdens of ALS genetic counseling to be delivered to patients and at risk individuals.

We also monitored clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance. METHOD: We studied 3986 positive blood cultures from children up to 17\u00a0years of age at a paediatric hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, using data from medical records before and after the initiatives, to reduce early onset sepsis, were introduced in 2007 and 2008. RESULTS: Bloodstream infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae declined by 42% overall (5.6 to 3.2/100\u00a0000) and by 62% in previously healthy children under 36\u00a0months of age (24.2 to 9.2/100\u00a0000). Early onset sepsis caused by group B streptococcus declined by 60% (0.5 to 0.2/1000 live born children). Bacterial meningitis caused by these bacteria decreased by 70%. Staphylococcus aureus and various Gram-negative bacteria became the dominant pathogens, in both previously healthy children and those with underlying disease. Overall, antimicrobial resistance remained low between the two 5-year study periods. CONCLUSION: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and risk-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus effectively decreased the incidence of bloodstream infections. Empirical antibiotic therapy should target Staphylococcus aureus in\u00a0both community and hospital-acquired invasive bacterial infections.",

At the same time, there has been an increase in the concentration of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol contained in cannabis. The aims of our study are to measure addictive and psychiatric comorbidities in cannabis users in France, and to compare characteristics between women and men. METHODS: Three hundred and forty-two\u00a0heavy cannabis users seen in a cannabis clinic between 2004 and 2014 were assessed during a 2-h clinical interview (DSM-IV, MINI). RESULTS: 83.2% of users are currently cannabis dependent, 10.6% alcohol dependent, and 2.1% cocaine/crack dependent. 37.8% have a current mood disorder, 47.6% have a current anxiety disorder, and 8.8% are psychotic. Women suffer significantly more often than men from major depressive episodes, dysthymia, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), both current and lifetime.

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cannabis use has been the most commonly used illicit psychoactive substance in India. Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.",

Clinical presentations of these disorders are often indistinguishable, hindering assessment and treatment. Despite substantial research identifying cognitive deficits, eye movement abnormalities and speech impairment associated with primary psychotic disorders, these neuropsychological features have not been explored as targets for diagnostic differentiation in early psychosis. METHODS: Eighteen participants with cannabis-induced psychosis (M RESULTS: Relative to individuals with primary psychosis, individuals with cannabis-induced psychosis demonstrated significantly better performance on the pro-saccade task, faster RT on pro- and anti-saccade tasks, better premorbid adjustment, and a higher degree of insight into their illness. There were no significant differences between groups on psychiatric symptoms, premorbid intellectual functioning, or problems related to cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS: In early stages of illness, reliance on traditional diagnostic tools or clinical interviews may be insufficient to distinguish between cannabis-induced and primary psychosis. Future research should continue to explore neuropsychological differences between these diagnoses to improve diagnostic accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Fatigue is a highly prevalent and debilitating symptom in multiple sclerosis, but currently the available treatment options have limited efficacy. The development of innovative and efficacious targeted treatments for fatigue in multiple sclerosis has been marred by the limited knowledge of the underlying mechanisms. One of the hypotheses postulates that multiple sclerosis pathology might cause reduced monoaminergic release in the central nervous system with consequences on motivation, mood and attention. Here, we applied the recently developed Receptor-Enriched Analysis of Functional Connectivity by Targets method to investigate whether patients with high and low fatigue differ in the functional connectivity (FC) of the monoamine circuits in the brain. We recruited 55 patients with multiple sclerosis, which were then classified as highly fatigued or mildly fatigued based on their scores on the cognitive sub-scale of the Modified Fatigue Impact scale. We acquired resting-state functional MRI scans and derived individual maps of connectivity associated with the distribution of the dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin transporters as measured by positron emission tomography. We found that patients with high fatigue present decreased noradrenaline transporter (NAT)-enriched connectivity in several frontal and prefrontal areas when compared to those with lower fatigue. The NAT-enriched FC predicted negatively individual cognitive fatigue scores. Our findings support the idea that alterations in the catecholaminergic functional circuits underlie fatigue in multiple sclerosis and identify the NAT as a putative therapeutic target directed to pathophysiology.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recreational cannabis use and alcohol binge drinking are the most common drug consumption patterns in young adults. Impulsivity and several psychopathological signs are increased in chronic drug users, but the implications of recreational use are still poorly understood. METHODS: We evaluated impulsivity, sensation-seeking traits, impulsive decision-making, inhibitory control and possible symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychosis in three groups of young university adults: recreational cannabis users (N=20), alcohol binge drinkers (N=22) and non-drug users (N=26). RESULTS: The cannabis and binge drinking groups had increased scores for impulsivity and sensation-seeking traits. Both groups also exhibited increased impulsive decision-making on the two-choice task and the Iowa gambling task; however, only the cannabis group was significantly different from the non-drug group regarding inhibitory control (go/no-go and stop tasks). The cannabis and binge drinking groups did not show differences in the psychopathological symptoms evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations of this population of non-dependent drug users are consistent with the increased impulsivity traits and behaviors that have been described previously in chronic drug abusers. In this study, compared to no drug use, the recreational use of cannabis was associated with a major dysfunction of the different facets of impulsive behaviors. However, alcohol binge drinking was related only to impulsive decision-making. These results suggest that impulsivity traits and behaviors are present not only in chronic drug abusers but also in recreational drug users. Future work should continue to investigate the long-term effects of these common consumption patterns on various impulsive behaviors and psychopathological symptoms.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity and hunger are significant problems in Canada, with millions of Canadians experiencing some level of food insecurity. The purpose of the present article is to review what is currently known about the effects of food insecurity and hunger on children. Longitudinal studies in Canada indicate that hunger is related to poor health outcomes, including a higher risk of depression and suicidal ideation in adolescents, and chronic conditions, particularly asthma. In addition, nutrient deficiencies, such as iron deficiency, are known to impair learning and cause decreased productivity in school-age children, and maternal depressive disorders. School-based nutrition programs and innovations, such as subsidized food (apples, cheese, soy nuts, carrots and broccoli), are an essential immediate need, but long-term solutions lie in adequate incomes for families.

However, these variables tend to be correlated, and few studies have examined them simultaneously. A national sample of randomly selected psychologists and psychiatrists described 524 adult patients with personality disorders. Family environment, parental psychopathology, and history of abuse all independently predicted BPD symptoms in multiple regression analyses. Sexual abuse contributed to the prediction of BPD symptoms over and above family environment, although family environmental factors such as instability partially mediated the effect.

Unfortunately, interventions that simultaneously address cannabis use and co-occurring psychiatric disorders are limited in availability. Targeted digital interventions to reduce cannabis use could be beneficial for patients with psychiatric disorders. Digital interventions could be easily disseminated and used in numerous clinical locations, including outpatient, inpatient, residential, and community psychiatric treatment settings. METHODS: Literature on digital cannabis reduction interventions for persons with psychiatric disorders was examined between April 2021 and June 2021. Articles were obtained from PubMed and PsycINFO databases. English language randomized controlled trials (RCT), feasibility and acceptability studies, pilot studies, and published protocols were included. RESULTS: There is significant evidence that digital interventions can effectively reduce cannabis use in general, non-clinical populations. However, there is less literature examining interventions for persons living with co-occurring psychiatric illness-most of which is tailored to patients living with chronic psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is great need for accessible and tailored digital interventions for co-occurring CUD and psychiatric disorders.",

METHODS: Information letters were sent to all potential participants (n\u2009=\u200927) in the previous study. Semi-structured interviews (21-57 min) were carried out with all subjects who volunteered (n\u2009=\u200915), administered by an experienced interviewer who was not involved in the previous study. Transcribed interviews were subject to content analysis. RESULTS: The 5 categories that emerged from the content analysis were \"New method gives hope\", experiences related to \"Using the assistive technology\", \"Outcome from training with the assistive technology\", \"The assistive technology\" and \"Taking part in the study\". Respondents felt hopeful when included in the previous study, motivated when experiencing a treatment effect, and disappointed when not. CONCLUSION: The qualitative approach used in this study elicited complementary information that was not evident from the previous randomized controlled trial.

        "abstract": "An influential cannabis lobby and its allies are engaged in an aggressive initiative to mandate health and worker's compensation insurance coverage for non-standardized, non-FDA-regulated cannabis products. If successful, mandated reimbursement would present a severe public health risk and force taxpayers to fund a risky and under-regulated industry. Leaders in psychiatry and other medical specialties have sounded the alarm about the marketing and sale of cannabis products for medical uses without prior review by the FDA. We echo their strong opposition to bills requiring workers' compensation carriers and health insurance plans to cover the cost of dispensary-purchased \"medical\" cannabis. Mandated insurance reimbursement of dispensary products is \"a recipe for a public health disaster, as lowering or eliminating out-of-pocket costs will encourage more consumers to become certified under a state's medical cannabis program, and result in more frequent use of higher-potency cannabinoids (e.g., THC and CBD) that are associated with serious adverse events.\" Until there are thorough studies into these products, including adverse events, side effects and long-term concerns, these products should ",

The former because it affects learning and the latter because it interferes with proper handling of motor vehicles. The most frequently observed complication of cannabis inebriation, however, is a short-lasting acute psychological disturbance with symptoms of panic, paranoid apprehension and personality disorganization. This type of reaction is often not dose-related, and could appropriately be termed \"pathological intoxication\". In addition to the acute effects of cannabis on mental performance and behaviour, this paper reviews the psychiatric consequences of chronic use and the accumulated evidence on organic toxicity associated with it: residual cognitive deficit, lethargic symptoms, cannabis psychosis, respiratory, gastro-intestinal and cardiovascular complications, as well as effects on immune response and gonadal functions, are discussed.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: To determine if a set of time-varying biological indicators can be used to: 1) predict the sepsis mortality risk over time and 2) generate mortality risk profiles. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Nine Canadian ICUs. SUBJECTS: Three-hundred fifty-six septic patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical data and plasma levels of biomarkers were collected longitudinally. We used a complementary log-log model to account for the daily mortality risk of each patient until death in ICU/hospital, discharge, or 28 days after admission. The model, which is a versatile version of the Cox model for gaining longitudinal insights, created a composite indicator (the daily hazard of dying) from the \"day 1\" and \"change\" variables of six time-varying biological indicators (cell-free DNA, protein C, platelet count, creatinine, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and lactate) and a set of contextual variables (age, presence of chronic lung disease or previous brain injury, and duration of stay), achieving a high predictive power (conventional area under the curve, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94). Including change variables avoided misleading inferences about the effects of day 1 variables, signifying the importance of the longitudinal approach. We then generated mortality risk profiles that highlight the relative contributions among the time-varying biological indicators to overall mortality risk. The tool was validated in 28 nonseptic patients from the same ICUs who became septic later and was subject to 10-fold cross-validation, achieving similarly high area under the curve. CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel version of the Cox model, we created a prognostic tool for septic patients that yields not only a predicted probability of dying but also a mortality risk profile that reveals how six time-varying biological indicators differentially and longitudinally account for the patient's overall daily mortality risk.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mental health disorders in children and young people (CYP) are increasing but the provision of current evidence-based treatment for common mental health problems is limited. Treatment effects vary widely with no clear superiority of a single treatment approach. Further evaluation of contemporary and effective treatments in CYP is needed. Metacognitive therapy (MCT) has shown enhanced efficacy over 'gold standard' approaches in adult mental health, but so far has not been evaluated in a randomised trial of CYP. As such, we aim to assess the acceptability and feasibility of group-MCT for CYP with common mental health problems in comparison to usual treatment within Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). METHOD: YoMeta is a multicentre, two-arm, single-blind randomised feasibility trial comparing group-MCT to usual care in CYP with common mental health problems in CAMHS. CYP (target sample n = 100) with a common mental health problem will be recruited across at least three CAMHS services in the UK. Participants in the intervention arm will receive up to eight sessions of group-MCT delivered by a CAMHS mental health practitioner. The control arm will receive usual care in CAMHS which includes individual or group-based therapy. Feasibility will be assessed by the success of recruitment, retention, and data quality. Acceptability of the intervention will be assessed by the number of sessions attended and through qualitative interviews aimed at exploring CYP acceptability and understanding of the intervention. Symptoms of psychological distress will be assessed using the Revised Children Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) at 20 weeks. We will also assess psychological well-being, symptoms of depression, metacognitive beliefs, quality of life, and measures to support economic evaluation (health status and health and social care use). Qualitative interviews will be conducted to understand practitioner's views on training and delivery of group-MCT. DISCUSSION: The trial is designed to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of group-MCT for CYP with common mental health problems. Group-MCT may aid in improving access to treatment, reduce waiting times, and improve outcomes for CYP with common mental health disorders. The study will provide important information and data to evaluate future research potential and confirm sample size estimation for a definitive large-scale RCT to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group-MCT in CYP.

This study investigated the relationship between intimate partner violence, severe acute maternal morbidity in the intensive care unit (ICU), and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study in a hospital in Lima, Peru, with 109 cases (maternal ICU admissions) and 109 controls (obstetric patients not admitted to the ICU). Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and medical record review. Partner violence was assessed using the World Health Organization instrument. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the association between intimate partner violence and severe acute maternal morbidity. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher rate of intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy among cases (58.7%) than controls (27.5%). In multivariate analysis, intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy (aOR 3.83 (95% CI: 1.99-7.37)), being married (3.86 (1.27-11.73)), having <8 antenatal care visits (2.78 (1.14-6.80)), and having previous abortions (miscarriage, therapeutic, or unsafe) (1.69 (1.13-2.51)) were significantly associated with severe acute maternal morbidity. The ICU admission rate was 18.8 (per 1000 live births), and ICU maternal mortality was 1.7%. The perinatal mortality rate was higher in cases (9.3%) than in controls (1.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Intimate partner violence was associated with an increased risk of severe acute maternal morbidity. This suggests a more severe impact of intimate partner violence on pregnancy than has been previously identified.

Since this law took effect, increased availability and use of cannabis in Michigan have led to increased emergency department (ED) visits associated with the drug's psychiatric effects. OBJECTIVES: To describe cannabis-induced anxiety disorder's prevalence, clinical features, and disposition in a community-based study. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive patients diagnosed with acute toxicity related to cannabis use (ICD-10 code F12). Patients were seen at seven EDs over a 24-month study period. Data collected included demographics, clinical features, and treatment outcomes in ED patients who met the criteria for cannabis-induced anxiety disorder. This group was compared to a cohort experiencing other forms of acute cannabis toxicity. Chi-squared and t-tests were used to compare these two groups across key demographic and outcome variables. RESULTS: During the study period, 1135 patients were evaluated for acute cannabis toxicity. A total of 196 patients (17.3%) had a chief complaint of anxiety, and 939 (82.7%) experienced other forms of acute cannabis toxicity, predominantly symptoms of intoxication or cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. Patients with anxiety symptoms had panic attacks (11.7%), aggression or manic behavior (9.2%), and hallucinations (6.1%). Compared to patients presenting with other forms of cannabis toxicity, those with anxiety were likelier to be younger, ingested edible cannabis, had psychiatric comorbidities, or had a history of polysubstance abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis-induced anxiety occurred in 17.3% of ED patients in this community-based study.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many cancer survivors experience fatigue as a nagging symptom lasting years after treatment. To learn of the relevant biological pathways involved in fatigue among cancer survivors, the authors tested for an association between fatigue levels and leukocyte gene expression profiles and determined the specific mediating immune cell types. METHODS: A sample of 89 Hispanic/Latino adults aged 60.5 years, 62% of whom were male, who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer and were 2.9 years since diagnosis provided blood for transcriptome profiling and completed a validated measure of fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form). The authors applied genome-wide transcriptional profiling of leukocyte RNA to identify gene expression activity associated with fatigue, tested for the activity of specific transcription factors involved in previously established markers of inflammation and immunologic activation, and identified the specific cell types mediating these transcriptional alterations. RESULTS: In analyses adjusting for demographic and behavioral health risk factors, results linked fatigue with increased activation of B lymphocytes and CD8-positive T cells, as well as several transcription factors involved in immune activation (nuclear factor \u03baB [NF-\u03baB], signal transducer and activator of transcription [STAT], and cAMP responsive element-binding protein [CREB]). Results also replicated several specific genomic effects previously observed in fatigued cancer survivors, including upregulated expression of \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA) and hemoglobin subunits (HBA and HBB). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors' heightened fatigue levels may be partially explained by activation of specific immune cell subsets, thereby providing a potential molecular biomarker for clinical interventions targeting the remediation of fatigue.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Data on the burden and etiology of neonatal early-onset bacterial sepsis (EOBS) in low-to-middle-income countries are scarce. Surveillance is critical for optimizing prevention and treatment strategies. We aimed to estimate the incidence of EOBS in 2 large Brazilian cohorts of neonates. METHODS: Data were retrospectively obtained from 33,794 neonates born between 2009 and 2017 at low-risk (n = 17,981) and high-risk maternity centers (n = 15,813). Blood cultures were taken within 72 hours of life from neonates with perinatal risk factors for EOBS or suspected EOBS. A positive blood culture for a pathogenic microorganism and a compatible clinical evolution confirmed the diagnosis of EOBS. RESULTS: One-third of the infants born from high-risk and 18.5% from low-risk maternities were investigated for EOBS. Overall, EOBS was more incident in neonates born in the high-risk facilities [66 cases or 4.2/1000 (95% CI: 3.2-5.3)] than in the low-risk facilities [24 cases or 1.3/1000 (95% CI: 0.9-2.0)]. The incidence rate of EOBS increased with decreasing gestational age (<32 weeks: 20.5/1000; 32-36 weeks: 5.6/1000; \u226537 weeks: 1.5/1000). Group B Streptococcus (GBS) was the agent more frequently identified in high-risk and low-risk maternities: 1.8/1000 (95% CI: 1.1-2.4) and 0.4/1000 (95% CI: 0.2-0.9), respectively. EOBS's overall case fatality rate was 17.8% for all the agents and 22% for GBS. CONCLUSIONS: EOBS remains unacceptably high and is frequently fatal in preterm and term infants cared for in high- or low-risk maternities. Because GBS has emerged as the most frequent causative agent, preventive strategies are urgently needed.",

Underlying mechanisms postulated so far have involved localization of brain lesions and abnormalities of the neuroendocrine system and cytokine regulation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between fatigue and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in patients with MS. DESIGN: A prospective survey. SETTING: Outpatient and inpatient study at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Munich, Germany. PATIENTS: Thirty-one patients with clinically definite MS, a relapsing-remitting disease course, and without MS-specific treatment. INTERVENTIONS: Assessment of fatigue with 3 questionnaires: the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), and the Visual Analog Scale. Assessment of HPA axis regulation with the combined dexamethasone-corticotropin releasing hormone (Dex-CRH) test. RESULTS: The FSS score was significantly correlated with the MFIS score. Patients with fatigue had significantly elevated adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) levels in the combined Dex-CRH test. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to results for chronic fatigue syndrome, where a hyporeactivity of the HPA axis has been shown, MS patients with fatigue exhibited a higher activity of the HPA axis than those without fatigue, as evidenced by significantly increased ACTH concentrations. Proinflammatory cytokines, known to be elevated in patients with MS, may cause both HPA axis alterations and fatigue.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of childhood mortality. Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy is an effective treatment for spasticity and dystonia in children with cerebral palsy (CP). However, ITB pump surgery is associated with one of the highest rates of surgical site infection (SSI) in medicine, leading to significant morbidity and expense. Surgical protocols have reduced the rate of SSI in children with other CNS implants, and single-center protocols have been effective in ITB surgery in pediatrics. The authors describe the first multicenter quality improvement (QI)-driven standardized protocol for ITB pump surgery in children with CP across the Cerebral Palsy Research Network (CPRN), implemented with the aim of reducing ITB-associated SSI. METHODS: SSI was defined as a culture-positive infection, ITB pump system removal for suspected infection, or wound dehiscence with exposed hardware. Each center reported historical infection rates for at least 3 years before initiating the SSI protocol (preintervention phase). After initiation of a 13-step surgical protocol, a consecutive series of 130 patients undergoing 149 surgical procedures for ITB at four CPRN tertiary pediatric neurosurgery centers were prospectively enrolled at surgery during a 2-year study period (intervention phase). QI methodology was used, including development of a key driver diagram and tracking performance using run and control charts. The primary process measure goal was documented compliance with 80% of the protocol steps, and the primary outcome measure goal was a 20% reduction in 90-day infection rate. Patient characteristics were collected from the CPRN Research Electronic Data Capture registry, including age at surgery, BMI, Gross Motor Function Classification System level, and pattern of spasticity. RESULTS: The aggregated preintervention 90-day ITB SSI rate was 4.9% (223 procedures) between 2014 and 2017. During the intervention phase, 136 of 149 ITB surgeries performed met inclusion criteria for analysis. The mean documented compliance rate with protocol steps was 75%, and the 90-day infection rate was 4.4%, with an average of 42 days from index surgery to infection. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first multicenter QI initiative designed to reduce SSI in ITB surgery in children with CP. Ongoing enrollment and expansion of the protocol to other CPRN centers will facilitate identification of patient- and procedure-specific risk factors for SSI, and iterative plan-do-study-act cycles incorporating these data will further decrease the risk of SSI for ITB surgery in children.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Iron content is increased in the substantia nigra of persons with Parkinson's disease and may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disorder. Early research suggests that the iron chelator deferiprone can reduce nigrostriatal iron content in persons with Parkinson's disease, but its effects on disease progression are unclear. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, phase 2, randomized, double-blind trial involving participants with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease who had never received levodopa. Participants were assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive oral deferiprone at a dose of 15 mg per kilogram of body weight twice daily or matched placebo for 36 weeks. Dopaminergic therapy was withheld unless deemed necessary for symptom control. The primary outcome was the change in the total score on the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS; range, 0 to 260, with higher scores indicating more severe impairment) at 36 weeks. Secondary and exploratory clinical outcomes at up to 40 weeks included measures of motor and nonmotor disability. Brain iron content measured with the use of magnetic resonance imaging was also an exploratory outcome. RESULTS: A total of 372 participants were enrolled; 186 were assigned to receive deferiprone and 186 to receive placebo. Progression of symptoms led to the initiation of dopaminergic therapy in 22.0% of the participants in the deferiprone group and 2.7% of those in the placebo group. The mean MDS-UPDRS total score at baseline was 34.3 in the deferiprone group and 33.2 in the placebo group and increased (worsened) by 15.6 points and 6.3 points, respectively (difference, 9.3 points; 95% confidence interval, 6.3 to 12.2; P<0.001). Nigrostriatal iron content decreased more in the deferiprone group than in the placebo group. The main serious adverse events with deferiprone were agranulocytosis in 2 participants and neutropenia in 3 participants. CONCLUSIONS: In participants with early Parkinson's disease who had never received levodopa and in whom treatment with dopaminergic medications was not planned, deferiprone was associated with worse scores in measures of parkinsonism than those with placebo over a period of 36 weeks.

Condoms have a relatively high failure rate, at least partially due to compliance problems and are not accepted by many couples. The only other male-oriented methods in clinical trials utilize the administration of testosterone alone or its combination with another gonadotropin-suppressing agent such as a progestin or a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist. Studies published in the 1990s demonstrated that a testosterone-containing hormonal contraceptive method suppressed spermatogenesis to azoospermia in most men and severe oligozoospermia in the remaining. The contraceptive efficacy after treatment with testosterone alone was comparable to that of female hormonal methods. Having proven that reversible male contraception is a reality, present trials are attempting to identify the best androgen delivery system and the most effective androgen plus progestin preparation. It is likely that the first marketed male hormonal contraceptive method will be a long-acting (injectable or implant) combination of an androgen plus a progestin.

In order to improve the outcomes, it is important to know the aetiology and peculiarities of sepsis in a particular region and hospital. The aim of this study was to analyse the outcomes of sepsis in a paediatric intensive care unit and their relation with patients' characteristics and causative microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Sepsis Registration System in Vilnius University Children's hospital was started in 2012. From 2012 to 2015, we found 529 sepsis cases in our hospital, 203 of which were found to be fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria (patient's age >28 days on admission, taken blood culture/positive PCR test, need for paediatric ICU hospitalization) and were included in the final analysis. Abbreviations: ICD - international disease classification PCR - polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Sepsis made 4% of all patients of the paediatric ICU in the period from 2012 to 2015 and caused 32% of deaths in the unit.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors. METHODS AND DESIGN: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes. DISCUSSION: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Better risk assessment tools are needed to predict post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM). Using analytic morphomic measurements from computed tomography (CT) scans, we aimed to identify specific measures of body composition associated with PTDM. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 99 non-diabetic kidney transplant recipients who received pre-transplant CT scans at a single institution between 1/2005 and 5/2014. Analytic morphomic techniques were used to measure abdominal adiposity, abdominal size, and psoas muscle area and density, standardized by gender. We measured the associations of these morphomic factors with PTDM. RESULTS: One-year incidence of PTDM was 18%. The morphomic factors significantly associated with PTDM included visceral fat area (OR=1.84 per standard deviation increase, P=.020), body depth (OR=1.79, P=.035), and total body area (OR=1.67, P=.049). Clinical factors significantly associated with PTDM included African American race (OR=3.01, P=.044), hypertension (OR=2.97, P=.041), and dialysis vintage (OR=1.24 per year on dialysis, P=.048). Body mass index was not associated with PTDM (OR=1.05, P=.188). On multivariate modeling, visceral fat area was an independent predictor of PTDM (OR=1.91, P=.035). CONCLUSIONS: Analytic morphomics can identify pre-transplant measurements of body composition that are predictive of PTDM in kidney transplant recipients. Pre-transplant imaging contains a wealth of underutilized data that may inform PTDM prevention strategies.",

        "abstract": "Trofinetide is a first-in-class pharmacological treatment proposed for patients with Rett Syndrome. It is a long half-life derivative of glycine-proline-glutamate, the tripeptide normally excided from Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 upon degradation. Due to containing glutamate and glycine in its structure, trofinetide is thought to act through NMDA receptor modulation, thus providing a normalization of neuronal activity and survival. Trofinetide was tested in a series of short and long-term trials, showing good efficacy at improving scores on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale and Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire, with specific effect only on some subscales, ie General Mood subscale and Repetitive Face Movement subscale. No effects were documented on other subscales or on epilepsy, heart and bone -related symptoms. The main adverse effects of trofinetide, severe enough to determine discontinuation, include diarrhea, vomiting, and consequent weight loss. These may be scarcely avoidable, given the need to assume a very large amount of trofinetide per day. Other inherent limitations of use possibly regard the limited duration of drug supplies, as one bottle may last three days only, depending on weight, and the relatively high cost per bottle. Trofinetide has no direct competitors: single symptoms of the Rett Syndrome, for instance, seizures or aggressive behaviors, are currently treated with drugs that have been developed for patients without the Rett Syndrome. This leads to suboptimal efficacy and increased risk of adverse effects. The place in therapy of trofinetide is yet to be determined, based on the results of clinical trials, on its practical usability, and on the windows of opportunity for intervention. Moreover, trofinetide may be curative if given early enough during brain development, or merely symptomatic if given to young adults, and no data exist on this aspect. The place in therapy of trofinetide will require reassessment after competing treatments enter the market.",

Vascular calcification (VC) is one of the most important mechanisms of renal pathology. The most potent inhibitor of this process-matrix Gla protein (MGP) is VK-dependent. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, both non-dialysed and hemodialysed, often have VK deficiency. Elevated uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (ucMGP) levels indirectly reflected VK deficiency and are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events in these patients. It has been suggested that VK intake may reduce the VC and related cardiovascular risk. Vitamin K intake has been suggested to reduce VC and the associated cardiovascular risk.

TMEM proteins carry out a wide variety of functions necessary to maintain cell homeostasis TMEM165 participates in glycosylation protein, TMEM88 in the development of cardiomyocytes, TMEM45A in epidermal keratinization, and TMEM74 regulating autophagy. However, for many TMEM proteins, their physiological function remains unknown. The role of these proteins is being recently investigated in cancer since transcriptomic and proteomic studies have revealed that exits differential expression of TMEM proteins in different neoplasms concerning cancer-free tissues. Among the cellular processes in which TMEM proteins have been involved in cancer are the promotion or suppression of cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, migration, intravasation/extravasation, metastasis, modulation of the immune response, and response to antineoplastic drugs. Inclusive data suggests that the participation of TMEM proteins in these cellular events could be carried out through involvement in different cell signaling pathways. However, the exact mechanisms not clear. This review shows a description of the involvement of TMEM proteins that promote or decrease cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in cancer cells, describes those TMEM proteins for which both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter role have been identified, depending on the type of cancer in which the protein is expressed. As well as some TMEM proteins involved in chemoresistance. A better characterization of these proteins is required to improve the understanding of the tumors in which their expression and function are altered; in addition to improving the understanding of the role of these proteins in cancer will show those TMEM proteins be potential candidates as biomarkers of response to chemotherapy or prognostic biomarkers or as potential therapeutic targets in cancer.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sensitive, reliable, and scalable biomarkers are needed to accelerate the development of therapies for Parkinson disease (PD). In this study, we evaluate the biomarkers of early PD diagnosis, disease progression, and treatment effect collected in the SPARK. METHODS: Cinpanemab is a human-derived monoclonal antibody binding preferentially to aggregated forms of extracellular \u03b1-synuclein. SPARK was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 multicenter trial evaluating 3 cinpanemab doses administered intravenously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks with an active treatment dose-blind extension period for up to 112 weeks. SPARK enrolled 357 participants diagnosed with PD within 3 years, aged 40-80 years, \u22642.5 on the modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, and with evidence of striatal dopaminergic deficit. The primary outcome was change from baseline in the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale total score. Secondary and exploratory biomarker outcomes evaluated change from baseline at week 52 relative to placebo. Dopamine transporter SPECT and MRI were used to quantify changes in the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and regional atrophy. CSF and plasma samples were used to assess change in total \u03b1-synuclein levels, \u03b1-synuclein seeding, and neurofilament light chain levels. SPARK was conducted from January 2018 to April 2021 and terminated due to lack of efficacy. RESULTS: Approximately 3.8% (15/398) of SPECT-imaged participants did not have evidence of dopaminergic deficit and were screen-failed. Binary classification of \u03b1-synuclein seeding designated 93% (110/118) of the enrolled CSF subgroup as positive for \u03b1-synuclein seeds at baseline. Clinical disease progression was observed, with no statistically significant difference in cinpanemab groups compared with that in placebo. Ninety-nine percent of participants with positive \u03b1-synuclein seeding remained positive through week 52. No statistically significant changes from baseline were observed between treatment groups and placebo across biomarker measures. Broadly, there was minimal annual change with high interindividual variability across biomarkers-with striatal binding ratios of the ipsilateral putamen showing the greatest mean change/SD over time. DISCUSSION: Biomarker results indicated enrollment of the intended population with early PD, but there was no significant correlation with disease progression or clear evidence of a cinpanemab treatment effect on biomarker measures. Suitable biomarkers for evaluating disease severity and progression in early PD trials are still needed.

While fecal microbiota transplant has gained increasing popularity over the past 50 years for the treatment of refractory Clostridium difficile infections (RCDIs) in adults, it has only been recently utilized in children. The purpose of this article is to review the use of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in the treatment of pediatric RCDIs. RECENT FINDINGS: Minimal pediatric data, including few case reports and series, document the successful use of FMT for treatment of RCDI in the past 2 years. Patients in these reports included otherwise healthy children, those with inflammatory bowel disease as well as significantly immunocompromised children. Donor fecal infusion via nasogastric tube, gastroscope or colonoscope in children aged 16 months and older demonstrated a high rate of symptom resolution and organism eradication. No complications to date have been reported in children who have undergone FMT. SUMMARY: FMT is emerging as a well-tolerated and effective treatment for RCDI in not only adults but also children.",

BACKGROUND: Being the most common cause of children's death, sepsis is a challenge for most physicians. In order to improve the outcomes, it is important to know the aetiology and peculiarities of sepsis in a particular region and hospital. The aim of this study was to analyse the outcomes of sepsis in a paediatric intensive care unit and their relation with patients' characteristics and causative microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Sepsis Registration System in Vilnius University Children's hospital was started in 2012. From 2012 to 2015, we found 529 sepsis cases in our hospital, 203 of which were found to be fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria (patient's age >28 days on admission, taken blood culture/positive PCR test, need for paediatric ICU hospitalization) and were included in the final analysis. Abbreviations: ICD - international disease classification PCR - polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Sepsis made 4% of all patients of the paediatric ICU in the period from 2012 to 2015 and caused 32% of deaths in the unit. Paediatric mortality reached 14% of all sepsis cases in our analysis, the majority of them due to hospital-acquired sepsis that occurred in patients suffering from oncologic or hematologic diseases. Another significant part of the patients that did not survive were previously healthy with no co-morbidities.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: To determine if a set of time-varying biological indicators can be used to: 1) predict the sepsis mortality risk over time and 2) generate mortality risk profiles. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Nine Canadian ICUs. SUBJECTS: Three-hundred fifty-six septic patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical data and plasma levels of biomarkers were collected longitudinally. We used a complementary log-log model to account for the daily mortality risk of each patient until death in ICU/hospital, discharge, or 28 days after admission. The model, which is a versatile version of the Cox model for gaining longitudinal insights, created a composite indicator (the daily hazard of dying) from the \"day 1\" and \"change\" variables of six time-varying biological indicators (cell-free DNA, protein C, platelet count, creatinine, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and lactate) and a set of contextual variables (age, presence of chronic lung disease or previous brain injury, and duration of stay), achieving a high predictive power (conventional area under the curve, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94). Including change variables avoided misleading inferences about the effects of day 1 variables, signifying the importance of the longitudinal approach. We then generated mortality risk profiles that highlight the relative contributions among the time-varying biological indicators to overall mortality risk. The tool was validated in 28 nonseptic patients from the same ICUs who became septic later and was subject to 10-fold cross-validation, achieving similarly high area under the curve. CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel version of the Cox model, we created a prognostic tool for septic patients that yields not only a predicted probability of dying but also a mortality risk profile that reveals how six time-varying biological indicators differentially and longitudinally account for the patient's overall daily mortality risk.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many cancer survivors experience fatigue as a nagging symptom lasting years after treatment. To learn of the relevant biological pathways involved in fatigue among cancer survivors, the authors tested for an association between fatigue levels and leukocyte gene expression profiles and determined the specific mediating immune cell types. METHODS: A sample of 89 Hispanic/Latino adults aged 60.5 years, 62% of whom were male, who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer and were 2.9 years since diagnosis provided blood for transcriptome profiling and completed a validated measure of fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form). The authors applied genome-wide transcriptional profiling of leukocyte RNA to identify gene expression activity associated with fatigue, tested for the activity of specific transcription factors involved in previously established markers of inflammation and immunologic activation, and identified the specific cell types mediating these transcriptional alterations. RESULTS: In analyses adjusting for demographic and behavioral health risk factors, results linked fatigue with increased activation of B lymphocytes and CD8-positive T cells, as well as several transcription factors involved in immune activation (nuclear factor \u03baB [NF-\u03baB], signal transducer and activator of transcription [STAT], and cAMP responsive element-binding protein [CREB]). Results also replicated several specific genomic effects previously observed in fatigued cancer survivors, including upregulated expression of \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA) and hemoglobin subunits (HBA and HBB). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors' heightened fatigue levels may be partially explained by activation of specific immune cell subsets, thereby providing a potential molecular biomarker for clinical interventions targeting the remediation of fatigue.

Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

        "abstract": "A substantial body of research points to several variables relevant to the etiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD), notably childhood physical and sexual abuse, childhood family environment, and familial aggregation of both internalizing and externalizing disorders. However, these variables tend to be correlated, and few studies have examined them simultaneously. A national sample of randomly selected psychologists and psychiatrists described 524 adult patients with personality disorders. Family environment, parental psychopathology, and history of abuse all independently predicted BPD symptoms in multiple regression analyses. Sexual abuse contributed to the prediction of BPD symptoms over and above family environment, although family environmental factors such as instability partially mediated the effect. The results converge with recent studies using very different samples and methodologies.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cannabis use has been the most commonly used illicit psychoactive substance in India. Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.",

        "abstract": "Impairment in short-term memory and lingering deficit in psychomotor performance are but two of the acute cannabis intoxication components that may have long-term consequences. The former because it affects learning and the latter because it interferes with proper handling of motor vehicles. The most frequently observed complication of cannabis inebriation, however, is a short-lasting acute psychological disturbance with symptoms of panic, paranoid apprehension and personality disorganization. This type of reaction is often not dose-related, and could appropriately be termed \"pathological intoxication\". In addition to the acute effects of cannabis on mental performance and behaviour, this paper reviews the psychiatric consequences of chronic use and the accumulated evidence on organic toxicity associated with it: residual cognitive deficit, lethargic symptoms, cannabis psychosis, respiratory, gastro-intestinal and cardiovascular complications, as well as effects on immune response and gonadal functions, are discussed. Also included are reviews on the pharmacology and therapeutic potential of cannabinoids.",

Autologous bone marrow stem cells may be a better cell source and have been studied for the treatment of cerebral palsy because of their functions in tissue repair and the regulation of immunological processes. METHODS: To assess autologous marrow stem cells as a novel treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe cerebral palsy, a total of 10 cerebral palsy patients were enrolled in this clinical study with 24 months follow-up. A total of 10 cerebral palsy patients received autologous bone marrow cells transplantation (4.5 \u00d7 10 RESULTS: We recorded the gross motor function measurement scores, manual ability function measurement score, and adverse events up to 24 months post-treatment. The gross motor function measurement scores were significantly higher at month 6 post-treatment compared with the baseline scores and were stable up to 24 months follow-up. The increase in manual ability and communication function measurement scores at 6 months were not significant when compared to the baseline score. All the 10 patients survived and none of the patients experienced any serious adverse events or complications. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that bone marrow derived MNCs are safe and effective for the treatment of motor deficits related to cerebral palsy.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence is a prevalent public health issue associated with all-cause maternal mortality. This study investigated the relationship between intimate partner violence, severe acute maternal morbidity in the intensive care unit (ICU), and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study in a hospital in Lima, Peru, with 109 cases (maternal ICU admissions) and 109 controls (obstetric patients not admitted to the ICU). Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and medical record review. Partner violence was assessed using the World Health Organization instrument. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the association between intimate partner violence and severe acute maternal morbidity. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher rate of intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy among cases (58.7%) than controls (27.5%). In multivariate analysis, intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy (aOR 3.83 (95% CI: 1.99-7.37)), being married (3.86 (1.27-11.73)), having <8 antenatal care visits (2.78 (1.14-6.80)), and having previous abortions (miscarriage, therapeutic, or unsafe) (1.69 (1.13-2.51)) were significantly associated with severe acute maternal morbidity. The ICU admission rate was 18.8 (per 1000 live births), and ICU maternal mortality was 1.7%. The perinatal mortality rate was higher in cases (9.3%) than in controls (1.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Intimate partner violence was associated with an increased risk of severe acute maternal morbidity. This suggests a more severe impact of intimate partner violence on pregnancy than has been previously identified.

        "abstract": "Transmembrane proteins (TMEM) are located in the different biological membranes of the cell and have at least one passage through these cellular compartments. TMEM proteins carry out a wide variety of functions necessary to maintain cell homeostasis TMEM165 participates in glycosylation protein, TMEM88 in the development of cardiomyocytes, TMEM45A in epidermal keratinization, and TMEM74 regulating autophagy. However, for many TMEM proteins, their physiological function remains unknown. The role of these proteins is being recently investigated in cancer since transcriptomic and proteomic studies have revealed that exits differential expression of TMEM proteins in different neoplasms concerning cancer-free tissues. Among the cellular processes in which TMEM proteins have been involved in cancer are the promotion or suppression of cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, migration, intravasation/extravasation, metastasis, modulation of the immune response, and response to antineoplastic drugs. Inclusive data suggests that the participation of TMEM proteins in these cellular events could be carried out through involvement in different cell signaling pathways. However, the exact mechanisms not clear. This review shows a description of the involvement of TMEM proteins that promote or decrease cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in cancer cells, describes those TMEM proteins for which both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter role have been identified, depending on the type of cancer in which the protein is expressed. As well as some TMEM proteins involved in chemoresistance. A better characterization of these proteins is required to improve the understanding of the tumors in which their expression and function are altered; in addition to improving the understanding of the role of these proteins in cancer will show those TMEM proteins be potential candidates as biomarkers of response to chemotherapy or prognostic biomarkers or as potential therapeutic targets in cancer.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors. METHODS AND DESIGN: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes. DISCUSSION: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recreational cannabis use and alcohol binge drinking are the most common drug consumption patterns in young adults. Impulsivity and several psychopathological signs are increased in chronic drug users, but the implications of recreational use are still poorly understood. METHODS: We evaluated impulsivity, sensation-seeking traits, impulsive decision-making, inhibitory control and possible symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychosis in three groups of young university adults: recreational cannabis users (N=20), alcohol binge drinkers (N=22) and non-drug users (N=26). RESULTS: The cannabis and binge drinking groups had increased scores for impulsivity and sensation-seeking traits. Both groups also exhibited increased impulsive decision-making on the two-choice task and the Iowa gambling task; however, only the cannabis group was significantly different from the non-drug group regarding inhibitory control (go/no-go and stop tasks). The cannabis and binge drinking groups did not show differences in the psychopathological symptoms evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations of this population of non-dependent drug users are consistent with the increased impulsivity traits and behaviors that have been described previously in chronic drug abusers. In this study, compared to no drug use, the recreational use of cannabis was associated with a major dysfunction of the different facets of impulsive behaviors. However, alcohol binge drinking was related only to impulsive decision-making. These results suggest that impulsivity traits and behaviors are present not only in chronic drug abusers but also in recreational drug users. Future work should continue to investigate the long-term effects of these common consumption patterns on various impulsive behaviors and psychopathological symptoms.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Data on the burden and etiology of neonatal early-onset bacterial sepsis (EOBS) in low-to-middle-income countries are scarce. Surveillance is critical for optimizing prevention and treatment strategies. We aimed to estimate the incidence of EOBS in 2 large Brazilian cohorts of neonates. METHODS: Data were retrospectively obtained from 33,794 neonates born between 2009 and 2017 at low-risk (n = 17,981) and high-risk maternity centers (n = 15,813). Blood cultures were taken within 72 hours of life from neonates with perinatal risk factors for EOBS or suspected EOBS. A positive blood culture for a pathogenic microorganism and a compatible clinical evolution confirmed the diagnosis of EOBS. RESULTS: One-third of the infants born from high-risk and 18.5% from low-risk maternities were investigated for EOBS. Overall, EOBS was more incident in neonates born in the high-risk facilities [66 cases or 4.2/1000 (95% CI: 3.2-5.3)] than in the low-risk facilities [24 cases or 1.3/1000 (95% CI: 0.9-2.0)]. The incidence rate of EOBS increased with decreasing gestational age (<32 weeks: 20.5/1000; 32-36 weeks: 5.6/1000; \u226537 weeks: 1.5/1000). Group B Streptococcus (GBS) was the agent more frequently identified in high-risk and low-risk maternities: 1.8/1000 (95% CI: 1.1-2.4) and 0.4/1000 (95% CI: 0.2-0.9), respectively. EOBS's overall case fatality rate was 17.8% for all the agents and 22% for GBS. CONCLUSIONS: EOBS remains unacceptably high and is frequently fatal in preterm and term infants cared for in high- or low-risk maternities. Because GBS has emerged as the most frequent causative agent, preventive strategies are urgently needed.",

Since this law took effect, increased availability and use of cannabis in Michigan have led to increased emergency department (ED) visits associated with the drug's psychiatric effects. OBJECTIVES: To describe cannabis-induced anxiety disorder's prevalence, clinical features, and disposition in a community-based study. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive patients diagnosed with acute toxicity related to cannabis use (ICD-10 code F12). Patients were seen at seven EDs over a 24-month study period. Data collected included demographics, clinical features, and treatment outcomes in ED patients who met the criteria for cannabis-induced anxiety disorder. This group was compared to a cohort experiencing other forms of acute cannabis toxicity. Chi-squared and t-tests were used to compare these two groups across key demographic and outcome variables. RESULTS: During the study period, 1135 patients were evaluated for acute cannabis toxicity. A total of 196 patients (17.3%) had a chief complaint of anxiety, and 939 (82.7%) experienced other forms of acute cannabis toxicity, predominantly symptoms of intoxication or cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. Patients with anxiety symptoms had panic attacks (11.7%), aggression or manic behavior (9.2%), and hallucinations (6.1%). Compared to patients presenting with other forms of cannabis toxicity, those with anxiety were likelier to be younger, ingested edible cannabis, had psychiatric comorbidities, or had a history of polysubstance abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis-induced anxiety occurred in 17.3% of ED patients in this community-based study. Clinicians must be adept in recognizing, evaluating, managing, and counseling these patients following cannabis exposure.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In December 2018, Michigan became the 10th state to legalize marijuana for adults. Since this law took effect, increased availability and use of cannabis in Michigan have led to increased emergency department (ED) visits associated with the drug's psychiatric effects. OBJECTIVES: To describe cannabis-induced anxiety disorder's prevalence, clinical features, and disposition in a community-based study. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive patients diagnosed with acute toxicity related to cannabis use (ICD-10 code F12). Patients were seen at seven EDs over a 24-month study period.

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of childhood mortality. Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

METHODS: Information letters were sent to all potential participants (n\u2009=\u200927) in the previous study. Semi-structured interviews (21-57 min) were carried out with all subjects who volunteered (n\u2009=\u200915), administered by an experienced interviewer who was not involved in the previous study. Transcribed interviews were subject to content analysis. RESULTS: The 5 categories that emerged from the content analysis were \"New method gives hope\", experiences related to \"Using the assistive technology\", \"Outcome from training with the assistive technology\", \"The assistive technology\" and \"Taking part in the study\". Respondents felt hopeful when included in the previous study, motivated when experiencing a treatment effect, and disappointed when not. CONCLUSION: The qualitative approach used in this study elicited complementary information that was not evident from the previous randomized controlled trial.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Data on the burden and etiology of neonatal early-onset bacterial sepsis (EOBS) in low-to-middle-income countries are scarce. Surveillance is critical for optimizing prevention and treatment strategies. We aimed to estimate the incidence of EOBS in 2 large Brazilian cohorts of neonates. METHODS: Data were retrospectively obtained from 33,794 neonates born between 2009 and 2017 at low-risk (n = 17,981) and high-risk maternity centers (n = 15,813). Blood cultures were taken within 72 hours of life from neonates with perinatal risk factors for EOBS or suspected EOBS. A positive blood culture for a pathogenic microorganism and a compatible clinical evolution confirmed the diagnosis of EOBS. RESULTS: One-third of the infants born from high-risk and 18.5% from low-risk maternities were investigated for EOBS. Overall, EOBS was more incident in neonates born in the high-risk facilities [66 cases or 4.2/1000 (95% CI: 3.2-5.3)] than in the low-risk facilities [24 cases or 1.3/1000 (95% CI: 0.9-2.0)]. The incidence rate of EOBS increased with decreasing gestational age (<32 weeks: 20.5/1000; 32-36 weeks: 5.6/1000; \u226537 weeks: 1.5/1000). Group B Streptococcus (GBS) was the agent more frequently identified in high-risk and low-risk maternities: 1.8/1000 (95% CI: 1.1-2.4) and 0.4/1000 (95% CI: 0.2-0.9), respectively. EOBS's overall case fatality rate was 17.8% for all the agents and 22% for GBS. CONCLUSIONS: EOBS remains unacceptably high and is frequently fatal in preterm and term infants cared for in high- or low-risk maternities. Because GBS has emerged as the most frequent causative agent, preventive strategies are urgently needed.",

        "abstract": "Transmembrane proteins (TMEM) are located in the different biological membranes of the cell and have at least one passage through these cellular compartments. TMEM proteins carry out a wide variety of functions necessary to maintain cell homeostasis TMEM165 participates in glycosylation protein, TMEM88 in the development of cardiomyocytes, TMEM45A in epidermal keratinization, and TMEM74 regulating autophagy. However, for many TMEM proteins, their physiological function remains unknown. The role of these proteins is being recently investigated in cancer since transcriptomic and proteomic studies have revealed that exits differential expression of TMEM proteins in different neoplasms concerning cancer-free tissues. Among the cellular processes in which TMEM proteins have been involved in cancer are the promotion or suppression of cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, migration, intravasation/extravasation, metastasis, modulation of the immune response, and response to antineoplastic drugs. Inclusive data suggests that the participation of TMEM proteins in these cellular events could be carried out through involvement in different cell signaling pathways. However, the exact mechanisms not clear. This review shows a description of the involvement of TMEM proteins that promote or decrease cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in cancer cells, describes those TMEM proteins for which both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter role have been identified, depending on the type of cancer in which the protein is expressed. As well as some TMEM proteins involved in chemoresistance. A better characterization of these proteins is required to improve the understanding of the tumors in which their expression and function are altered; in addition to improving the understanding of the role of these proteins in cancer will show those TMEM proteins be potential candidates as biomarkers of response to chemotherapy or prognostic biomarkers or as potential therapeutic targets in cancer.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Cannabis use has been the most commonly used illicit psychoactive substance in India. Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.",

At the same time, there has been an increase in the concentration of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol contained in cannabis. The aims of our study are to measure addictive and psychiatric comorbidities in cannabis users in France, and to compare characteristics between women and men. METHODS: Three hundred and forty-two\u00a0heavy cannabis users seen in a cannabis clinic between 2004 and 2014 were assessed during a 2-h clinical interview (DSM-IV, MINI). RESULTS: 83.2% of users are currently cannabis dependent, 10.6% alcohol dependent, and 2.1% cocaine/crack dependent. 37.8% have a current mood disorder, 47.6% have a current anxiety disorder, and 8.8% are psychotic.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: To determine if a set of time-varying biological indicators can be used to: 1) predict the sepsis mortality risk over time and 2) generate mortality risk profiles. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Nine Canadian ICUs. SUBJECTS: Three-hundred fifty-six septic patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical data and plasma levels of biomarkers were collected longitudinally. We used a complementary log-log model to account for the daily mortality risk of each patient until death in ICU/hospital, discharge, or 28 days after admission. The model, which is a versatile version of the Cox model for gaining longitudinal insights, created a composite indicator (the daily hazard of dying) from the \"day 1\" and \"change\" variables of six time-varying biological indicators (cell-free DNA, protein C, platelet count, creatinine, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and lactate) and a set of contextual variables (age, presence of chronic lung disease or previous brain injury, and duration of stay), achieving a high predictive power (conventional area under the curve, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94). Including change variables avoided misleading inferences about the effects of day 1 variables, signifying the importance of the longitudinal approach. We then generated mortality risk profiles that highlight the relative contributions among the time-varying biological indicators to overall mortality risk. The tool was validated in 28 nonseptic patients from the same ICUs who became septic later and was subject to 10-fold cross-validation, achieving similarly high area under the curve. CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel version of the Cox model, we created a prognostic tool for septic patients that yields not only a predicted probability of dying but also a mortality risk profile that reveals how six time-varying biological indicators differentially and longitudinally account for the patient's overall daily mortality risk.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors. METHODS AND DESIGN: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes. DISCUSSION: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

Alterations to the intestinal microbiota community structure increase the risk of CDI. FMT is a safe and effective treatment for\u00a0recurrent CDI in immunocompetent children and adults. While there are increasing data that FMT in immunosuppressed patients is safe and effective without increased risk of infection, data regarding safety and efficacy of FMT in children after SOT are limited. To our knowledge, we report the youngest immunocompromised patient to undergo FMT and the third overall case of FMT in a child after HTx. Our patient presented with five episodes of rCDI in 6\u00a0months, and 16S rRNA genetic analysis revealed significant loss of overall microbiota community structure and diversity prior to FMT compared with a donor and a healthy, age-matched control. After FMT, marked and prolonged (at least 16\u00a0months) shifts in the recipient microbiota community structure and diversity were evident, approaching that of donor and healthy, age-matched control. FMT was well tolerated, restored microbial diversity without any graft or transplant complications, and prevented further rCDI episodes after more than 4\u00a0years of follow-up.",

        "abstract": "Aggressive behaviors and disruptive/conduct disorders are some of the commonest reasons for referral to youth mental health services; nevertheless, the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in real-world clinical practice remains unclear. In order to define more appropriate targets for innovative pharmacological therapies for disruptive/conduct disorders, the European Commission within the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) funded the MATRICS project (Multidisciplinary Approaches to Translational Research in Conduct Syndromes) to identify neural, genetic, and molecular factors underpinning the pathogenesis of aggression/antisocial behavior in preclinical models and clinical samples. Within the program, a multicentre case-control study, followed by a single-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, randomized acute single-dose medication challenge, was conducted at two Italian sites. Aggressive children and adolescents with conduct disorder (CD) or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) were compared to the same age (10-17 y) typically developing controls (TDC) on a neuropsychological tasks battery that included both \"cold\" (e.g., inhibitory control, decision making) and \"hot\" executive functions (e.g., moral judgment, emotion processing, risk assessment). Selected autonomic measures (heart rate variability, skin conductance, salivary cortisol) were recorded before/during/after neuropsychological testing sessions. The acute response to different drugs (methylphenidate/atomoxetine, risperidone/aripiprazole, or placebo) was also examined in the ODD/CD cohort in order to identify potential neuropsychological/physiological mechanisms underlying aggression. The paper describes the protocol of the clinical MATRICS WP6-1 study, its rationale, the specific outcome measures, and their implications for a precision medicine approach.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is unmet need for male contraceptive options, but a recent injectable combination male contraceptive trial was terminated early due to adverse events (AEs). METHODS: We examined the frequency of reported AEs by male research participants compared with AEs reported in prescribing information of approved female hormonal contraceptive methods. Published data from trials of the top five most-used female hormonal contraceptives, supplemented by contemporary contraceptive research, were compared with the frequency of AEs reported in a male injectable hormonal contraceptive trial. RESULTS: We observed similar frequencies of AEs reported by users of male contraceptives compared with those reported by female users. Among quantitatively comparable AEs, compared with men, women reported experiencing higher frequencies of headaches, pelvic pain, and weight gain and similar frequencies of decreased libido. Compared with women, men reported experiencing higher frequencies of acne and mood changes. Men discontinued participation due to AEs at a lower frequency than women. CONCLUSIONS: Female hormonal methods generally have similar frequencies of AEs to those reported in a recent male hormonal contraceptive trial, and male users had lower rates of discontinuation due to AEs. There were fewer serious AEs of the male contraceptive than reported in contemporary female trials which resulted in FDA licensure. This suggests there may be implicit bias in the scientific community regarding the level of acceptable risk for users of male contraceptive methods.",

        "title": "Pharmacoacupuncture for the Treatment of Frozen Shoulder: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Frozen shoulder (FS) is one of the most challenging shoulder disorders for patients and clinicians. Its symptoms mainly include any combination of stiffness, nocturnal pain, and limitation of active and passive glenohumeral joint movement. Conventional treatment options for FS are physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, injection therapy, and arthroscopic capsular release, but adverse and limited effects continue to present problems. As a result, pharmacoacupuncture (PA) is getting attention as an alternative therapy for patients with FS. PA is a new form of acupuncture treatment in traditional Korean medicine (TKM) that is mainly used for musculoskeletal diseases. It has similarity and specificity compared to corticosteroid injection and hydrodilatation, making it a potential alternative injection therapy for FS. However, no systematic reviews investigating the utilization of PA for FS have been published. Therefore, this review aims to standardize the clinical use of PA for FS and validate its therapeutic effect. METHODS: The protocol was registered in Prospero (CRD42023445708) on 18 July 2023. Until Aug. 31, 2023, seven electronic databases will be searched for randomized controlled trials of PA for FS. Authors will be contacted, and manual searches will also be performed. Two reviewers will independently screen and collect data from retrieved articles according to predefined criteria. The primary outcome will be pain intensity, and secondary outcomes will be effective rate, Constant-Murley Score, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index, range of motion, quality of life, and adverse events. Bias and quality of the included trials will be assessed using the Cochrane handbook's risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. Meta analyses will be conducted using Review Manager V.5.3 software. GRADE will be used to evaluate the level of evidence for each outcome. RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted following PRISMA statement. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: This review will provide scientific evidence to support health insurance policy as well as the standardization of PA in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "The usual phenomena of cannabis intoxication include experiences which in a non-intoxicated state would be considered as psychiatric symptoms. These can be distinguished from adverse reactions to cannabis, the commonest of which is an acute anxiety state. Acute psychotic episodes can also follow ingestion of the drug but are infrequent. These can be classified as acute confusional states and episodes occurring in clear consciousness. Neither presentation consistently shows enough specific features to warrant the diagnosis of 'cannabis psychosis' as a distinct clinical entity. The evidence that cannabis has a causative role in chronic psychotic or affective disorders is not convincing, although the drug may modify the course of an already established illness. Further controlled studies would be required to clarify the aetiological significance of the drug in these conditions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mental health problems and risk behaviours among young people are of great public health concern. Consequently, within the VII Framework Programme, the European Commission funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in eleven European countries, with Sweden as the coordinating centre, and was designed to identify an effective way to promote mental health and reduce suicidality and risk taking behaviours among adolescents. OBJECTIVE: To describe the methodological and field procedures in the SEYLE RCT among adolescents, as well as to present the main characteristics of the recruited sample. METHODS: Analyses were conducted to determine: 1) representativeness of study sites compared to respective national data; 2) response rate of schools and pupils, drop-out rates from baseline to 3 and 12 month follow-up, 3) comparability of samples among the four Intervention Arms; 4) properties of the standard scales employed: Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), World Health Organization Well-Being Scale (WHO-5). RESULTS: Participants at baseline comprised 12,395 adolescents (M/F: 5,529/6,799; mean age=14.9\u00b10.9) from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. At the 3 and 12 months follow up, participation rates were 87.3% and 79.4%, respectively. Demographic characteristics of participating sites were found to be reasonably representative of their respective national population. Overall response rate of schools was 67.8%. All scales utilised in the study had good to very good internal reliability, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (BDI-II: 0.864; Z-SAS: 0.805; SDQ: 0.740; WHO-5: 0.799). CONCLUSIONS: SEYLE achieved its objective of recruiting a large representative sample of adolescents within participating European countries. Analysis of SEYLE data will shed light on the effectiveness of important interventions aimed at improving adolescent mental health and well-being, reducing risk-taking and self-destructive behaviour and preventing suicidality.

        "abstract": "Trofinetide is a first-in-class pharmacological treatment proposed for patients with Rett Syndrome. It is a long half-life derivative of glycine-proline-glutamate, the tripeptide normally excided from Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 upon degradation. Due to containing glutamate and glycine in its structure, trofinetide is thought to act through NMDA receptor modulation, thus providing a normalization of neuronal activity and survival. Trofinetide was tested in a series of short and long-term trials, showing good efficacy at improving scores on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale and Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire, with specific effect only on some subscales, ie General Mood subscale and Repetitive Face Movement subscale. No effects were documented on other subscales or on epilepsy, heart and bone -related symptoms. The main adverse effects of trofinetide, severe enough to determine discontinuation, include diarrhea, vomiting, and consequent weight loss. These may be scarcely avoidable, given the need to assume a very large amount of trofinetide per day. Other inherent limitations of use possibly regard the limited duration of drug supplies, as one bottle may last three days only, depending on weight, and the relatively high cost per bottle. Trofinetide has no direct competitors: single symptoms of the Rett Syndrome, for instance, seizures or aggressive behaviors, are currently treated with drugs that have been developed for patients without the Rett Syndrome. This leads to suboptimal efficacy and increased risk of adverse effects. The place in therapy of trofinetide is yet to be determined, based on the results of clinical trials, on its practical usability, and on the windows of opportunity for intervention. Moreover, trofinetide may be curative if given early enough during brain development, or merely symptomatic if given to young adults, and no data exist on this aspect. The place in therapy of trofinetide will require reassessment after competing treatments enter the market.",

        "abstract": "Better scientific understanding of cannabis effects and the development of treatments for cannabis dependence require clinical studies involving cannabis administration. Cannabis can be administered by smoking a plant-derived cigarette or by oral or intravenous administration of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive chemical in cannabis. The smoked route is most commonly used outside the laboratory, but is subject to wide variation in absorbed dose. Oral synthetic THC is a legally marketed medication (dronabinol), also subject to wide pharmacokinetic variation, but offering a greater safety margin because of slower onset of action and lower potency. Intravenous THC offers precise investigator control of dose and timing. Acute adverse effects of cannabis administration include tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, pulmonary irritation (if smoked), motor incoordination, cognitive impairment, anxiety, paranoia, and psychosis. Screening of research subjects should identify and exclude those with risk factors for such events, e.g., a history of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, or psychiatric disorders. Monitoring of subjects during cannabis administration should include heart rate, blood pressure, and mental status. Subjects should not be discharged from research participation until reevaluation has shown that they have returned to baseline status.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Male hormonal contraception has been an elusive goal. Administration of sex steroids to men can shut off sperm production through effects on the pituitary and hypothalamus. However, this approach also decreases production of testosterone, so \"add-back\" therapy is needed. OBJECTIVES: To summarize all randomized controlled trials of male hormonal contraception. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the computerized databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Popline, and LILACS (each from inception to February, 2003) for randomized controlled trials of hormonal contraception in men. We wrote to authors of identified trials to seek unpublished or published trials that we might have missed. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized controlled trials in any language that compared a steroid hormone with another contraceptive. We excluded non-steroidal male contraceptives, such as gossypol. We included both placebo and active-regimen control groups. All trials identified included only healthy men with normal semen analyses. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Azoospermia (absence of spermatozoa on semen examination) was the primary outcome measure. Data were insufficient to examine pregnancy rates and side effects. MAIN RESULTS: The proportion of men who achieved azoospermia varied widely in reports to date. Few significant differences emerged from these trials. Levonorgestrel implants combined with injectable testosterone enanthate (100 mg IM) was significantly more effective than was levonorgestrel 125 mcg by mouth daily combined with testosterone patches (10 mg/d) (OR for azoospermia with the oral levonorgestrel regimen 0.03; 95%CI 0.00-0.29). The addition of levonorgestrel 500 mcg by mouth daily improved the effectiveness of testosterone enanthate 100 mg IM weekly by itself (OR for azoospermia with the combined regimen 4.0; 95%CI 1.00-15.99). Several regimens, including testosterone alone and GnRH agonists and antagonists, had disappointing results. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: No male hormonal contraceptive is ready for clinical use. All trials published to date have been small exploratory studies. As a result, their power to detect important differences has been limited and their results imprecise. In addition, the definition of oligospermia has been imprecise or inconsistent in many reports. To avoid bias, future trials need more attention to the methodological requirements for randomized controlled trials. Trials with adequate power would also be helpful.",

DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). PATIENTS: Ninety-four children. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Leucocyte count, PCT and CRP were measured when considered necessary during the PICU stay. Patients were classified, when PCT and CRP were measured, into one of six categories (negative, SIRS, localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock) according to the definitions of the American College of Chest Physicians /Society of Critical Care Medicine. A total of 359 patient day episodes were obtained. Leucocyte count did not differ across the six diagnostic classes considered. Median plasma PCT concentrations were 0.17, 0.43, 0.79, 1.80, 15.40 and 19.13 ng/ml in negative, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock groups, respectively, whereas median plasma CRP concentrations were 1.35, 3.80, 6.45, 5.70, 7.60 and 16.2 mg/dl, respectively. The area under the ROC curve for the diagnosis of septic patients was 0.532 for leucocyte count (95% CI, 0.462-0.602), 0.750 for CRP (95% CI, 0.699-0.802) and 0.912 for PCT (95% CI, 0.882-0.943). We obtained four groups using CRP values and five groups using PCT values that classified a significant percentage of patients according to the severity of the different SIRS groups. CONCLUSIONS: PCT is a better diagnostic marker of sepsis in critically ill children than CRP. The CRP, and especially PCT, may become a helpful clinical tool to stratify patients with SIRS according to disease severity.",

        "abstract": "Despite the fact that about 150 millions women must have taken hormonal contraceptives all over the world since the 1960s, the risk/benefit ratio of this birth control method has yet not been reliably assessed. The side effects of the pill on the skin do not pertain, in general, to those (like thrombo-embolism or, perhaps, breast cancer) which might be life-threatening, but they are probably more frequent and may have a potential to alter the quality of life of women who use it. The aim of this paper is to review the dermatological effects of hormonal contraceptives from the point of view of everyday prescribing, with the emphasis on the quality of life of patients. The reported side effects of the pill are therefore classified according to their real or probable frequency, not to their severity or the theoretical importance of their mechanisms. As it would be unwise to speak of the risks without consideration for the benefits, an attempt is made to compare the dermatological safety profile of oral contraceptives to that of other birth control methods (barrier contraceptive methods, intrauterine devices, etc.) on the one hand; on the other hand, one insists upon the fact that the pill in itself may have health benefits, general (reduction in the incidence of some cancers) or dermatological (e. g. an effect on acne).",

To prevent adverse psychosocial outcomes in young carers (YCs), primary prevention resilience building interventions have been recommended. We describe the study protocol of an international randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an innovative group intervention designed to promote the mental health and well-being of adolescent YCs (AYCs) aged 15-17. The RCT will be conducted in six European countries in the context of the Horizon 2020 European funded research and innovation project \"Psychosocial support for promoting mental health and well-being among adolescent young caregivers in Europe\" (\"ME-WE\"). The ME-WE intervention is based on Hayes and Ciarrochi's psychoeducational model for adolescents and will consist of seven 2-h sessions in a group format, aimed to help AYCs build psychological flexibility and live according to their values. The control group will be a waitlist. Primary and secondary outcomes and control variables will be measured at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and 3 months follow-up (T2). The COVID-19 pandemic has made amendments necessary to the original study protocol methodology, which we describe in detail. This study will contribute to building an evidence-based manualized program that educators and health and social care professionals can use to support AYCs in their transition to adulthood. From a research perspective, the outcomes of this study will contribute to evidence-based practices in primary prevention of psychosocial difficulties in AYCs and will gather novel knowledge on the effectiveness of Hayes and Ciarrochi's model for use with middle adolescents with caring responsibilities. The trial has been preregistered (registration number: NCT04114864).",

It has been postulated that exogenous toxicants, including pesticides, might be involved in the etiology of PD. In this article we present a comprehensive review of the published epidemiologic and toxicologic literature and critically evaluate whether a relationship exists between pesticide exposure and PD. From the epidemiologic literature, there does appear to be a relatively consistent relationship between pesticide exposure and PD. This relationship appears strongest for exposure to herbicides and insecticides, and after long durations of exposure. Toxicologic data suggest that paraquat and rotenone may have neurotoxic actions that potentially play a role in the development of PD, with limited data for other pesticides. However, both the epidemiology and toxicology studies were limited by methodologic weaknesses. Particular issues of current and future interest include multiple exposures (both pesticides and other exogenous toxicants), developmental exposures, and gene-environment interactions. At present, the weight of evidence is sufficient to conclude that a generic association between pesticide exposure and PD exists but is insufficient for concluding that this is a causal relationship or that such a relationship exists for any particular pesticide compound or combined pesticide and other exogenous toxicant exposure.",

        "title": "Male contraception is coming: Who do men want to prescribe their birth control?",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess men's preferences for healthcare provider from whom they would obtain hormonal male contraceptive (HMC) methods. STUDY DESIGN: We asked participants from 3 clinical trials of investigational HMC methods-an oral pill (11\u03b2-Methyl-19-nortestosterone-17\u03b2-dodecylcarbonate, 11\u03b2-MNTDC), intramuscular or subcutaneous injection (Dimethandrolone undecanoate), and transdermal gel (Nestorone and testosterone)-to rank their top 3 preferred HMC providers from a list including: men's health doctor (urologist/andrologist), hormonal doctor (endocrinologist), reproductive health doctor (OB/GYN), family planning clinician (community health worker, midwife, nurse practitioner), regular doctor (family medicine/internal medicine), and community pharmacist. We examined preferences based on their rankings and conducted bivariate analyses. Collapsing the various specialists (men's health doctor, hormonal doctor, reproductive health doctor, and family planning clinician) into a single provider type, we examined participant demographics against provider preference (regular doctor, pharmacist, or specialist). RESULTS: Participants across the 3 trials (n\u00a0=\u00a0124) ranked their regular doctor (44%) and community pharmacist (18%) as their most preferred HMC provider; these preferences did not differ significantly by trial and drug formulation. Specialists in family planning (13%), men's health (12%), reproductive health (10%), and hormones (4%) were least frequently ranked as their preferred provider. Older and higher educated participants more often preferred specialists over regular doctors and pharmacists (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). CONCLUSIONS: Despite receiving contraceptive steroid hormones and care from endocrinologists and family planning specialists in a clinical trial, participants would prefer to obtain contraception from their regular doctor. IMPLICATIONS: As most men expect to obtain hormonal male contraceptives from their regular doctor when commercially available, primary care physicians should become familiar with HMCs and be prepared to provide counseling and options accordingly.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Results of assisted reproductive techniques from treatments initiated in Europe during 2005 are presented in this ninth report. Data were mainly collected from existing national registers. METHODS: From 30 countries, 923 clinics reported 418 111 treatment cycles including: IVF (118 074), ICSI (203 329), frozen embryo replacement (79 140), oocyte donation (ED, 11 475), preimplantation genetic diagnosis/screening (5846) and in vitro maturation (247). Overall, this represents a 13.6% increase since 2004, partly due to inclusion of 28 417 cycles from Turkey. European data on intrauterine insemination using husband/partner's semen (IUI-H) and donor semen (IUI-D) were reported from 21 countries and included 128 908 IUI-H and 20 568 IUI-D cycles. RESULTS: In 16 countries where all clinics reported to the IVF register, 1115 cycles were performed per million inhabitants. For IVF, the clinical pregnancy rates per aspiration and per transfer were 26.9% and 30.3%, respectively. For ICSI, the corresponding rates were 28.5% and 30.9%. After IUI-H, the clinical pregnancy rate was 12.6% per insemination in women <40. After IVF and ICSI, the distribution of transfer of one, two, three and four or more embryos was 20.0%, 56.1%, 21.5% and 2.3%, respectively. Huge differences exist between countries. The distribution of singleton, twin and triplet deliveries after IVF and ICSI was 78.2%, 21.0% and 0.8%, respectively. This gives a total multiple delivery rate of 21.8% compared with 22.7% in 2004 and 23.1% in 2003. In women <40 years of age, IUI-H was associated with a twin and triplet pregnancy rate of 11.0% and 1.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with earlier years, there was an increase in the reported number of ART cycles in Europe. Although fewer embryos were transferred per treatment, there was a marginal increase in pregnancy rates and a reduction in multiple deliveries.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Condoms and vasectomy are male-controlled family planning methods but suffer from limitations in compliance (condoms) and limited reversibility (vasectomy); thus many couples desire other options. Hormonal male contraceptive methods have undergone extensive clinical trials in healthy men and shown to be efficacious, reversible and appear to be well tolerated. RECENT FINDINGS: The success rate of male hormonal contraception using injectable testosterone alone is high and comparable to methods for women. Addition of progestins to androgens improved the rate of suppression of spermatogenesis. Supported by government or nongovernment organizations, current studies aim to find the best combination of testosterone and progestins for effective spermatogenesis suppression and to explore other delivery methods for these hormones. Translation of these advances to widespread use in the developed world will need the manufacturing and marketing skills of the pharmaceutical industry. Availability of male contraceptives to the developing world may require commitments of governmental and nongovernmental agencies. In a time when imbalance of basic resources and population needs are obvious, this may prove to be a very wise investment. SUMMARY: Male hormonal contraception is efficacious, reversible and well tolerated for the target population of younger men in stable relationships. Suppression of spermatogenesis is achieved with a combination of an androgen and a progestin. Partnership with industry will accelerate the marketing of a male hormonal contraceptive. Research is ongoing on selective androgen and progesterone receptor modulators that suppress spermatogenesis, minimize potential adverse events while retaining the androgenic and gonadotropin suppressive actions.",

The aim of the study was to compare the metabolic profiles of plasma and urine samples collected at birth from preterm neonates with and without earlyonset sepsis (EOS) to identify metabolic perturbations that might orient the search for new early biomarkers. All preterm newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were eligible for this proof-of-concept, prospective case-control study. Infants were enrolled as \"cases\" if they developed EOS, and as \"controls\"if they did not. Plasma samples collected at birth and urine samples collected within 24 h of birth underwent untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis using mass spectrometry coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Of 123 eligible newborns, 15 developed EOS. These 15 newborns matched controls for gestational age and weight. Metabolomic analysis revealed evident clustering of the cases versus controls, with the glutathione and tryptophan metabolic pathways markedly disrupted in the former. In conclusion, neonates with EOS had a metabolic profile at birth that clearly distinguished them from those without sepsis, and metabolites of glutathione and tryptophan pathways are promising as new biomarkers of neonatal sepsis.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The US Food and Drug Administration authorized lecanemab for the therapeutic use of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in January 2023. To assess the effectiveness and safety of lecanemab in treating AD, we thoroughly examined the studies that are currently accessible. METHOD: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations were followed. In order to find relevant studies on lecanemab, we carried out a thorough literature search utilizing the electronic databases MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, and Scopus. Excluding any research using experimental animals, we looked at lecanemab's effectiveness and side effects in treating AD in human clinical trials. Three randomized controlled studies were included. FINDINGS: According to studies, lecanemab lessens clinical deterioration and reduces brain amyloid-beta plaques (difference,.45; 95% confidence interval,.67 to.23; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Participants who received lecanemab saw a greater frequency of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA)-H (17.3% vs. 9.0%) and ARIA-E (12.6% vs. 1.7%), which is a significant adverse outcome. CONCLUSION: Lecanemab has been shown to have an impact on the two primary pathophysiologic indicators of AD (A\u03b2 and tau). There are still a lot of unresolved issues related to lecanemab. Future research on the effectiveness and safety of lecanemab is advised in order to determine that the advantages of this medication exceed the disadvantages.",

        "abstract": "The potential health effects of exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) remain largely unexplored. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotides, which are used to silence target genes, are gaining attention as a novel drug discovery modality for proteinopathies. However, while clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been conducted in recent years, the results have not always been favorable. The results from a Phase III trial of the antisense oligonucleotide, that is, tofersen, which targets SOD1 mRNA, showed decreased levels of cerebrospinal fluid SOD1 and plasma neurofilament light chain but no improvements in primary clinical endpoint. Moreover, case reports pertaining to patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis carrying FUS and C9orf72 mutations who received antisense oligonucleotide-based treatments have demonstrated a notable reduction in the targeted protein (thus providing the proof of mechanism) but with no discernible clinical benefits. There are several possible reasons why antisense oligonucleotides knockdown fails to achieve proof of concept, which need to be addressed: on-target adverse effects resulting from the loss of function of target gene and irreversible neuronal death cascade due to toxic protein accumulation, among other factors. This review provides an overview of the current status and discusses the prospects of antisense oligonucleotides treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

However, associations between adolescent cannabis use, depression and anxiety disorders are inconsistently reported in longitudinal samples. AIMS: To study associations of adolescent cannabis use with depression and anxiety disorders. METHOD: We used data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986, linked to nationwide registers, to study the association between adolescent cannabis use and depression and anxiety disorders until 33 years of age (until 2018). RESULTS: We included 6325 participants (48.8% male) in the analyses; 352 (5.6%) participants reported cannabis use until 15-16 years of age. By the end of the follow-up, 583 (9.2%) participants were diagnosed with unipolar depression and 688 (10.9%) were diagnosed with anxiety disorder. Cannabis use in adolescence was associated with an increased risk of depression and anxiety disorders in crude models. After adjusting for parental psychiatric disorder, baseline emotional and behavioural problems, demographic factors and other substance use, using cannabis five or more times was associated with increased risk of anxiety disorders (hazard ratio 2.01, 95% CI 1.15-3.82), and using cannabis once (hazard ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.30-2.87) or two to four times (hazard ratio 2.02, 95% CI 1.24-3.31) was associated with increased risk of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in adolescence was associated with an increased risk of future depression and anxiety disorders. Further research is needed to clarify if this is a causal association, which could then inform public health messages about the use of cannabis in adolescence.",

The use of these three procedures to diagnose comorbid learning problems produced significantly different results. All methods identified significant numbers of children in the clinical population as learning disabled; however, each method identified children with differing characteristics. Consistent with predictions from measurement theory, the commonly used simple standard score discrepancy method was more likely to identify children with above-average IQs as learning disabled, whereas a regression approach identified learning disabilities more consistently across the ability range.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Factor XIa inhibitors are a promising novel class of anticoagulants that attenuate pathological thrombosis with minimal interference with hemostasis. These effects contrast with those of conventional anticoagulants, which may exhibit adverse events of untoward bleeding precluding treatment in some patients. A variety of investigational pharmacological modalities have been developed and studied to target factor XIa. SUMMARY: Asundexian is a small molecule inhibitor of factor XIa that has been evaluated in several clinical studies. It has been studied as an oral, once-daily medication and found to inhibit approximately 90% of factor XIa activity at doses of 20 to 50 mg. Phase 2 trials have demonstrated the potential for improved safety compared to standard of care in certain treatment settings, such as in atrial fibrillation. For other indications, such as noncardioembolic stroke and acute myocardial infarction, asundexian has been used in addition to background antiplatelet therapy. In these instances, asundexian did not show a difference in the incidence of bleeding events compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: Phase 3 trials have recently been launched; however, the OCEANIC-AF trial was prematurely discontinued due to inefficacy of asundexian vs apixaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Another phase 3 trial, OCEANIC-AFINA, is planned to compare asundexian to placebo in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk for stroke who are deemed ineligible for anticoagulation.",

DDR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). RTKs can translocate to the nucleus  METHODS: To determine whether DDR1 translocates to the nucleus and whether this event is mediated by collagen-induced DDR1 activation, we generated renal cells expressing wild-type or mutant forms of DDR1 no longer able to bind collagen. Then, we determined the location of the DDR1 upon collagen stimulation. Using both biochemical assays and immunofluorescence, we analyzed the steps involved in DDR1 nuclear translocation. RESULTS: We show that although DDR1 and its natural ligand, collagen, lack an NLS, DDR1 is present in the nucleus of injured human and mouse kidney proximal tubules. We show that DDR1 nuclear translocation requires collagen-mediated receptor activation and interaction of DDR1 with SEC61B, a component of the Sec61 translocon, and nonmuscle myosin IIA and  CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a novel mechanism whereby activated DDR1 translates to the nucleus to regulate synthesis of profibrotic molecules.",

        "abstract": "Depression in children and adolescents is associated with poor psychosocial functioning, high psychiatric comorbidity, risk of recurrent episodes or onset of bipolar disorder. These findings emphasize the importance of early identification of children and adolescents having elevated risk for future depression and further development, evaluation and greater availability of prevention strategies. Our review aims an update about depressive vulnerability in children and adolescents in the perspective of better identification of at-risk populations and targeting of prevention programs. Psychopathology, in particular anxiety and disruptive disorders are well identified risk-factors for later depression. Subclinical depressive symptomatology, also termed \"demoralization\", also identifies high-risk populations, likely to become incident cases of depression. It is still unclear whether this condition is prodromal depression, a specific clinical entity or the expression of biological and/or cognitive vulnerability. Familial risk for depressive disorders involves both genetic and psychosocial factors. Marital discord, poor communication and dysfunctional parenting practices are often present in families with affective disorders and can be implicated in increased depressive vulnerability in the offspring. Research on individual vulnerability in children and adolescents has focused on temperamental and cognitive characteristics. Temperament traits describe individual differences in reactivity and behavior. High emotionality, defined as the tendency to become upset easily and intensely has been associated with an increased risk for subsequent major depression. However, as the majority of high scorers will not become depressive cases, emotionality should not be the only criterion for selection of at-risk populations. Cognitive style including poor self esteem, low social competence and negative attributions are also associated with increased likelihood of depressive symptoms, but their predictive value for the onset of clinical depressive episodes needs further investigation. Familial and individual vulnerability is likely to heighten the depressogenic impact of life events and psycho-social adversity. Prevention interventions have been developed in the United States for children and adolescents at-risk for depression. In France, clinicians witness growing demands from families with affective illness concerned with risk of parent-child transmission of depressive vulnerability, prevention and early identification of symptoms. To meet this kind of emerging needs and to prevent family dysfunction, a preventive program targets offspring of depressed parents and uses clinician-based family approaches. Family and individual sessions aim a better understanding of illness experience and encourage the parents to identify and foster resilience in their children. Another type of preventive intervention focuses on children and adolescents with subclinical depressive symptoms, eventually associated with behavioral problems ou high level of parental conflict, recruited in school settings. These school-based interventions combine cognitive and social problem-solving techniques. Both familial and school-based preventive interventions have proven applicable and promising in high-risk children and adolescents. Perspectives are more systematic identification of risk groups, including youngsters with past or current non affective symptoms who might benefit from depression prevention, long-term evaluation and cross-cultural applications of prevention programs.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety, efficacy, and relative expense of a nurse-led fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) program for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study design in children aged 1-18 years with recurrent CDI. The intervention was an intragastric FMT with stool derived from a donor stool bank. Primary outcome was resolution of diarrhea at 3 months post-transplantation. A secondary analysis compared charge data associated with FMT by intragastric delivery vs administration by colonoscopy or nasoduodenal tube. RESULTS: A total of 47 intragastric FMT procedures were performed in 42 children (median age 9 years) with recurrent CDI. Response to treatment varied by disease status, with 94% success in previously healthy children, 75% in medically complex children, and 54% in children with inflammatory bowel disease (P\u2009=\u2009.04). FMT via intragastric delivery showed lower facility and professional charges by 85% and 78% compared with delivery via colonoscopy and radiology-placed nasoduodenal tube, respectively. The use of stool derived from a donor stool bank decreased charges by 49% compared with charges associated with the use of a donor who was a relative. CONCLUSION: A nurse-led intragastric FMT procedure using stool derived from a donor stool bank is a relatively inexpensive and efficacious treatment for recurrent CDI in children. Intragastric FMT success in children was attenuated by the presence of underlying disease, particularly inflammatory bowel disease.",

The developmental origins of most pediatric cancers make them ideal targets for immune-based therapies that capitalize on the differential expression of lineage-specific cell surface molecules such as antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, or CAR T cells, while the efficacy of other therapies that depend on tumor immunogenicity such as immune checkpoint inhibitors has been limited to date.

        "abstract": "B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a member of the tumor necrosis factor family of receptors, is predominantly expressed on the surface of terminally differentiated B cells. BCMA is highly expressed on plasmablasts and plasma cells from multiple myeloma (MM) patient samples. We developed a BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody (teclistamab [JNJ-64007957]) to recruit and activate T cells to kill BCMA-expressing MM cells. Teclistamab induced cytotoxicity of BCMA+ MM cell lines in vitro (H929 cells, 50% effective concentration [EC50] = 0.15 nM; MM.1R cells, EC50 = 0.06 nM; RPMI 8226 cells, EC50 = 0.45 nM) with concomitant T-cell activation (H929 cells, EC50 = 0.21 nM; MM.1R cells, EC50 = 0.1 nM; RPMI 8226 cells, EC50 = 0.28 nM) and cytokine release. This activity was further increased in the presence of a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor (LY-411575). Teclistamab also depleted BCMA+ cells in bone marrow samples from MM patients in an ex vivo assay with an average EC50 value of 1.7 nM. Under more physiological conditions using healthy human whole blood, teclistamab mediated dose-dependent lysis of H929 cells and activation of T cells. Antitumor activity of teclistamab was also observed in 2 BCMA+ MM murine xenograft models inoculated with human T cells (tumor inhibition with H929 model and tumor regression with the RPMI 8226 model) compared with vehicle and antibody controls. The specific and potent activity of teclistamab against BCMA-expressing cells from MM cell lines, patient samples, and MM xenograft models warrant further evaluation of this bispecific antibody for the treatment of MM. Phase 1 clinical trials (monotherapy, #NCT03145181; combination therapy, #NCT04108195) are ongoing for patients with relapsed/refractory MM.",

The sample consisted of 115 dyads with children's ages ranging from 1 to 47 months. Sixty-four dyads were recruited from community settings without known violence problems, and 51 dyads were recruited from clinical settings and already had been identified with violence problems or as being at risk for violence problems. To classify the dyads on the PIR-GAS categories, caregiver-child interactions were video-recorded and coded with observational scales appropriate for child age. To test whether the PIR-GAS allows for reliable identification of dyads with abusive relationship patterns, PIR-GAS ratings were compared with scores on the the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect's (ISPCAN) Child Abuse Screening Tool-Parental Version (ICAST-P; D.K. Runyan et\u00a0al., ), a questionnaire measuring abusive parental disciplinary practices. It was found that PIR-GAS ratings differentiated between the general and the clinical sample, and the dyads with abusive patterns of relationship were identified by both the PIR-GAS and the ICAST-P. Interrater reliability for the PIR-GAS ranged from moderate to excellent. The value of a broader use of tools such as the DC: 0-3R to promote early identification of families at risk for infant and toddler abuse and neglect is discussed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Results of assisted reproductive techniques from treatments initiated in Europe during 2005 are presented in this ninth report. Data were mainly collected from existing national registers. METHODS: From 30 countries, 923 clinics reported 418 111 treatment cycles including: IVF (118 074), ICSI (203 329), frozen embryo replacement (79 140), oocyte donation (ED, 11 475), preimplantation genetic diagnosis/screening (5846) and in vitro maturation (247). Overall, this represents a 13.6% increase since 2004, partly due to inclusion of 28 417 cycles from Turkey. European data on intrauterine insemination using husband/partner's semen (IUI-H) and donor semen (IUI-D) were reported from 21 countries and included 128 908 IUI-H and 20 568 IUI-D cycles. RESULTS: In 16 countries where all clinics reported to the IVF register, 1115 cycles were performed per million inhabitants. For IVF, the clinical pregnancy rates per aspiration and per transfer were 26.9% and 30.3%, respectively. For ICSI, the corresponding rates were 28.5% and 30.9%. After IUI-H, the clinical pregnancy rate was 12.6% per insemination in women <40. After IVF and ICSI, the distribution of transfer of one, two, three and four or more embryos was 20.0%, 56.1%, 21.5% and 2.3%, respectively. Huge differences exist between countries. The distribution of singleton, twin and triplet deliveries after IVF and ICSI was 78.2%, 21.0% and 0.8%, respectively. This gives a total multiple delivery rate of 21.8% compared with 22.7% in 2004 and 23.1% in 2003. In women <40 years of age, IUI-H was associated with a twin and triplet pregnancy rate of 11.0% and 1.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with earlier years, there was an increase in the reported number of ART cycles in Europe. Although fewer embryos were transferred per treatment, there was a marginal increase in pregnancy rates and a reduction in multiple deliveries.",

        "abstract": "The potential health effects of exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) remain largely unexplored. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is activated by collagens, upregulated in injured and fibrotic kidneys, and contributes to fibrosis by regulating extracellular matrix production, but how DDR1 controls fibrosis is poorly understood. DDR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). RTKs can translocate to the nucleus  METHODS: To determine whether DDR1 translocates to the nucleus and whether this event is mediated by collagen-induced DDR1 activation, we generated renal cells expressing wild-type or mutant forms of DDR1 no longer able to bind collagen. Then, we determined the location of the DDR1 upon collagen stimulation. Using both biochemical assays and immunofluorescence, we analyzed the steps involved in DDR1 nuclear translocation. RESULTS: We show that although DDR1 and its natural ligand, collagen, lack an NLS, DDR1 is present in the nucleus of injured human and mouse kidney proximal tubules. We show that DDR1 nuclear translocation requires collagen-mediated receptor activation and interaction of DDR1 with SEC61B, a component of the Sec61 translocon, and nonmuscle myosin IIA and  CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a novel mechanism whereby activated DDR1 translates to the nucleus to regulate synthesis of profibrotic molecules.",

The aim of the study was to compare the metabolic profiles of plasma and urine samples collected at birth from preterm neonates with and without earlyonset sepsis (EOS) to identify metabolic perturbations that might orient the search for new early biomarkers. All preterm newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were eligible for this proof-of-concept, prospective case-control study. Infants were enrolled as \"cases\" if they developed EOS, and as \"controls\"if they did not. Plasma samples collected at birth and urine samples collected within 24 h of birth underwent untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis using mass spectrometry coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Of 123 eligible newborns, 15 developed EOS. These 15 newborns matched controls for gestational age and weight. Metabolomic analysis revealed evident clustering of the cases versus controls, with the glutathione and tryptophan metabolic pathways markedly disrupted in the former. In conclusion, neonates with EOS had a metabolic profile at birth that clearly distinguished them from those without sepsis, and metabolites of glutathione and tryptophan pathways are promising as new biomarkers of neonatal sepsis.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To analyse the clinical value of procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and leucocyte count in the diagnosis of paediatric sepsis and in the stratification of patients according to severity. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). PATIENTS: Ninety-four children. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Leucocyte count, PCT and CRP were measured when considered necessary during the PICU stay. Patients were classified, when PCT and CRP were measured, into one of six categories (negative, SIRS, localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock) according to the definitions of the American College of Chest Physicians /Society of Critical Care Medicine. A total of 359 patient day episodes were obtained. Leucocyte count did not differ across the six diagnostic classes considered. Median plasma PCT concentrations were 0.17, 0.43, 0.79, 1.80, 15.40 and 19.13 ng/ml in negative, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock groups, respectively, whereas median plasma CRP concentrations were 1.35, 3.80, 6.45, 5.70, 7.60 and 16.2 mg/dl, respectively. The area under the ROC curve for the diagnosis of septic patients was 0.532 for leucocyte count (95% CI, 0.462-0.602), 0.750 for CRP (95% CI, 0.699-0.802) and 0.912 for PCT (95% CI, 0.882-0.943). We obtained four groups using CRP values and five groups using PCT values that classified a significant percentage of patients according to the severity of the different SIRS groups. CONCLUSIONS: PCT is a better diagnostic marker of sepsis in critically ill children than CRP. The CRP, and especially PCT, may become a helpful clinical tool to stratify patients with SIRS according to disease severity.",

        "abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotides, which are used to silence target genes, are gaining attention as a novel drug discovery modality for proteinopathies. However, while clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been conducted in recent years, the results have not always been favorable. The results from a Phase III trial of the antisense oligonucleotide, that is, tofersen, which targets SOD1 mRNA, showed decreased levels of cerebrospinal fluid SOD1 and plasma neurofilament light chain but no improvements in primary clinical endpoint. Moreover, case reports pertaining to patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis carrying FUS and C9orf72 mutations who received antisense oligonucleotide-based treatments have demonstrated a notable reduction in the targeted protein (thus providing the proof of mechanism) but with no discernible clinical benefits. There are several possible reasons why antisense oligonucleotides knockdown fails to achieve proof of concept, which need to be addressed: on-target adverse effects resulting from the loss of function of target gene and irreversible neuronal death cascade due to toxic protein accumulation, among other factors. This review provides an overview of the current status and discusses the prospects of antisense oligonucleotides treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

        "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an idiopathic disease of the nervous system characterized by progressive tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. It has been postulated that exogenous toxicants, including pesticides, might be involved in the etiology of PD. In this article we present a comprehensive review of the published epidemiologic and toxicologic literature and critically evaluate whether a relationship exists between pesticide exposure and PD. From the epidemiologic literature, there does appear to be a relatively consistent relationship between pesticide exposure and PD. This relationship appears strongest for exposure to herbicides and insecticides, and after long durations of exposure. Toxicologic data suggest that paraquat and rotenone may have neurotoxic actions that potentially play a role in the development of PD, with limited data for other pesticides. However, both the epidemiology and toxicology studies were limited by methodologic weaknesses. Particular issues of current and future interest include multiple exposures (both pesticides and other exogenous toxicants), developmental exposures, and gene-environment interactions. At present, the weight of evidence is sufficient to conclude that a generic association between pesticide exposure and PD exists but is insufficient for concluding that this is a causal relationship or that such a relationship exists for any particular pesticide compound or combined pesticide and other exogenous toxicant exposure.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Condoms and vasectomy are male-controlled family planning methods but suffer from limitations in compliance (condoms) and limited reversibility (vasectomy); thus many couples desire other options. Hormonal male contraceptive methods have undergone extensive clinical trials in healthy men and shown to be efficacious, reversible and appear to be well tolerated. RECENT FINDINGS: The success rate of male hormonal contraception using injectable testosterone alone is high and comparable to methods for women. Addition of progestins to androgens improved the rate of suppression of spermatogenesis. Supported by government or nongovernment organizations, current studies aim to find the best combination of testosterone and progestins for effective spermatogenesis suppression and to explore other delivery methods for these hormones. Translation of these advances to widespread use in the developed world will need the manufacturing and marketing skills of the pharmaceutical industry. Availability of male contraceptives to the developing world may require commitments of governmental and nongovernmental agencies. In a time when imbalance of basic resources and population needs are obvious, this may prove to be a very wise investment. SUMMARY: Male hormonal contraception is efficacious, reversible and well tolerated for the target population of younger men in stable relationships. Suppression of spermatogenesis is achieved with a combination of an androgen and a progestin. Partnership with industry will accelerate the marketing of a male hormonal contraceptive. Research is ongoing on selective androgen and progesterone receptor modulators that suppress spermatogenesis, minimize potential adverse events while retaining the androgenic and gonadotropin suppressive actions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mental health problems and risk behaviours among young people are of great public health concern. Consequently, within the VII Framework Programme, the European Commission funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in eleven European countries, with Sweden as the coordinating centre, and was designed to identify an effective way to promote mental health and reduce suicidality and risk taking behaviours among adolescents. OBJECTIVE: To describe the methodological and field procedures in the SEYLE RCT among adolescents, as well as to present the main characteristics of the recruited sample. METHODS: Analyses were conducted to determine: 1) representativeness of study sites compared to respective national data; 2) response rate of schools and pupils, drop-out rates from baseline to 3 and 12 month follow-up, 3) comparability of samples among the four Intervention Arms; 4) properties of the standard scales employed: Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), World Health Organization Well-Being Scale (WHO-5). RESULTS: Participants at baseline comprised 12,395 adolescents (M/F: 5,529/6,799; mean age=14.9\u00b10.9) from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. At the 3 and 12 months follow up, participation rates were 87.3% and 79.4%, respectively. Demographic characteristics of participating sites were found to be reasonably representative of their respective national population. Overall response rate of schools was 67.8%. All scales utilised in the study had good to very good internal reliability, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (BDI-II: 0.864; Z-SAS: 0.805; SDQ: 0.740; WHO-5: 0.799). CONCLUSIONS: SEYLE achieved its objective of recruiting a large representative sample of adolescents within participating European countries. Analysis of SEYLE data will shed light on the effectiveness of important interventions aimed at improving adolescent mental health and well-being, reducing risk-taking and self-destructive behaviour and preventing suicidality.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors. METHODS AND DESIGN: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes. DISCUSSION: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is unmet need for male contraceptive options, but a recent injectable combination male contraceptive trial was terminated early due to adverse events (AEs). METHODS: We examined the frequency of reported AEs by male research participants compared with AEs reported in prescribing information of approved female hormonal contraceptive methods. Published data from trials of the top five most-used female hormonal contraceptives, supplemented by contemporary contraceptive research, were compared with the frequency of AEs reported in a male injectable hormonal contraceptive trial. RESULTS: We observed similar frequencies of AEs reported by users of male contraceptives compared with those reported by female users. Among quantitatively comparable AEs, compared with men, women reported experiencing higher frequencies of headaches, pelvic pain, and weight gain and similar frequencies of decreased libido. Compared with women, men reported experiencing higher frequencies of acne and mood changes. Men discontinued participation due to AEs at a lower frequency than women. CONCLUSIONS: Female hormonal methods generally have similar frequencies of AEs to those reported in a recent male hormonal contraceptive trial, and male users had lower rates of discontinuation due to AEs. There were fewer serious AEs of the male contraceptive than reported in contemporary female trials which resulted in FDA licensure. This suggests there may be implicit bias in the scientific community regarding the level of acceptable risk for users of male contraceptive methods.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Male hormonal contraception has been an elusive goal. Administration of sex steroids to men can shut off sperm production through effects on the pituitary and hypothalamus. However, this approach also decreases production of testosterone, so \"add-back\" therapy is needed. OBJECTIVES: To summarize all randomized controlled trials of male hormonal contraception. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the computerized databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Popline, and LILACS (each from inception to February, 2003) for randomized controlled trials of hormonal contraception in men. We wrote to authors of identified trials to seek unpublished or published trials that we might have missed. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized controlled trials in any language that compared a steroid hormone with another contraceptive. We excluded non-steroidal male contraceptives, such as gossypol. We included both placebo and active-regimen control groups. All trials identified included only healthy men with normal semen analyses. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Azoospermia (absence of spermatozoa on semen examination) was the primary outcome measure. Data were insufficient to examine pregnancy rates and side effects. MAIN RESULTS: The proportion of men who achieved azoospermia varied widely in reports to date. Few significant differences emerged from these trials. Levonorgestrel implants combined with injectable testosterone enanthate (100 mg IM) was significantly more effective than was levonorgestrel 125 mcg by mouth daily combined with testosterone patches (10 mg/d) (OR for azoospermia with the oral levonorgestrel regimen 0.03; 95%CI 0.00-0.29). The addition of levonorgestrel 500 mcg by mouth daily improved the effectiveness of testosterone enanthate 100 mg IM weekly by itself (OR for azoospermia with the combined regimen 4.0; 95%CI 1.00-15.99). Several regimens, including testosterone alone and GnRH agonists and antagonists, had disappointing results. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: No male hormonal contraceptive is ready for clinical use. All trials published to date have been small exploratory studies. As a result, their power to detect important differences has been limited and their results imprecise. In addition, the definition of oligospermia has been imprecise or inconsistent in many reports. To avoid bias, future trials need more attention to the methodological requirements for randomized controlled trials. Trials with adequate power would also be helpful.",

Cannabis can be administered by smoking a plant-derived cigarette or by oral or intravenous administration of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive chemical in cannabis. The smoked route is most commonly used outside the laboratory, but is subject to wide variation in absorbed dose. Oral synthetic THC is a legally marketed medication (dronabinol), also subject to wide pharmacokinetic variation, but offering a greater safety margin because of slower onset of action and lower potency. Intravenous THC offers precise investigator control of dose and timing. Acute adverse effects of cannabis administration include tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, pulmonary irritation (if smoked), motor incoordination, cognitive impairment, anxiety, paranoia, and psychosis. Screening of research subjects should identify and exclude those with risk factors for such events, e.g., a history of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, or psychiatric disorders.

The sample consisted of 115 dyads with children's ages ranging from 1 to 47 months. Sixty-four dyads were recruited from community settings without known violence problems, and 51 dyads were recruited from clinical settings and already had been identified with violence problems or as being at risk for violence problems. To classify the dyads on the PIR-GAS categories, caregiver-child interactions were video-recorded and coded with observational scales appropriate for child age. To test whether the PIR-GAS allows for reliable identification of dyads with abusive relationship patterns, PIR-GAS ratings were compared with scores on the the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect's (ISPCAN) Child Abuse Screening Tool-Parental Version (ICAST-P; D.K. Runyan et\u00a0al., ), a questionnaire measuring abusive parental disciplinary practices. It was found that PIR-GAS ratings differentiated between the general and the clinical sample, and the dyads with abusive patterns of relationship were identified by both the PIR-GAS and the ICAST-P. Interrater reliability for the PIR-GAS ranged from moderate to excellent. The value of a broader use of tools such as the DC: 0-3R to promote early identification of families at risk for infant and toddler abuse and neglect is discussed.",

To prevent adverse psychosocial outcomes in young carers (YCs), primary prevention resilience building interventions have been recommended. We describe the study protocol of an international randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an innovative group intervention designed to promote the mental health and well-being of adolescent YCs (AYCs) aged 15-17. The RCT will be conducted in six European countries in the context of the Horizon 2020 European funded research and innovation project \"Psychosocial support for promoting mental health and well-being among adolescent young caregivers in Europe\" (\"ME-WE\"). The ME-WE intervention is based on Hayes and Ciarrochi's psychoeducational model for adolescents and will consist of seven 2-h sessions in a group format, aimed to help AYCs build psychological flexibility and live according to their values. The control group will be a waitlist. Primary and secondary outcomes and control variables will be measured at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and 3 months follow-up (T2). The COVID-19 pandemic has made amendments necessary to the original study protocol methodology, which we describe in detail. This study will contribute to building an evidence-based manualized program that educators and health and social care professionals can use to support AYCs in their transition to adulthood. From a research perspective, the outcomes of this study will contribute to evidence-based practices in primary prevention of psychosocial difficulties in AYCs and will gather novel knowledge on the effectiveness of Hayes and Ciarrochi's model for use with middle adolescents with caring responsibilities.

        "title": "[Vulnerability to depression in children and adolescents: update and perspectives].",
        "abstract": "Depression in children and adolescents is associated with poor psychosocial functioning, high psychiatric comorbidity, risk of recurrent episodes or onset of bipolar disorder. These findings emphasize the importance of early identification of children and adolescents having elevated risk for future depression and further development, evaluation and greater availability of prevention strategies. Our review aims an update about depressive vulnerability in children and adolescents in the perspective of better identification of at-risk populations and targeting of prevention programs. Psychopathology, in particular anxiety and disruptive disorders are well identified risk-factors for later depression. Subclinical depressive symptomatology, also termed \"demoralization\", also identifies high-risk populations, likely to become incident cases of depression. It is still unclear whether this condition is prodromal depression, a specific clinical entity or the expression of biological and/or cognitive vulnerability. Familial risk for depressive disorders involves both genetic and psychosocial factors. Marital discord, poor communication and dysfunctional parenting practices are often present in families with affective disorders and can be implicated in increased depressive vulnerability in the offspring. Research on individual vulnerability in children and adolescents has focused on temperamental and cognitive characteristics. Temperament traits describe individual differences in reactivity and behavior. High emotionality, defined as the tendency to become upset easily and intensely has been associated with an increased risk for subsequent major depression. However, as the majority of high scorers will not become depressive cases, emotionality should not be the only criterion for selection of at-risk populations. Cognitive style including poor self esteem, low social competence and negative attributions are also associated with increased likelihood of depressive symptoms, but their predictive value for the onset of clinical depressive episodes needs further investigation. Familial and individual vulnerability is likely to heighten the depressogenic impact of life events and psycho-social adversity. Prevention interventions have been developed in the United States for children and adolescents at-risk for depression. In France, clinicians witness growing demands from families with affective illness concerned with risk of parent-child transmission of depressive vulnerability, prevention and early identification of symptoms. To meet this kind of emerging needs and to prevent family dysfunction, a preventive program targets offspring of depressed parents and uses clinician-based family approaches. Family and individual sessions aim a better understanding of illness experience and encourage the parents to identify and foster resilience in their children. Another type of preventive intervention focuses on children and adolescents with subclinical depressive symptoms, eventually associated with behavioral problems ou high level of parental conflict, recruited in school settings. These school-based interventions combine cognitive and social problem-solving techniques. Both familial and school-based preventive interventions have proven applicable and promising in high-risk children and adolescents. Perspectives are more systematic identification of risk groups, including youngsters with past or current non affective symptoms who might benefit from depression prevention, long-term evaluation and cross-cultural applications of prevention programs.",

        "title": "Modifying effects of prenatal exposure to rare earth elements on birth outcomes through maternal thyroid function in early pregnancy.",
        "abstract": "The potential health effects of exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) remain largely unexplored. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotides, which are used to silence target genes, are gaining attention as a novel drug discovery modality for proteinopathies. However, while clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been conducted in recent years, the results have not always been favorable. The results from a Phase III trial of the antisense oligonucleotide, that is, tofersen, which targets SOD1 mRNA, showed decreased levels of cerebrospinal fluid SOD1 and plasma neurofilament light chain but no improvements in primary clinical endpoint. Moreover, case reports pertaining to patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis carrying FUS and C9orf72 mutations who received antisense oligonucleotide-based treatments have demonstrated a notable reduction in the targeted protein (thus providing the proof of mechanism) but with no discernible clinical benefits. There are several possible reasons why antisense oligonucleotides knockdown fails to achieve proof of concept, which need to be addressed: on-target adverse effects resulting from the loss of function of target gene and irreversible neuronal death cascade due to toxic protein accumulation, among other factors. This review provides an overview of the current status and discusses the prospects of antisense oligonucleotides treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is unmet need for male contraceptive options, but a recent injectable combination male contraceptive trial was terminated early due to adverse events (AEs). METHODS: We examined the frequency of reported AEs by male research participants compared with AEs reported in prescribing information of approved female hormonal contraceptive methods. Published data from trials of the top five most-used female hormonal contraceptives, supplemented by contemporary contraceptive research, were compared with the frequency of AEs reported in a male injectable hormonal contraceptive trial. RESULTS: We observed similar frequencies of AEs reported by users of male contraceptives compared with those reported by female users. Among quantitatively comparable AEs, compared with men, women reported experiencing higher frequencies of headaches, pelvic pain, and weight gain and similar frequencies of decreased libido. Compared with women, men reported experiencing higher frequencies of acne and mood changes. Men discontinued participation due to AEs at a lower frequency than women. CONCLUSIONS: Female hormonal methods generally have similar frequencies of AEs to those reported in a recent male hormonal contraceptive trial, and male users had lower rates of discontinuation due to AEs. There were fewer serious AEs of the male contraceptive than reported in contemporary female trials which resulted in FDA licensure. This suggests there may be implicit bias in the scientific community regarding the level of acceptable risk for users of male contraceptive methods.",

        "abstract": "It is estimated that 4-8% of youth in Europe carry out substantial care for a family member or significant other. To prevent adverse psychosocial outcomes in young carers (YCs), primary prevention resilience building interventions have been recommended. We describe the study protocol of an international randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an innovative group intervention designed to promote the mental health and well-being of adolescent YCs (AYCs) aged 15-17. The RCT will be conducted in six European countries in the context of the Horizon 2020 European funded research and innovation project \"Psychosocial support for promoting mental health and well-being among adolescent young caregivers in Europe\" (\"ME-WE\"). The ME-WE intervention is based on Hayes and Ciarrochi's psychoeducational model for adolescents and will consist of seven 2-h sessions in a group format, aimed to help AYCs build psychological flexibility and live according to their values. The control group will be a waitlist. Primary and secondary outcomes and control variables will be measured at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and 3 months follow-up (T2). The COVID-19 pandemic has made amendments necessary to the original study protocol methodology, which we describe in detail. This study will contribute to building an evidence-based manualized program that educators and health and social care professionals can use to support AYCs in their transition to adulthood. From a research perspective, the outcomes of this study will contribute to evidence-based practices in primary prevention of psychosocial difficulties in AYCs and will gather novel knowledge on the effectiveness of Hayes and Ciarrochi's model for use with middle adolescents with caring responsibilities. The trial has been preregistered (registration number: NCT04114864).",

The aim of the study was to compare the metabolic profiles of plasma and urine samples collected at birth from preterm neonates with and without earlyonset sepsis (EOS) to identify metabolic perturbations that might orient the search for new early biomarkers. All preterm newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were eligible for this proof-of-concept, prospective case-control study. Infants were enrolled as \"cases\" if they developed EOS, and as \"controls\"if they did not. Plasma samples collected at birth and urine samples collected within 24 h of birth underwent untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis using mass spectrometry coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Of 123 eligible newborns, 15 developed EOS. These 15 newborns matched controls for gestational age and weight. Metabolomic analysis revealed evident clustering of the cases versus controls, with the glutathione and tryptophan metabolic pathways markedly disrupted in the former. In conclusion, neonates with EOS had a metabolic profile at birth that clearly distinguished them from those without sepsis, and metabolites of glutathione and tryptophan pathways are promising as new biomarkers of neonatal sepsis.",

DDR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). RTKs can translocate to the nucleus  METHODS: To determine whether DDR1 translocates to the nucleus and whether this event is mediated by collagen-induced DDR1 activation, we generated renal cells expressing wild-type or mutant forms of DDR1 no longer able to bind collagen. Then, we determined the location of the DDR1 upon collagen stimulation. Using both biochemical assays and immunofluorescence, we analyzed the steps involved in DDR1 nuclear translocation. RESULTS: We show that although DDR1 and its natural ligand, collagen, lack an NLS, DDR1 is present in the nucleus of injured human and mouse kidney proximal tubules. We show that DDR1 nuclear translocation requires collagen-mediated receptor activation and interaction of DDR1 with SEC61B, a component of the Sec61 translocon, and nonmuscle myosin IIA and  CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a novel mechanism whereby activated DDR1 translates to the nucleus to regulate synthesis of profibrotic molecules.",

The sample consisted of 115 dyads with children's ages ranging from 1 to 47 months. Sixty-four dyads were recruited from community settings without known violence problems, and 51 dyads were recruited from clinical settings and already had been identified with violence problems or as being at risk for violence problems. To classify the dyads on the PIR-GAS categories, caregiver-child interactions were video-recorded and coded with observational scales appropriate for child age. To test whether the PIR-GAS allows for reliable identification of dyads with abusive relationship patterns, PIR-GAS ratings were compared with scores on the the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect's (ISPCAN) Child Abuse Screening Tool-Parental Version (ICAST-P; D.K. Runyan et\u00a0al., ), a questionnaire measuring abusive parental disciplinary practices. It was found that PIR-GAS ratings differentiated between the general and the clinical sample, and the dyads with abusive patterns of relationship were identified by both the PIR-GAS and the ICAST-P. Interrater reliability for the PIR-GAS ranged from moderate to excellent. The value of a broader use of tools such as the DC: 0-3R to promote early identification of families at risk for infant and toddler abuse and neglect is discussed.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Frozen shoulder (FS) is one of the most challenging shoulder disorders for patients and clinicians. Its symptoms mainly include any combination of stiffness, nocturnal pain, and limitation of active and passive glenohumeral joint movement. Conventional treatment options for FS are physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, injection therapy, and arthroscopic capsular release, but adverse and limited effects continue to present problems. As a result, pharmacoacupuncture (PA) is getting attention as an alternative therapy for patients with FS. PA is a new form of acupuncture treatment in traditional Korean medicine (TKM) that is mainly used for musculoskeletal diseases. It has similarity and specificity compared to corticosteroid injection and hydrodilatation, making it a potential alternative injection therapy for FS. However, no systematic reviews investigating the utilization of PA for FS have been published. Therefore, this review aims to standardize the clinical use of PA for FS and validate its therapeutic effect. METHODS: The protocol was registered in Prospero (CRD42023445708) on 18 July 2023. Until Aug. 31, 2023, seven electronic databases will be searched for randomized controlled trials of PA for FS. Authors will be contacted, and manual searches will also be performed. Two reviewers will independently screen and collect data from retrieved articles according to predefined criteria. The primary outcome will be pain intensity, and secondary outcomes will be effective rate, Constant-Murley Score, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index, range of motion, quality of life, and adverse events. Bias and quality of the included trials will be assessed using the Cochrane handbook's risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. Meta analyses will be conducted using Review Manager V.5.3 software. GRADE will be used to evaluate the level of evidence for each outcome. RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted following PRISMA statement. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: This review will provide scientific evidence to support health insurance policy as well as the standardization of PA in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Lecanemab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against human soluble amyloid-\u03b2 aggregates. It was developed for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease). Among the amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) involved in Alzheimer's disease, Lecanemab selectively binds to the highly neurotoxic A\u03b2 protofibrils, and is thought to reduce A\u03b2 protofibrils and amyloid plaques (A\u03b2 plaques) in the brain. The efficacy and safety of Lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease were investigated in an international Phase II placebo-controlled study (Study 201) and an international Phase III placebo-controlled study (Study 301). Both studies included Japanese subjects. Lecanemab was given accelerated approval in the United States in January 2023, followed by traditional approval in July 2023. In Japan, it was approved for \"control of the progression of mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease\" in September 2023, and was added to the NHI drug price list in December 2023.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease and is the most common cause of dementia. Lecanemab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid protofibrils for the treatment of early AD. In the phase II BAN2401-G000-201 trial (NCT01767311), lecanemab reduced amyloid accumulated in the brain and slowed progression on key global and cognitive scales evaluating efficacy after 18\u00a0months of treatment. METHODS: A disease simulation model was used to predict the long-term clinical outcomes of lecanemab for patients with early AD [i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and mild AD dementia] on the basis of BAN2401-G000-201 trial data and published literature. The model captures the pathophysiology and management of AD, with a focus on simulating the effects of disease modification and early intervention on disease progression. The model compares lecanemab in addition to standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone. RESULTS: Lecanemab treatment was estimated to slow the rate of disease progression, resulting in an extended duration of MCI due to AD and mild AD dementia and shortened duration in moderate and severe AD dementia. The mean time to mild, moderate, and severe AD dementia was longer for patients in the lecanemab\u2009+\u2009SoC group than for patients in the SoC group by 2.51, 3.13, and 2.34\u00a0years, respectively. On base-case analysis, lecanemab was associated with 0.73 incremental life years (LY) and 0.75 incremental quality-adjusted LYs (QALY), and the caregiver QALYs lost was reduced by 0.03\u00a0years. The model also predicted a lower lifetime probability of admission to institutional care in lecanemab\u2009+\u2009SoC versus SoC group (25% versus 31%). CONCLUSION: The model results demonstrate the potential clinical value of lecanemab for patients with early AD and how it can slow the rate of disease progression and reduce the lifetime probability for institutionalized care.",

Autologous bone marrow stem cells may be a better cell source and have been studied for the treatment of cerebral palsy because of their functions in tissue repair and the regulation of immunological processes. METHODS: To assess autologous marrow stem cells as a novel treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe cerebral palsy, a total of 10 cerebral palsy patients were enrolled in this clinical study with 24 months follow-up. A total of 10 cerebral palsy patients received autologous bone marrow cells transplantation (4.5 \u00d7 10 RESULTS: We recorded the gross motor function measurement scores, manual ability function measurement score, and adverse events up to 24 months post-treatment. The gross motor function measurement scores were significantly higher at month 6 post-treatment compared with the baseline scores and were stable up to 24 months follow-up. The increase in manual ability and communication function measurement scores at 6 months were not significant when compared to the baseline score. All the 10 patients survived and none of the patients experienced any serious adverse events or complications. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that bone marrow derived MNCs are safe and effective for the treatment of motor deficits related to cerebral palsy. Further randomized clinical trials are necessary to establish the efficacy of this procedure.",

The aim of this article is to<br />describe the protocol and results for altruistic embryo donation of the only embryo bank in the Netherlands.<br />Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive study. Since 2011, donated cryo-embryos from couples that have undergone<br />in vitro-fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) treatments, are being stored in our embryo<br />bank. The majority of the donated embryos were frozen on day 3 or 4 by slow freezing techniques.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Offspring of parents with major depressive disorder face a threefold higher risk for major depression than offspring without such family histories. Although major depression is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, neural correlates of risk for major depression remain poorly understood. This study compares amygdala and nucleus accumbens activation in children and adolescents at high and low risk for major depression under varying attentional and emotional conditions. METHOD: Thirty-nine juveniles, 17 offspring of parents with major depression (high-risk group) and 22 offspring of parents without histories of major depression, anxiety, or psychotic disorders (low-risk group) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. During imaging, subjects viewed faces that varied in intensity of emotional expressions across blocks of trials while attention was unconstrained (passive viewing) and constrained (rate nose width on face, rate subjective fear while viewing face). RESULTS: When attention was unconstrained, high-risk subjects showed greater amygdala and nucleus accumbens activation to fearful faces and lower nucleus accumbens activation to happy faces (small volume corrected for the amygdala and nucleus accumbens). No group differences emerged in amygdala or nucleus accumbens activation during constrained attention. Exploratory analysis showed that constraining attention was associated with greater medial prefrontal cortex activation in the high-risk than in the low-risk group. CONCLUSIONS: Amygdala and nucleus accumbens responses to affective stimuli may reflect vulnerability for major depression. Constraining attention may normalize emotion-related neural function possibly by engagement of the medial prefrontal cortex; face-viewing with unconstrained attention may engage aberrant processes associated with risk for major depression.",

        "abstract": "Although the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remains currently unknown, involvement of genetic factors is worldwide accepted as a key clue in the motor neuron death. Since 1993 and the discovery of mutation in the SOD1 gene, number of genes linked to or promoting ALS had always growing. Among them, only four (SOD1, TARDBP, FUS and C9ORF72 genes) are unanimously recognized as convincing causative genetic factors for more than 60% of familial and probably 10% of sporadic ALS cases. Geographic origin of the studied populations tends to become one of the major items in the gene-ALS relationship: this was extremely stressed for C9ORF72. Concerning susceptibility genes factors, an increase of the risk of ALS is clearly shown for SMN1 and ATXN2 genes and accepted for some VEGF haplotypes. Finally, some modulating effects might also exist as underline for the relationships between ApoE and ALS that differ between European and North American studies. In inherited ALS, The European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) edited rules that gave a legal frame to situations for which research of mutations were justified. Progress in the field of genetic raises major questions concerning the relevance of genetic studies from asymptomatic relatives. This first implies that the mutation identified in the proband case is perfectly characterized as a pathogenic mutation.",

DESIGN: Prospective clinical study of children with sepsis syndrome or septic shock. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS: 31 children with sepsis syndrome or septic shock. INTERVENTIONS: A tonometer was passed into the stomach via the orogastric route. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The following data were recorded at admission, 12, 24 and 48 h: heart rate, mean arterial pressure, arterial pH, base deficit, arterial lactate, gastric intramucosal pH (pHi) and DCO2 (intramucosal carbon dioxide tension minus arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide). The principal outcome measure was. The secondary outcome measure was the number of organ systems failing at 48 h after admission. There were 10 deaths and 21 survivors. No variable discriminated survival from death at presentation. Blood lactate level was the earliest discriminator of survival. Using univariate logistic regression, lactate discriminated survivors from those who died at 12 and 24 h after admission, but not at 48 h (p = 0.049, 0.044 and 0.062, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for lactate was 0.81, 0.88 and 0.89 at 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. At 12 h after admission, a blood lactate level > 3 mmol/l had a positive predictive value for death of 56% and a lactate level of 3 mmol/l or less had a positive predictive value for survival of 84%. At 24 h a lactate level > 3 mmol/l had a positive predictive value for death of 71% and a level of 3 mmol/l or less had a positive predictive value for survival of 86%. No other variable identified non-survivors from survivors at 12 h. Gastric tonometry could only be done on 19 of the 31 children, of whom 8 died and 11 survived. In these 19 children, DCO2 measured at 24 h, but not at 12 or 48 h, distinguished those who died from those who survived (p = 0.045 and p = 0.20, respectively). The area under the ROC curve for DCO2 measured at 24 h as a predictor of survival was 0.71. Neither the absolute value of pHi nor the trend of change in pHi at any time in the first 48 h identified survivors in this series. The mean arterial pressure distinguished survivors from non-survivors at 24 and 48 h (area under ROC curve = 0.80 and 0.78, respectively). The base deficit and heart rate did not identify non-survivors from survivors at any time in the first 48 h. CONCLUSIONS: Blood lactate level was the earliest predictor of outcome in children with sepsis. In this group of patients, gastric tonometry added little to the clinical information that could be derived more simply by other means.",

        "abstract": "Despite extensive research, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a progressive and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease. Limited knowledge of the underlying causes of ALS has made it difficult to target upstream biological mechanisms of disease, and therapeutic interventions are usually administered relatively late in the course of disease. Genetic forms of ALS offer a unique opportunity for therapeutic development, as genetic associations may reveal potential insights into disease etiology. Genetic ALS may also be amenable to investigating earlier intervention given the possibility of identifying clinically presymptomatic, at-risk individuals with causative genetic variants. There is increasing evidence for a presymptomatic phase of ALS, with biomarker data from the Pre-Symptomatic Familial ALS (Pre-fALS) study showing that an elevation in blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) precedes phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease. Tofersen is an investigational antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce synthesis of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein through degradation of SOD1 mRNA. Informed by Pre-fALS and the tofersen clinical development program, the ATLAS study (NCT04856982) is designed to evaluate the impact of initiating tofersen in presymptomatic carriers of SOD1 variants associated with high or complete penetrance and rapid disease progression who also have biomarker evidence of disease activity (elevated plasma NfL). The ATLAS study will investigate whether tofersen can delay the emergence of clinically manifest ALS. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first interventional trial in presymptomatic ALS and has the potential to yield important insights into the design and conduct of presymptomatic trials, identification, and monitoring of at-risk individuals, and future treatment paradigms in ALS.",

In the past years, myostatin inhibition sparked interest among the scientific community for its potential to enhance muscle growth and to reduce, or even prevent, muscle atrophy. These characteristics make it a promising target for the treatment of muscle atrophy in motor neuron diseases, namely, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which are rare neurological diseases, whereby the degeneration of motor neurons leads to progressive muscle loss and paralysis. These diseases carry a huge burden of morbidity and mortality but, despite this unfavorable scenario, several therapeutic advancements have been made in the past years. Indeed, a number of different curative therapies for SMA have been approved, leading to a revolution in the life expectancy and outcomes of SMA patients. Similarly, tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, is now undergoing clinical trial phase for use in ALS patients carrying the SOD1 mutation. However, these therapies are not able to completely halt or reverse progression of muscle damage. Recently, a trial evaluating apitegromab, a myostatin inhibitor, in SMA patients was started, following positive results from preclinical studies. In this context, myostatin inhibition could represent a useful strategy to tackle motor symptoms in these patients. The aim of this review is to describe the myostatin pathway and its role in motor neuron diseases, and to summarize and critically discuss preclinical and clinical studies of myostatin inhibitors in SMA and ALS. Then, we will highlight promises and pitfalls related to the use of myostatin inhibitors in the human setting, to aid the scientific community in the development of future clinical trials.",

Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a nonintegrin tyrosine kinase receptor for collagen implicated in cell adhesion, proliferation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. We have previously demonstrated that transgenic mice lacking DDR1 are protected from hypertension-associated renal fibrosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of DDR1 in renal inflammation and fibrosis related to primitive tubulointerstitial injury. After 12 days of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), kidney histopathologic and real-time quantitative PCR analyses were performed in DDR1(-/-) and wild-type mice. DDR1 expression was strongly increased in the obstructed kidney. Wild-type mice developed important perivascular and interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. In comparison, DDR1(-/-) mice displayed reduced accumulation of fibrillar collagen and transforming growth factor \u03b2 expression. F4/80(+) cell count and proinflammatory cytokines were remarkably blunted in DDR1(-/-) obstructed kidneys. Leukocyte rolling and adhesion evaluated by intravital microscopy were not different between DDR1(-/-) and wild-type mice. Importantly, macrophages isolated from DDR1(-/-) mice presented similar M1/M2 polarization but displayed impaired migration in response to monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Together, these data suggest that DDR1 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of renal disease via enhanced inflammation. Inhibition of DDR1 expression or activity may represent a novel therapeutic target against the progression of renal diseases.",

Using analytic morphomic measurements from computed tomography (CT) scans, we aimed to identify specific measures of body composition associated with PTDM. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 99 non-diabetic kidney transplant recipients who received pre-transplant CT scans at a single institution between 1/2005 and 5/2014. Analytic morphomic techniques were used to measure abdominal adiposity, abdominal size, and psoas muscle area and density, standardized by gender. We measured the associations of these morphomic factors with PTDM. RESULTS: One-year incidence of PTDM was 18%. The morphomic factors significantly associated with PTDM included visceral fat area (OR=1.84 per standard deviation increase, P=.020), body depth (OR=1.79, P=.035), and total body area (OR=1.67, P=.049). Clinical factors significantly associated with PTDM included African American race (OR=3.01, P=.044), hypertension (OR=2.97, P=.041), and dialysis vintage (OR=1.24 per year on dialysis, P=.048). Body mass index was not associated with PTDM (OR=1.05, P=.188). On multivariate modeling, visceral fat area was an independent predictor of PTDM (OR=1.91, P=.035). CONCLUSIONS: Analytic morphomics can identify pre-transplant measurements of body composition that are predictive of PTDM in kidney transplant recipients.

Clinical presentations of these disorders are often indistinguishable, hindering assessment and treatment. Despite substantial research identifying cognitive deficits, eye movement abnormalities and speech impairment associated with primary psychotic disorders, these neuropsychological features have not been explored as targets for diagnostic differentiation in early psychosis. METHODS: Eighteen participants with cannabis-induced psychosis (M RESULTS: Relative to individuals with primary psychosis, individuals with cannabis-induced psychosis demonstrated significantly better performance on the pro-saccade task, faster RT on pro- and anti-saccade tasks, better premorbid adjustment, and a higher degree of insight into their illness. There were no significant differences between groups on psychiatric symptoms, premorbid intellectual functioning, or problems related to cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS: In early stages of illness, reliance on traditional diagnostic tools or clinical interviews may be insufficient to distinguish between cannabis-induced and primary psychosis. Future research should continue to explore neuropsychological differences between these diagnoses to improve diagnostic accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Medical practitioners are, like the other health, education and childhood professionals, important actors of the language and learning disorders' screening. Six years old--the age at which children start the elementary school--is a key age for this screening. At the request of practitioners, a multidisciplinary staff had developed a screening tool: ERTLA6 (Epreuves de rep\u00e9rage des troubles du langage et des apprentissages de l'enfant de 6 ans). The objective was to validate the capacity of ERTLA6 to predict the school performance. A sample of 187 children was randomly constituted among the whole population of last year nursery school children in an area of France (the Acad\u00e9mie de Nancy-Metz). Those children, aged from 5 to 6, were screened with ERTLA6 by the school practitioner during a medical visit (score from 0 [the best] to 18 [the worse]). The School outcomes (considered as judgment criteria) were assessed 2 or 3 years later, after two years of elementary school. 148 children had completed their follow-up (the others: 27 moving house, 6 absents the day of evaluation, 2 missing data). Mean age was 5; 10 years. With a threshold > or = 7, ERTLA6 sensibility and specificity were respectively 79% [63-94] and 87% [81-93]; the positive predictive value was 58% [42-74], the negative predictive value was 95% [90-99]. The percentage of well classified children was 84% [69-99]. To our knowledge, ERTLA6 is the first validated tool in France for screening language and learning disorders which can be used by practitioners for the prediction of school outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition, occurring when an infectious agent invades the body, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2\u03bcg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin. Early detection of bacteria followed by antimicrobial susceptibility test can help by selection of appropriate antibiotic and prevent spread of infection.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of childhood mortality. Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

One of its severe effects is sub-fertility. The exact reason for endometriosis is still unknown and under investigation. Tracking the symptoms is not sufficient for diagnosing the disease. A successful diagnosis can only be made using laparoscopy. During the disease, the amount of some molecules (i.e., proteins, antigens) changes in the blood. Raman spectroscopy provides information about biochemicals without using dyes or external labels. In this study, Raman spectroscopy is used as a non-invasive diagnostic method for endometriosis. The Raman spectra of 94 serum samples acquired from 49 patients and 45 healthy individuals were compared for this study. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), k- Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used in the analysis. According to the results (using 80 measurements for training and 14 measurements for the test set), it was found that kNN-weighted gave the best classification model with sensitivity and specificity values of 80.5% and 89.7%, respectively. Testing the model with unseen data yielded a sensitivity value of 100% and a specificity value of 100%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which Raman spectroscopy was used in combination with PCA and classification algorithms as a non-invasive method applied on blood sera for the diagnosis of endometriosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In this 10th European IVF-monitoring (EIM) report, the results of assisted reproductive techniques from treatments initiated in Europe during 2006 are presented. Data were mainly collected from existing national registers. METHODS: From 32 countries, 998 clinics reported 458 759 treatment cycles including: IVF (117 318), ICSI (232 844), frozen embryo replacement (FER, 86 059), egg donation (ED, 12 685), preimplantation genetic diagnosis/screening (6561), in vitro maturation (247) and frozen oocytes replacements (3498). Overall this represents a 9.7% increase in activity since 2005, which is partly due to an increase in registers (seven more countries with complete coverage). European data on intrauterine insemination using husband/partner's (IUI-H) and donor (IUI-D) semen were reported from 22 countries. A total of 134 261 IUI-H and 24 339 IUI-D cycles were included. RESULTS: In 20 countries, where all clinics reported to the IVF register, a total of 359 110 assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles were performed in a population of 422.5 million, corresponding to 850 cycles per million inhabitants. For IVF, the clinical pregnancy rates per aspiration and per transfer were 29.0 and 32.4%, respectively. For ICSI, the corresponding rates were 29.9 and 33.0%. After IUI-H the delivery rate was 9.2% in women below 40. After IVF and ICSI the distribution of transfer of one, two, three and four or more embryos was 22.1, 57.3, 19.0 and 1.6%, respectively. Compared with 2005, fewer embryos were replaced per transfer, but significant national differences in practice were apparent. The proportion of singleton, twin and triplet deliveries after IVF and ICSI combined was 79.2, 19.9 and 0.9%, respectively. This gives a total multiple delivery rates of 20.8% compared with 21.8% in 2005 and 22.7% in 2004. IUI-H in women below 40 years of age resulted in 10.6% twin and 0.6% triplet pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous years, the reported number of ART cycles in Europe has increased, pregnancy rates have increased marginally, even though fewer embryos were transferred and the multiple delivery rates have declined.",

        "abstract": "Depression in children and adolescents is associated with poor psychosocial functioning, high psychiatric comorbidity, risk of recurrent episodes or onset of bipolar disorder. These findings emphasize the importance of early identification of children and adolescents having elevated risk for future depression and further development, evaluation and greater availability of prevention strategies. Our review aims an update about depressive vulnerability in children and adolescents in the perspective of better identification of at-risk populations and targeting of prevention programs. Psychopathology, in particular anxiety and disruptive disorders are well identified risk-factors for later depression. Subclinical depressive symptomatology, also termed \"demoralization\", also identifies high-risk populations, likely to become incident cases of depression. It is still unclear whether this condition is prodromal depression, a specific clinical entity or the expression of biological and/or cognitive vulnerability. Familial risk for depressive disorders involves both genetic and psychosocial factors. Marital discord, poor communication and dysfunctional parenting practices are often present in families with affective disorders and can be implicated in increased depressive vulnerability in the offspring. Research on individual vulnerability in children and adolescents has focused on temperamental and cognitive characteristics. Temperament traits describe individual differences in reactivity and behavior. High emotionality, defined as the tendency to become upset easily and intensely has been associated with an increased risk for subsequent major depression. However, as the majority of high scorers will not become depressive cases, emotionality should not be the only criterion for selection of at-risk populations. Cognitive style including poor self esteem, low social competence and negative attributions are also associated with increased likelihood of depressive symptoms, but their predictive value for the onset of clinical depressive episodes needs further investigation. Familial and individual vulnerability is likely to heighten the depressogenic impact of life events and psycho-social adversity. Prevention interventions have been developed in the United States for children and adolescents at-risk for depression. In France, clinicians witness growing demands from families with affective illness concerned with risk of parent-child transmission of depressive vulnerability, prevention and early identification of symptoms. To meet this kind of emerging needs and to prevent family dysfunction, a preventive program targets offspring of depressed parents and uses clinician-based family approaches. Family and individual sessions aim a better understanding of illness experience and encourage the parents to identify and foster resilience in their children. Another type of preventive intervention focuses on children and adolescents with subclinical depressive symptoms, eventually associated with behavioral problems ou high level of parental conflict, recruited in school settings. These school-based interventions combine cognitive and social problem-solving techniques. Both familial and school-based preventive interventions have proven applicable and promising in high-risk children and adolescents. Perspectives are more systematic identification of risk groups, including youngsters with past or current non affective symptoms who might benefit from depression prevention, long-term evaluation and cross-cultural applications of prevention programs.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: There is a lack of comprehensive information on the relationship between domestic physical and emotional violence and pregnancy outcomes. Accordingly, we undertook this systematic review of the literature to examine the evidence on the association between physical and emotional abuse and pregnancy outcomes. STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: A comprehensive literature search was carried out using pertinent key words that would retrieve any research article pertaining to the topic. This was supplemented by cross-referencing of the articles. A total of 296 articles were found; case reports and articles that failed to satisfy the study inclusion criteria were removed and 30 articles were included in the review. RESULTS: Overall, adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight, maternal mortality and infant mortality are significantly more likely among abused than nonabused mothers. Abused pregnant mothers present more often than nonabused mothers with kidney infections, gain less weight during pregnancy, and are more likely to undergo operative delivery. Fetal morbidity, such as low birth weight, preterm delivery, and small size for gestational age are more frequent among abused than nonabused gravidas. The risk for maternal mortality is three times as high for abused mothers. Black abused mothers are 3-4 times as likely to die as their white counterparts. Unmarried victims are also three times as likely to die as married abused mothers. Intimate partner violence is also responsible for increased fetal deaths in affected pregnancies (about 16.0 per 1000). CONCLUSION: Intimate partner violence is often a life-threatening event to both the mother and the fetus. This, in addition to the heightened level of feto-maternal morbidity and mortality, represents clear-cut justification for routine systematic screening for the presence of abuse during pregnancy.",

No significant differences in expression of neurotrophic factors were found between PBMCs and mPBMCs. However, in cerebral palsy children, the expression of interleukin-6 was significantly increased in mPBMCs as compared to PBMCs, and the expression of interleukin-3 was significantly decreased in mPBMCs as compared to PBMCs. In healthy adults, the expression levels of both interleukin-1\u03b2 and interleukin-6 were significantly increased in mPBMCs as compared to PBMCs. The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factors in mPBMC from cerebral palsy children was significantly higher than that in the cord blood or mPBMCs from healthy adults. The expression of G-CSF in mPBMCs from cerebral palsy children was comparable to that in the cord blood but significantly higher than that in mPBMCs from healthy adults. Lower expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-3, and -6) and higher expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-8 and interleukin-9) were observed from the cord blood and mPBMCs from cerebral palsy children rather than from healthy adults. These findings indicate that mPBMCs from cerebral palsy and cord blood mononuclear cells from healthy newborns have the potential to become seed cells for treatment of cerebral palsy.",

We argue that while the biological mechanisms underlying individual susceptibility to develop a psychotic disorder following heavy cannabis use are still unknown, heavy cannabis use remains the most modifiable risk factor for the onset of psychotic disorders and for its clinical and functional outcome.

CAR is manufactured to express T cells through various ways such as using retroviruses, transposons and transposase, electroporation, and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Together, it provides flexibility since it recognizes proteins without the need of antigen processing and presentation, can recognize carbohydrates and lipids, and it has been proven to be cost-effective. Despite these benefits however, problems faced by this therapy include unrecognized tumor proteins possibly escaping the system, CAR T cell expression being transient, and the therapy being one of the most expensive cancer drug ever approved. As a result, recent progress has been ongoing where researchers have combined CAR-T cells with natural killer (NK) cells and different cytokines to maximize its efficacy and potency while limiting potential risks such as cytokine release syndrome. Consequently, these cells gained the ability to be universal-being able to be used to treat multiple patients, maintain viability for a longer period, and prevent relapse.",

        "title": "A Path to Improved Alzheimer's Care: Simulating Long-Term Health Outcomes of Lecanemab in Early Alzheimer's Disease from the CLARITY AD Trial.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease, is the main cause of dementia and one of the leading causes of death for elderly people in the USA. Lecanemab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid protofibrils for the treatment of early AD [i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD dementia]. In a recent 18-month phase\u00a0III trial, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, lecanemab treatment led to reduced brain amyloid burden and significant improvements in cognitive and functional abilities in individuals with early AD. METHODS: An evidence-based patient-level disease simulation model was updated to estimate the long-term health outcomes of lecanemab plus standard of care (SoC) compared to SoC alone in patients with early AD and evidence of brain amyloid burden, using recent phase\u00a0III trial data and published literature. The disease progression is described by changes in the underlying biomarkers of AD, including measures of amyloid and tau, and their connection to the clinical presentation of the disease assessed through various patient-level scales of cognition and function. RESULTS: Lecanemab treatment was estimated to slow the progression of AD to moderate and severe stages and reduce the time spent in these more advanced states. In individuals with early AD, lecanemab plus SoC was associated with a gain of 0.71 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), a 2.95-year delay in mean time to progression to AD dementia, a reduction of 0.11\u00a0years in institutional care, and an additional 1.07\u00a0years in community care as shown in the base-case study. Improved health outcomes were demonstrated with lecanemab treatment when initiated earlier based on age, disease severity, or tau pathology, resulting in estimated gains in QALYs ranging from 0.77 to 1.09\u00a0years, compared to 0.4\u00a0years in the mild AD dementia subset, as shown by the model. CONCLUSION: The study findings demonstrate the potential clinical value of lecanemab for individuals with early AD by slowing down disease progression and prolonging time in earlier stages of disease, which significantly benefits not only patients and caregivers but also society overall.

        "title": "Predicting functional and quality-of-life outcomes following pediatric sepsis: performance of PRISM-III and PELOD-2.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Illness severity scores predict mortality following pediatric critical illness. Given declining PICU mortality, we assessed the ability of the Pediatric Risk of Mortality-III (PRISM) and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD) scores to predict morbidity outcomes. METHODS: Among 359 survivors <18 years in the Life After Pediatric Sepsis Evaluation multicenter prospective cohort study, we assessed functional morbidity at hospital discharge (Functional Status Scale increase \u22653 points from baseline) and health-related quality of life (HRQL; Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory or Functional Status II-R) deterioration >25% from baseline at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-admission. We determined discrimination of admission PRISM and admission, maximum, and cumulative 28-day PELOD with functional and HRQL morbidity at each timepoint. RESULTS: Cumulative PELOD provided the best discrimination of discharge functional morbidity (area under the receive operating characteristics curve [AUROC] 0.81, 95% CI 0.76-0.87) and 3-month HRQL deterioration (AUROC 0.71, 95% CI 0.61-0.81). Prediction was inferior for admission PRISM and PELOD and for 6- and 12-month HRQL assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Illness severity scores have a good prediction of early functional morbidity but a more limited ability to predict longer-term HRQL. Identification of factors beyond illness severity that contribute to HRQL outcomes may offer opportunities for intervention to improve outcomes. IMPACT: Illness severity scores are commonly used for mortality prediction and risk stratification in pediatric critical care research, quality improvement, and resource allocation algorithms. Prediction of morbidity rather than mortality may be beneficial given declining pediatric intensive care unit mortality. The PRISM and PELOD scores have moderate to good ability to predict new functional morbidity at hospital discharge following pediatric septic shock but limited ability to predict health-related quality of life outcomes in the year following PICU admission. Further research is needed to identify additional factors beyond illness severity that may impact post-discharge health-related quality of life.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most studies regarding late-onset sepsis (LOS) address selected populations (i.e., neonates with low birth weight or extremely preterm neonates). Studying all age groups is more suitable to assess the burden of single pathogens and their clinical relevance. METHODS: This is a retrospective regional study involving paediatric departments and NICUs in Emilia-Romagna (Italy). Regional laboratory databases were searched from 2009 to 2012. Records of infants (aged 4 to 90 days) with a positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture were retrospectively reviewed and analysed according to acquisition mode (whether hospital- or community-acquired). RESULTS: During the study period, there were 146,682 live births (LBs), with 296 patients experiencing 331 episodes of LOS (incidence rate: 2.3/1000 LBs). Brain lesions upon discharge from the hospital were found in 12.3% (40/296) of cases, with death occurring in 7.1% (23/296; 0.14/1000 LBs). With respect to full-term neonates, extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight neonates had very high risk of LOS and related mortality (> 100- and > 800-fold higher respectively). Hospital-acquired LOS (n = 209) was significantly associated with very low birth weight, extremely preterm birth, pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, and death (p< 0.01). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, catecholamine support (OR = 3.2), central venous line before LOS (OR = 14.9), and meningitis (OR = 44.7) were associated with brain lesions or death in hospital-acquired LOS (area under the ROC curve 0.81, H-L p = 0.41). Commonly identified pathogens included coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS n = 71, 21.4%), Escherichia coli (n = 50, 15.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 41, 12.4%) and Enterobacteriaceae (n = 41, 12.4%). Group B streptococcus was the predominant cause of meningitis (16 of 38 cases, 42%). Most pathogens were sensitive to first line antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first Italian data regarding late-onset sepsis (LOS) in all gestational age groups. Compared to full-term neonates, very high rates of LOS and mortality occurred in neonates with a lower birth weight and gestational age. Group B streptococcus was the leading cause of meningitis. Excluding CoNS, the predominant pathogens were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Neonates with hospital-acquired LOS had a worse outcome. Antibiotic associations, recommended for empirical treatment of hospital- or community-acquired LOS, were adequate.",

        "abstract": "Unconjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are an important component of effective combination therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) is a major mediator of mAb cytotoxicity, but there is limited knowledge of the determinants of ADP efficacy. We used macrophages derived in vitro from autologous circulating monocytes to test the effects of mAb structure and concentration, target : effector cell ratio, duration of co-incubation and CLL cell CD20 expression on ADP. Next-generation anti-CD20 mAbs (ofatumumab, ublituximab, obinutuzumab, ocaratuzumab) were significantly more effective at inducing ADP compared to rituximab, but none were as effective as the anti-CD52 mAb alemtuzumab. Ofatumumab (10 \u03bcg/ml) used as a representative next-generation anti-CD20 mAb achieved an ADP plateau at 3 h co-incubation with a target : effector ratio of 10 : 1 (mean = 2.1 CLL cells/macrophage, range = 1.5-3.5). At 0.156 \u03bcg/ml (the lowest concentration tested) ofatumumab ADP was significantly higher than alemtuzumab. However, ofatumumab-induced ADP did not increase significantly at higher mAb concentrations. We show that anti-CD20 mAb ADP efficacy is determined by the mAb characteristics, target : effector ratio and incubation time. We suggest that preclinical evaluation of anti-CD20\u2009mAbs to understand the determinants of ADP could be useful in designing future combination therapies for CLL.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B, a vaccine-preventable liver infection, remains a global public health problem. Dedicated groups of experts and funding are focusing on achieving a functional cure to eradicate this disease by 2030. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: With more than 40 molecules available or under investigation as new treatments for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, none of them is curative so far. Available treatments are effective in suppressing HBV replication and in decreasing the risk of developing cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death, but do not eliminate the virus, and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma remains. Nucleoside/nucleotide analogs are recommended as first-line therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B infection to inhibit viral replication and lower the HBV DNA values, but long-term therapy is usually needed to maintain suppression. Cessation of the therapy in accordance with clinical guidelines can result in virological and clinical relapse. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov , and gray literature sources were searched for articles discussing HBV management and new therapies. RESULTS: With current nucleoside/nucleotide analog therapies, fewer than 5% of patients lose hepatitis B surface antigen after 12 months, which underscores the need for new drugs that can achieve a functional cure. New therapies are being developed, including small interfering RNAs. Bepirovirsen, a modified antisense oligonucleotide, shows promising results and a good safety profile, but requires further exploration in larger number of patients to determine whether a functional cure is possible. CONCLUSIONS: Eradication of HBV infection with currently available therapies is not yet possible. Experts are developing innovative treatments, such as bepirovirsen, to achieve functional cure for this disease and to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.",

The aim of the study was to compare the metabolic profiles of plasma and urine samples collected at birth from preterm neonates with and without earlyonset sepsis (EOS) to identify metabolic perturbations that might orient the search for new early biomarkers. All preterm newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were eligible for this proof-of-concept, prospective case-control study. Infants were enrolled as \"cases\" if they developed EOS, and as \"controls\"if they did not. Plasma samples collected at birth and urine samples collected within 24 h of birth underwent untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis using mass spectrometry coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Of 123 eligible newborns, 15 developed EOS. These 15 newborns matched controls for gestational age and weight. Metabolomic analysis revealed evident clustering of the cases versus controls, with the glutathione and tryptophan metabolic pathways markedly disrupted in the former. In conclusion, neonates with EOS had a metabolic profile at birth that clearly distinguished them from those without sepsis, and metabolites of glutathione and tryptophan pathways are promising as new biomarkers of neonatal sepsis.",

Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to A\u03b2 soluble protofibrils, is being tested in persons with early Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We conducted an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial involving persons 50 to 90 years of age with early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) with evidence of amyloid on positron-emission tomography (PET) or by cerebrospinal fluid testing. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous lecanemab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline at 18 months in the score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). Key secondary end points were the change in amyloid burden on PET, the score on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90; higher scores indicate greater impairment), the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS; range, 0 to 1.97; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL; range, 0 to 53; lower scores indicate greater impairment). RESULTS: A total of 1795 participants were enrolled, with 898 assigned to receive lecanemab and 897 to receive placebo. The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, -0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.23; P<0.001). In a substudy involving 698 participants, there were greater reductions in brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo (difference, -59.1 centiloids; 95% CI, -62.6 to -55.6). Other mean differences between the two groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14 score, -1.44 (95% CI, -2.27 to -0.61; P<0.001); for the ADCOMS, -0.050 (95% CI, -0.074 to -0.027; P<0.001); and for the ADCS-MCI-ADL score, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001). Lecanemab resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions in 12.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Lecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events. Longer trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease. (Funded by Eisai and Biogen; Clarity AD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03887455.).",

The main objective is to characterize the emergency presentation of the IBI among children aged younger than 14 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective registry-based cohort study including all patients aged younger than 14 years diagnosed with confirmed IBI (culture or genomic detection using the polymerase chain reaction) was carried out in a paediatric emergency department between 2008 and 2015. Severity criteria were as follows: death, sequelae or admission to the ICU. RESULTS: Of the 223 IBIs reported, 187 (83.9%) corresponded to previously healthy patients (median age=19 months) and 165 (74%) were well appearing. The most common diagnoses were occult bacteraemia [60 (26.9%)] and sepsis [56 (25.1%)]. The most frequent pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae [68 (30.5%)] and Neisseria meningitidis [42 (18.8%)]. Four (1.8) patients died (S. pneumoniae, 2) and eight (3.5%) had sequelae (S. pneumoniae, 5). The diagnoses and clinical characteristics of the children varied significantly depending on the isolated pathogen. Duration of fever less than 24\u2009h, symptoms other than fever and not being well-appearing upon arrival to the emergency department were independent risk factors for greater severity (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve=0.805; 95% confidence interval: 0.741-0.868). CONCLUSION: IBIs are commonly diagnosed in previously healthy and well-appearing young children. S. pneumoniae was responsible for the majority of deaths or sequelae. Short duration of fever, symptoms other than fever and not being stable on arrival are associated with greater severity.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mortality from meningococcal disease typically occurs within 24 hrs of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. An early, accurate mortality-risk tool may aid in trial design for novel therapies. We assessed the performance of two generic scores that assign mortality risk within 1 hr of ICU admission: the Preintensive Care Pediatric Risk of Mortality (Pre-ICU PRISM) and Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM). DESIGN: Prospective, observational study over 21 months. SETTING: Two tertiary pediatric ICUs accepting referrals from southeast England. PATIENTS: Patients were 165 consecutive children with meningococcal disease. Ages ranged from 0.1 to 17 yrs (median 2.3 yrs). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PIM demonstrated greater sensibility, with complete data collected in 93% of cases, compared with 35% for the pre-ICU PRISM. Both scores discriminated well. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.00) for PIM and 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.88-0.98) for Pre-ICU PRISM; this did not change when applied to the subgroup of patients with complete data. Both scores calibrated poorly, overestimating mortality in the medium-risk strata (and also in the high-risk stratum in the case of Pre-ICU PRISM). When used as a stratification tool for a hypothetical trial (60% reduction in mortality, 80% power), the scores allowed for a reduction in study size by 50% (PIM) and 43% (pre-ICU PRISM). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-ICU PRISM and PIM both discriminate well but calibrate poorly when applied to a cohort of children with meningococcal sepsis. Both scores provide an effective means of stratification for clinical trial purposes. The main advantage for PIM appears to be ease of data collection.",

        "abstract": "Inhibitors of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (mIDH) 1 and 2 cancer-associated enzymes prevent the accumulation of the oncometabolite d-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and are under clinical investigation for the treatment of several cancers harboring an IDH mutation. Herein, we describe the discovery of vorasidenib (AG-881), a potent, oral, brain-penetrant dual inhibitor of both mIDH1 and mIDH2. X-ray cocrystal structures allowed us to characterize the compound binding site, leading to an understanding of the dual mutant inhibition. Furthermore, vorasidenib penetrates the brain of several preclinical species and inhibits 2-HG production in glioma tissue by >97% in an orthotopic glioma mouse model. Vorasidenib represents a novel dual mIDH1/2 inhibitor and is currently in clinical development for the treatment of low-grade mIDH glioma.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In this 10th European IVF-monitoring (EIM) report, the results of assisted reproductive techniques from treatments initiated in Europe during 2006 are presented. Data were mainly collected from existing national registers. METHODS: From 32 countries, 998 clinics reported 458 759 treatment cycles including: IVF (117 318), ICSI (232 844), frozen embryo replacement (FER, 86 059), egg donation (ED, 12 685), preimplantation genetic diagnosis/screening (6561), in vitro maturation (247) and frozen oocytes replacements (3498). Overall this represents a 9.7% increase in activity since 2005, which is partly due to an increase in registers (seven more countries with complete coverage). European data on intrauterine insemination using husband/partner's (IUI-H) and donor (IUI-D) semen were reported from 22 countries. A total of 134 261 IUI-H and 24 339 IUI-D cycles were included. RESULTS: In 20 countries, where all clinics reported to the IVF register, a total of 359 110 assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles were performed in a population of 422.5 million, corresponding to 850 cycles per million inhabitants. For IVF, the clinical pregnancy rates per aspiration and per transfer were 29.0 and 32.4%, respectively. For ICSI, the corresponding rates were 29.9 and 33.0%. After IUI-H the delivery rate was 9.2% in women below 40. After IVF and ICSI the distribution of transfer of one, two, three and four or more embryos was 22.1, 57.3, 19.0 and 1.6%, respectively. Compared with 2005, fewer embryos were replaced per transfer, but significant national differences in practice were apparent. The proportion of singleton, twin and triplet deliveries after IVF and ICSI combined was 79.2, 19.9 and 0.9%, respectively. This gives a total multiple delivery rates of 20.8% compared with 21.8% in 2005 and 22.7% in 2004. IUI-H in women below 40 years of age resulted in 10.6% twin and 0.6% triplet pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous years, the reported number of ART cycles in Europe has increased, pregnancy rates have increased marginally, even though fewer embryos were transferred and the multiple delivery rates have declined.",

The aim of this article is to<br />describe the protocol and results for altruistic embryo donation of the only embryo bank in the Netherlands.<br />Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive study. Since 2011, donated cryo-embryos from couples that have undergone<br />in vitro-fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) treatments, are being stored in our embryo<br />bank. The majority of the donated embryos were frozen on day 3 or 4 by slow freezing techniques. We perform a<br />thorough medical and psychological screening of donor couples and recipients, according to the protocol drawn up in<br />close collaboration with the Dutch Ministry of Health.<br />Results: Up to June 2021, 54 women have received embryos from our embryo bank, all single embryo transfers.<br />While the clinical pregnancy rate in 'unknown' embryo donations was relatively high (25.3%), the live birth rate<br />shows limited success (12.6%), partly due to high pregnancy loss through miscarriage. In known donation procedures,<br />the recipients tend to undergo more procedures, depending on the number of donated cryo-embryos. Twentyeight<br />women received embryos from known donors, with a clinical pregnancy rate per embryo transfer of 24%, and<br />live birth rate of 14%. In total, 82 recipients were granted donated cryo-embryos, twenty had an ongoing pregnancy<br />(24.4%), nineteen of whom have given birth to a healthy child (23%).<br />Conclusion: Altruistic embryo donation of embryos appears to be satisfying for the donors, as they are not obliged to destroy<br />their embryos, but instead help others build a family. Although success rates are still limited, partly due to the relatively high<br />miscarriage rates and inferior freezing techniques, to this date nineteen out of 82 recipients have given birth to a healthy child.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: There is a lack of comprehensive information on the relationship between domestic physical and emotional violence and pregnancy outcomes. Accordingly, we undertook this systematic review of the literature to examine the evidence on the association between physical and emotional abuse and pregnancy outcomes. STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: A comprehensive literature search was carried out using pertinent key words that would retrieve any research article pertaining to the topic. This was supplemented by cross-referencing of the articles. A total of 296 articles were found; case reports and articles that failed to satisfy the study inclusion criteria were removed and 30 articles were included in the review. RESULTS: Overall, adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight, maternal mortality and infant mortality are significantly more likely among abused than nonabused mothers. Abused pregnant mothers present more often than nonabused mothers with kidney infections, gain less weight during pregnancy, and are more likely to undergo operative delivery. Fetal morbidity, such as low birth weight, preterm delivery, and small size for gestational age are more frequent among abused than nonabused gravidas. The risk for maternal mortality is three times as high for abused mothers. Black abused mothers are 3-4 times as likely to die as their white counterparts. Unmarried victims are also three times as likely to die as married abused mothers. Intimate partner violence is also responsible for increased fetal deaths in affected pregnancies (about 16.0 per 1000). CONCLUSION: Intimate partner violence is often a life-threatening event to both the mother and the fetus. This, in addition to the heightened level of feto-maternal morbidity and mortality, represents clear-cut justification for routine systematic screening for the presence of abuse during pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Better risk assessment tools are needed to predict post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM). Using analytic morphomic measurements from computed tomography (CT) scans, we aimed to identify specific measures of body composition associated with PTDM. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 99 non-diabetic kidney transplant recipients who received pre-transplant CT scans at a single institution between 1/2005 and 5/2014. Analytic morphomic techniques were used to measure abdominal adiposity, abdominal size, and psoas muscle area and density, standardized by gender. We measured the associations of these morphomic factors with PTDM. RESULTS: One-year incidence of PTDM was 18%. The morphomic factors significantly associated with PTDM included visceral fat area (OR=1.84 per standard deviation increase, P=.020), body depth (OR=1.79, P=.035), and total body area (OR=1.67, P=.049). Clinical factors significantly associated with PTDM included African American race (OR=3.01, P=.044), hypertension (OR=2.97, P=.041), and dialysis vintage (OR=1.24 per year on dialysis, P=.048). Body mass index was not associated with PTDM (OR=1.05, P=.188). On multivariate modeling, visceral fat area was an independent predictor of PTDM (OR=1.91, P=.035). CONCLUSIONS: Analytic morphomics can identify pre-transplant measurements of body composition that are predictive of PTDM in kidney transplant recipients. Pre-transplant imaging contains a wealth of underutilized data that may inform PTDM prevention strategies.",

Autologous bone marrow stem cells may be a better cell source and have been studied for the treatment of cerebral palsy because of their functions in tissue repair and the regulation of immunological processes. METHODS: To assess autologous marrow stem cells as a novel treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe cerebral palsy, a total of 10 cerebral palsy patients were enrolled in this clinical study with 24 months follow-up. A total of 10 cerebral palsy patients received autologous bone marrow cells transplantation (4.5 \u00d7 10 RESULTS: We recorded the gross motor function measurement scores, manual ability function measurement score, and adverse events up to 24 months post-treatment. The gross motor function measurement scores were significantly higher at month 6 post-treatment compared with the baseline scores and were stable up to 24 months follow-up. The increase in manual ability and communication function measurement scores at 6 months were not significant when compared to the baseline score. All the 10 patients survived and none of the patients experienced any serious adverse events or complications. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that bone marrow derived MNCs are safe and effective for the treatment of motor deficits related to cerebral palsy.

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition, occurring when an infectious agent invades the body, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2\u03bcg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin. Early detection of bacteria followed by antimicrobial susceptibility test can help by selection of appropriate antibiotic and prevent spread of infection.",

CAR is manufactured to express T cells through various ways such as using retroviruses, transposons and transposase, electroporation, and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Together, it provides flexibility since it recognizes proteins without the need of antigen processing and presentation, can recognize carbohydrates and lipids, and it has been proven to be cost-effective. Despite these benefits however, problems faced by this therapy include unrecognized tumor proteins possibly escaping the system, CAR T cell expression being transient, and the therapy being one of the most expensive cancer drug ever approved. As a result, recent progress has been ongoing where researchers have combined CAR-T cells with natural killer (NK) cells and different cytokines to maximize its efficacy and potency while limiting potential risks such as cytokine release syndrome. Consequently, these cells gained the ability to be universal-being able to be used to treat multiple patients, maintain viability for a longer period, and prevent relapse.",

Six years old--the age at which children start the elementary school--is a key age for this screening. At the request of practitioners, a multidisciplinary staff had developed a screening tool: ERTLA6 (Epreuves de rep\u00e9rage des troubles du langage et des apprentissages de l'enfant de 6 ans). The objective was to validate the capacity of ERTLA6 to predict the school performance. A sample of 187 children was randomly constituted among the whole population of last year nursery school children in an area of France (the Acad\u00e9mie de Nancy-Metz). Those children, aged from 5 to 6, were screened with ERTLA6 by the school practitioner during a medical visit (score from 0 [the best] to 18 [the worse]). The School outcomes (considered as judgment criteria) were assessed 2 or 3 years later, after two years of elementary school. 148 children had completed their follow-up (the others: 27 moving house, 6 absents the day of evaluation, 2 missing data). Mean age was 5; 10 years. With a threshold > or = 7, ERTLA6 sensibility and specificity were respectively 79% [63-94] and 87% [81-93]; the positive predictive value was 58% [42-74], the negative predictive value was 95% [90-99]. The percentage of well classified children was 84% [69-99]. To our knowledge, ERTLA6 is the first validated tool in France for screening language and learning disorders which can be used by practitioners for the prediction of school outcomes.",

All preterm newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were eligible for this proof-of-concept, prospective case-control study. Infants were enrolled as \"cases\" if they developed EOS, and as \"controls\"if they did not. Plasma samples collected at birth and urine samples collected within 24 h of birth underwent untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis using mass spectrometry coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Of 123 eligible newborns, 15 developed EOS. These 15 newborns matched controls for gestational age and weight. Metabolomic analysis revealed evident clustering of the cases versus controls, with the glutathione and tryptophan metabolic pathways markedly disrupted in the former. In conclusion, neonates with EOS had a metabolic profile at birth that clearly distinguished them from those without sepsis, and metabolites of glutathione and tryptophan pathways are promising as new biomarkers of neonatal sepsis.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of childhood mortality. Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a nonintegrin tyrosine kinase receptor for collagen implicated in cell adhesion, proliferation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. We have previously demonstrated that transgenic mice lacking DDR1 are protected from hypertension-associated renal fibrosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of DDR1 in renal inflammation and fibrosis related to primitive tubulointerstitial injury. After 12 days of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), kidney histopathologic and real-time quantitative PCR analyses were performed in DDR1(-/-) and wild-type mice. DDR1 expression was strongly increased in the obstructed kidney. Wild-type mice developed important perivascular and interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. In comparison, DDR1(-/-) mice displayed reduced accumulation of fibrillar collagen and transforming growth factor \u03b2 expression. F4/80(+) cell count and proinflammatory cytokines were remarkably blunted in DDR1(-/-) obstructed kidneys. Leukocyte rolling and adhesion evaluated by intravital microscopy were not different between DDR1(-/-) and wild-type mice. Importantly, macrophages isolated from DDR1(-/-) mice presented similar M1/M2 polarization but displayed impaired migration in response to monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Together, these data suggest that DDR1 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of renal disease via enhanced inflammation. Inhibition of DDR1 expression or activity may represent a novel therapeutic target against the progression of renal diseases.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Determination of the characteristics of paediatric invasive bacterial infections (IBI) is essential for early identification of children requiring immediate antibiotic therapy. The main objective is to characterize the emergency presentation of the IBI among children aged younger than 14 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective registry-based cohort study including all patients aged younger than 14 years diagnosed with confirmed IBI (culture or genomic detection using the polymerase chain reaction) was carried out in a paediatric emergency department between 2008 and 2015. Severity criteria were as follows: death, sequelae or admission to the ICU. RESULTS: Of the 223 IBIs reported, 187 (83.9%) corresponded to previously healthy patients (median age=19 months) and 165 (74%) were well appearing. The most common diagnoses were occult bacteraemia [60 (26.9%)] and sepsis [56 (25.1%)]. The most frequent pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae [68 (30.5%)] and Neisseria meningitidis [42 (18.8%)]. Four (1.8) patients died (S. pneumoniae, 2) and eight (3.5%) had sequelae (S. pneumoniae, 5). The diagnoses and clinical characteristics of the children varied significantly depending on the isolated pathogen. Duration of fever less than 24\u2009h, symptoms other than fever and not being well-appearing upon arrival to the emergency department were independent risk factors for greater severity (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve=0.805; 95% confidence interval: 0.741-0.868). CONCLUSION: IBIs are commonly diagnosed in previously healthy and well-appearing young children. S. pneumoniae was responsible for the majority of deaths or sequelae. Short duration of fever, symptoms other than fever and not being stable on arrival are associated with greater severity.",

The most frequently observed complication of cannabis inebriation, however, is a short-lasting acute psychological disturbance with symptoms of panic, paranoid apprehension and personality disorganization. This type of reaction is often not dose-related, and could appropriately be termed \"pathological intoxication\". In addition to the acute effects of cannabis on mental performance and behaviour, this paper reviews the psychiatric consequences of chronic use and the accumulated evidence on organic toxicity associated with it: residual cognitive deficit, lethargic symptoms, cannabis psychosis, respiratory, gastro-intestinal and cardiovascular complications, as well as effects on immune response and gonadal functions, are discussed.

        "abstract": "Despite extensive research, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a progressive and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease. Limited knowledge of the underlying causes of ALS has made it difficult to target upstream biological mechanisms of disease, and therapeutic interventions are usually administered relatively late in the course of disease. Genetic forms of ALS offer a unique opportunity for therapeutic development, as genetic associations may reveal potential insights into disease etiology. Genetic ALS may also be amenable to investigating earlier intervention given the possibility of identifying clinically presymptomatic, at-risk individuals with causative genetic variants. There is increasing evidence for a presymptomatic phase of ALS, with biomarker data from the Pre-Symptomatic Familial ALS (Pre-fALS) study showing that an elevation in blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) precedes phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease. Tofersen is an investigational antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce synthesis of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein through degradation of SOD1 mRNA. Informed by Pre-fALS and the tofersen clinical development program, the ATLAS study (NCT04856982) is designed to evaluate the impact of initiating tofersen in presymptomatic carriers of SOD1 variants associated with high or complete penetrance and rapid disease progression who also have biomarker evidence of disease activity (elevated plasma NfL). The ATLAS study will investigate whether tofersen can delay the emergence of clinically manifest ALS. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first interventional trial in presymptomatic ALS and has the potential to yield important insights into the design and conduct of presymptomatic trials, identification, and monitoring of at-risk individuals, and future treatment paradigms in ALS.",

Studying all age groups is more suitable to assess the burden of single pathogens and their clinical relevance. METHODS: This is a retrospective regional study involving paediatric departments and NICUs in Emilia-Romagna (Italy). Regional laboratory databases were searched from 2009 to 2012. Records of infants (aged 4 to 90 days) with a positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture were retrospectively reviewed and analysed according to acquisition mode (whether hospital- or community-acquired). RESULTS: During the study period, there were 146,682 live births (LBs), with 296 patients experiencing 331 episodes of LOS (incidence rate: 2.3/1000 LBs). Brain lesions upon discharge from the hospital were found in 12.3% (40/296) of cases, with death occurring in 7.1% (23/296; 0.14/1000 LBs). With respect to full-term neonates, extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight neonates had very high risk of LOS and related mortality (> 100- and > 800-fold higher respectively). Hospital-acquired LOS (n = 209) was significantly associated with very low birth weight, extremely preterm birth, pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, and death (p< 0.01). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, catecholamine support (OR = 3.2), central venous line before LOS (OR = 14.9), and meningitis (OR = 44.7) were associated with brain lesions or death in hospital-acquired LOS (area under the ROC curve 0.81, H-L p = 0.41). Commonly identified pathogens included coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS n = 71, 21.4%), Escherichia coli (n = 50, 15.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 41, 12.4%) and Enterobacteriaceae (n = 41, 12.4%). Group B streptococcus was the predominant cause of meningitis (16 of 38 cases, 42%). Most pathogens were sensitive to first line antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first Italian data regarding late-onset sepsis (LOS) in all gestational age groups. Compared to full-term neonates, very high rates of LOS and mortality occurred in neonates with a lower birth weight and gestational age. Group B streptococcus was the leading cause of meningitis. Excluding CoNS, the predominant pathogens were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Neonates with hospital-acquired LOS had a worse outcome. Antibiotic associations, recommended for empirical treatment of hospital- or community-acquired LOS, were adequate.",

Since 1993 and the discovery of mutation in the SOD1 gene, number of genes linked to or promoting ALS had always growing. Among them, only four (SOD1, TARDBP, FUS and C9ORF72 genes) are unanimously recognized as convincing causative genetic factors for more than 60% of familial and probably 10% of sporadic ALS cases. Geographic origin of the studied populations tends to become one of the major items in the gene-ALS relationship: this was extremely stressed for C9ORF72. Concerning susceptibility genes factors, an increase of the risk of ALS is clearly shown for SMN1 and ATXN2 genes and accepted for some VEGF haplotypes. Finally, some modulating effects might also exist as underline for the relationships between ApoE and ALS that differ between European and North American studies. In inherited ALS, The European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) edited rules that gave a legal frame to situations for which research of mutations were justified. Progress in the field of genetic raises major questions concerning the relevance of genetic studies from asymptomatic relatives. This first implies that the mutation identified in the proband case is perfectly characterized as a pathogenic mutation.",

One of its severe effects is sub-fertility. The exact reason for endometriosis is still unknown and under investigation. Tracking the symptoms is not sufficient for diagnosing the disease. A successful diagnosis can only be made using laparoscopy. During the disease, the amount of some molecules (i.e., proteins, antigens) changes in the blood. Raman spectroscopy provides information about biochemicals without using dyes or external labels. In this study, Raman spectroscopy is used as a non-invasive diagnostic method for endometriosis. The Raman spectra of 94 serum samples acquired from 49 patients and 45 healthy individuals were compared for this study. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), k- Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used in the analysis. According to the results (using 80 measurements for training and 14 measurements for the test set), it was found that kNN-weighted gave the best classification model with sensitivity and specificity values of 80.5% and 89.7%, respectively. Testing the model with unseen data yielded a sensitivity value of 100% and a specificity value of 100%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which Raman spectroscopy was used in combination with PCA and classification algorithms as a non-invasive method applied on blood sera for the diagnosis of endometriosis.",

In the past years, myostatin inhibition sparked interest among the scientific community for its potential to enhance muscle growth and to reduce, or even prevent, muscle atrophy. These characteristics make it a promising target for the treatment of muscle atrophy in motor neuron diseases, namely, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which are rare neurological diseases, whereby the degeneration of motor neurons leads to progressive muscle loss and paralysis. These diseases carry a huge burden of morbidity and mortality but, despite this unfavorable scenario, several therapeutic advancements have been made in the past years. Indeed, a number of different curative therapies for SMA have been approved, leading to a revolution in the life expectancy and outcomes of SMA patients. Similarly, tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, is now undergoing clinical trial phase for use in ALS patients carrying the SOD1 mutation. However, these therapies are not able to completely halt or reverse progression of muscle damage. Recently, a trial evaluating apitegromab, a myostatin inhibitor, in SMA patients was started, following positive results from preclinical studies. In this context, myostatin inhibition could represent a useful strategy to tackle motor symptoms in these patients. The aim of this review is to describe the myostatin pathway and its role in motor neuron diseases, and to summarize and critically discuss preclinical and clinical studies of myostatin inhibitors in SMA and ALS. Then, we will highlight promises and pitfalls related to the use of myostatin inhibitors in the human setting, to aid the scientific community in the development of future clinical trials.",

Limited diagnostic tools and mechanistic insights have hampered our abilities to develop prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers in human neonatal sepsis have been repeatedly identified as associated with dysregulation of angiopoietin signaling and altered arachidonic acid metabolism. We here provide the mechanistic evidence in support of the relevance for these observations. Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns. Our data highlight that targeting angiogenesis-associated pathways with interventions that increase Ang-1 activity directly or indirectly through ROS/eNOS provide promising avenues to prevent and/or treat severe neonatal sepsis.",

Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2\u03bcg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin. Early detection of bacteria followed by antimicrobial susceptibility test can help by selection of appropriate antibiotic and prevent spread of infection.",

Since 2011, donated cryo-embryos from couples that have undergone<br />in vitro-fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) treatments, are being stored in our embryo<br />bank. The majority of the donated embryos were frozen on day 3 or 4 by slow freezing techniques. We perform a<br />thorough medical and psychological screening of donor couples and recipients, according to the protocol drawn up in<br />close collaboration with the Dutch Ministry of Health.<br />Results: Up to June 2021, 54 women have received embryos from our embryo bank, all single embryo transfers.<br />While the clinical pregnancy rate in 'unknown' embryo donations was relatively high (25.3%), the live birth rate<br />shows limited success (12.6%), partly due to high pregnancy loss through miscarriage. In known donation procedures,<br />the recipients tend to undergo more procedures, depending on the number of donated cryo-embryos. Twentyeight<br />women received embryos from known donors, with a clinical pregnancy rate per embryo transfer of 24%, and<br />live birth rate of 14%. In total, 82 recipients were granted donated cryo-embryos, twenty had an ongoing pregnancy<br />(24.4%), nineteen of whom have given birth to a healthy child (23%).<br />Conclusion: Altruistic embryo donation of embryos appears to be satisfying for the donors, as they are not obliged to destroy<br />their embryos, but instead help others build a family. Although success rates are still limited, partly due to the relatively high<br />miscarriage rates and inferior freezing techniques, to this date nineteen out of 82 recipients have given birth to a healthy child.",

        "abstract": "Myostatin is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth secreted by skeletal myocytes. In the past years, myostatin inhibition sparked interest among the scientific community for its potential to enhance muscle growth and to reduce, or even prevent, muscle atrophy. These characteristics make it a promising target for the treatment of muscle atrophy in motor neuron diseases, namely, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which are rare neurological diseases, whereby the degeneration of motor neurons leads to progressive muscle loss and paralysis. These diseases carry a huge burden of morbidity and mortality but, despite this unfavorable scenario, several therapeutic advancements have been made in the past years. Indeed, a number of different curative therapies for SMA have been approved, leading to a revolution in the life expectancy and outcomes of SMA patients. Similarly, tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, is now undergoing clinical trial phase for use in ALS patients carrying the SOD1 mutation. However, these therapies are not able to completely halt or reverse progression of muscle damage. Recently, a trial evaluating apitegromab, a myostatin inhibitor, in SMA patients was started, following positive results from preclinical studies. In this context, myostatin inhibition could represent a useful strategy to tackle motor symptoms in these patients. The aim of this review is to describe the myostatin pathway and its role in motor neuron diseases, and to summarize and critically discuss preclinical and clinical studies of myostatin inhibitors in SMA and ALS. Then, we will highlight promises and pitfalls related to the use of myostatin inhibitors in the human setting, to aid the scientific community in the development of future clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Despite extensive research, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a progressive and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease. Limited knowledge of the underlying causes of ALS has made it difficult to target upstream biological mechanisms of disease, and therapeutic interventions are usually administered relatively late in the course of disease. Genetic forms of ALS offer a unique opportunity for therapeutic development, as genetic associations may reveal potential insights into disease etiology. Genetic ALS may also be amenable to investigating earlier intervention given the possibility of identifying clinically presymptomatic, at-risk individuals with causative genetic variants. There is increasing evidence for a presymptomatic phase of ALS, with biomarker data from the Pre-Symptomatic Familial ALS (Pre-fALS) study showing that an elevation in blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) precedes phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease. Tofersen is an investigational antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce synthesis of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein through degradation of SOD1 mRNA. Informed by Pre-fALS and the tofersen clinical development program, the ATLAS study (NCT04856982) is designed to evaluate the impact of initiating tofersen in presymptomatic carriers of SOD1 variants associated with high or complete penetrance and rapid disease progression who also have biomarker evidence of disease activity (elevated plasma NfL). The ATLAS study will investigate whether tofersen can delay the emergence of clinically manifest ALS. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first interventional trial in presymptomatic ALS and has the potential to yield important insights into the design and conduct of presymptomatic trials, identification, and monitoring of at-risk individuals, and future treatment paradigms in ALS.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most studies regarding late-onset sepsis (LOS) address selected populations (i.e., neonates with low birth weight or extremely preterm neonates). Studying all age groups is more suitable to assess the burden of single pathogens and their clinical relevance. METHODS: This is a retrospective regional study involving paediatric departments and NICUs in Emilia-Romagna (Italy). Regional laboratory databases were searched from 2009 to 2012. Records of infants (aged 4 to 90 days) with a positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture were retrospectively reviewed and analysed according to acquisition mode (whether hospital- or community-acquired). RESULTS: During the study period, there were 146,682 live births (LBs), with 296 patients experiencing 331 episodes of LOS (incidence rate: 2.3/1000 LBs). Brain lesions upon discharge from the hospital were found in 12.3% (40/296) of cases, with death occurring in 7.1% (23/296; 0.14/1000 LBs). With respect to full-term neonates, extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight neonates had very high risk of LOS and related mortality (> 100- and > 800-fold higher respectively). Hospital-acquired LOS (n = 209) was significantly associated with very low birth weight, extremely preterm birth, pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, and death (p< 0.01). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, catecholamine support (OR = 3.2), central venous line before LOS (OR = 14.9), and meningitis (OR = 44.7) were associated with brain lesions or death in hospital-acquired LOS (area under the ROC curve 0.81, H-L p = 0.41). Commonly identified pathogens included coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS n = 71, 21.4%), Escherichia coli (n = 50, 15.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 41, 12.4%) and Enterobacteriaceae (n = 41, 12.4%). Group B streptococcus was the predominant cause of meningitis (16 of 38 cases, 42%). Most pathogens were sensitive to first line antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first Italian data regarding late-onset sepsis (LOS) in all gestational age groups. Compared to full-term neonates, very high rates of LOS and mortality occurred in neonates with a lower birth weight and gestational age. Group B streptococcus was the leading cause of meningitis. Excluding CoNS, the predominant pathogens were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Neonates with hospital-acquired LOS had a worse outcome. Antibiotic associations, recommended for empirical treatment of hospital- or community-acquired LOS, were adequate.",

        "abstract": "Endometriosis is a condition in which the endometrium, the layer of tissue that usually covers the inside of the uterus, grows outside the uterus. One of its severe effects is sub-fertility. The exact reason for endometriosis is still unknown and under investigation. Tracking the symptoms is not sufficient for diagnosing the disease. A successful diagnosis can only be made using laparoscopy. During the disease, the amount of some molecules (i.e., proteins, antigens) changes in the blood. Raman spectroscopy provides information about biochemicals without using dyes or external labels. In this study, Raman spectroscopy is used as a non-invasive diagnostic method for endometriosis. The Raman spectra of 94 serum samples acquired from 49 patients and 45 healthy individuals were compared for this study. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), k- Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used in the analysis. According to the results (using 80 measurements for training and 14 measurements for the test set), it was found that kNN-weighted gave the best classification model with sensitivity and specificity values of 80.5% and 89.7%, respectively. Testing the model with unseen data yielded a sensitivity value of 100% and a specificity value of 100%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which Raman spectroscopy was used in combination with PCA and classification algorithms as a non-invasive method applied on blood sera for the diagnosis of endometriosis.",

The aim of the study was to compare the metabolic profiles of plasma and urine samples collected at birth from preterm neonates with and without earlyonset sepsis (EOS) to identify metabolic perturbations that might orient the search for new early biomarkers. All preterm newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were eligible for this proof-of-concept, prospective case-control study. Infants were enrolled as \"cases\" if they developed EOS, and as \"controls\"if they did not. Plasma samples collected at birth and urine samples collected within 24 h of birth underwent untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis using mass spectrometry coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Of 123 eligible newborns, 15 developed EOS. These 15 newborns matched controls for gestational age and weight. Metabolomic analysis revealed evident clustering of the cases versus controls, with the glutathione and tryptophan metabolic pathways markedly disrupted in the former. In conclusion, neonates with EOS had a metabolic profile at birth that clearly distinguished them from those without sepsis, and metabolites of glutathione and tryptophan pathways are promising as new biomarkers of neonatal sepsis.",

Autologous bone marrow stem cells may be a better cell source and have been studied for the treatment of cerebral palsy because of their functions in tissue repair and the regulation of immunological processes. METHODS: To assess autologous marrow stem cells as a novel treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe cerebral palsy, a total of 10 cerebral palsy patients were enrolled in this clinical study with 24 months follow-up. A total of 10 cerebral palsy patients received autologous bone marrow cells transplantation (4.5 \u00d7 10 RESULTS: We recorded the gross motor function measurement scores, manual ability function measurement score, and adverse events up to 24 months post-treatment. The gross motor function measurement scores were significantly higher at month 6 post-treatment compared with the baseline scores and were stable up to 24 months follow-up. The increase in manual ability and communication function measurement scores at 6 months were not significant when compared to the baseline score. All the 10 patients survived and none of the patients experienced any serious adverse events or complications. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that bone marrow derived MNCs are safe and effective for the treatment of motor deficits related to cerebral palsy.

METHODS: Retrospective study, which evaluated data from patients admitted from January to December 2011 in the pediatric intensive care unit of the Children's Hospital of the University of Cairo. RESULTS: Out of 237 patients in the study, 72% had multiple organ dysfunctions, and 45% had sepsis with multiple organ dysfunctions. The mortality rate in patients with multiple organ dysfunction was 73%. Independent risk factors for death were mechanical ventilation and neurological failure [OR: 36 and 3.3, respectively]. The PRISM III score was more accurate than the PELOD score in predicting death, with a Hosmer-Lemeshow X2 (Chi-square value) of 7.3 (df = 8, p = 0.5). The area under the curve was 0.723 for PRISM III and 0.78 for PELOD. CONCLUSION: A multiple organ dysfunctions was associated with high mortality. Sepsis was the major cause. Pneumonia, diarrhea and central nervous system infections were the major causes of sepsis. PRISM III had a better calibration than the PELOD for prognosis of the patients, despite the high frequency of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

Due to the complex nature of LD and multiple disadvantages posed to the child due to LD, a multidisciplinary approach towards intervention is warranted. Given the paucity of evidence-based standardized treatment approaches, consensus guidelines for management of LD are needed. PROCESS: The meeting on formulation of national consensus guidelines on neurodevelopmental disorders was organized by Indian Academy of Pediatrics in Mumbai on 18th and 19th December, 2015. The invited experts included Pediatricians, Developmental Pediatricians, Pediatric Neurologists, Psychiatrists, Remedial Educators and Clinical Psychologists. The participants framed guidelines after extensive discussions. Thereafter, a committee was established to review and finalize the points discussed in the meeting. OBJECTIVE: To provide guidelines on evaluation and management of LD in children in India. RECOMMENDATIONS: A basic intervention approach should focus on: (i) interpretation of evaluation reports; (ii) description of specific skills that may be delayed (e.g., phoneme awareness and phonics; reading comprehension; spelling; number sense and organizational skills) and (iii) identification of co-morbidities. The intervention should be inter-disciplinary and individualized to each child. Required services include: developmental pediatrics evaluation; neurological evaluation; ophthalmology and audiology evaluation; clinical psychology assessment; occupational therapy, remedial education, counseling for family, and career-counselling.",

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review using data available at 1, 6, 12, and 24\u2009h after ICU admission to calculate the Pediatric Risk of Mortality 3 (PRISM-3), Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA), Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD-2), and Quick Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) scores. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to evaluate performance for prediction of attributable mortality. Sensitivity analyses included recalculation of scores using worst preceding values for each variable, excluding hematologic parameters, and prediction of alternative outcomes. SETTING: St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a pediatric comprehensive cancer center in the USA. PATIENTS: Pediatric patients (<25\u2009years of age) receiving conventional therapy for cancer admitted to the ICU with suspected sepsis between 2013 and 2019. RESULTS: Of 207 included episodes of suspected sepsis, attributable mortality was 16 (7.7%) and all evaluated sepsis scores performed poorly (maximal AUROC of 0.73 for qSOFA at 1 and 24\u2009h). Sensitivity analyses did not identify an alternative approach that significantly improved prediction. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available sepsis scores perform poorly for prediction of attributable mortality in children with cancer who present to ICU with suspected sepsis. More research is needed to identify reliable predictors of adverse outcomes in this population.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aging is a complex and gradual biological process that represents the major risk factor with respect to the development of chronic degenerative diseases, often associated with disability. Diet and nu-trition, coupled with proper physical activity have a significant impact on the health status of the elderly with a decreased risk of disease being indicative of successful aging. Musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia are the most frequently reported disorders among the elderly community. METHODS: This study presents a systematic review of the literature on the potential benefits of several nutra-ceuticals in promoting healthy aging and in reducing the risk of chronic diseases in elderly individuals. RESULTS: Dietary components including vitamins (vitamin C, B vitamin and vitamin K) flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, anthocyanins, and isoflavones), minerals (e.g., magnesium, zinc and potassium) and other nutrients such phytoestrogens, amino acids, and omega-3 fatty acids help in slowing the aging process, which ultimately results in increased lifespan and longevity. CONCLUSIONS: This paper highlights the key nutrients and phytochemicals of nutraceutical importance for the healthy aging of the elderly population. Although the scientific literature provides evidences of therapeutic effectiveness of nutraceuticals, more in-depth clinical investigations are needed.",

        "abstract": "Chronic fatigue and major depression (MDD)-like symptoms are common manifestations of multiple sclerosis (MS), both with huge impact on quality of life. Depression can manifest itself as fatigue, and depressive symptoms are often mistaken for fatigue, and vice versa. The two conditions are sometimes difficult to differentiate, and their relationship is unclear. Whether chronic fatigue and depression occur primarily, secondarily or coincidentally with activated immune-inflammatory pathways in MS is still under debate. We have carried out a descriptive review aiming to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between chronic fatigue and depression in MS, and the shared pathways that underpin both conditions. This review focuses on immune-inflammatory pathways, the kynurenine pathway and the gut-brain axis. It seems likely that proinflammatory cytokines, tryptophan catabolites (the KYN pathway) and the gut-brain axis are involved in the mechanisms causing chronic fatigue and MDD-like symptoms in MS. However, the evidence base is weak, and more research is needed. In order to advance our understanding of the underlying pathological mechanisms, MS-related fatigue and depression should be examined using a longitudinal design and both immune-inflammatory and KYN pathway biomarkers should be measured, relevant clinical characteristics judiciously registered, and self-report instruments for both fatigue and depression should be used.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Sepsis recognition is a clinical challenge in children. We aim to determine whether peripheral blood gene expression profiles are associated with pathogen type and sepsis severity in children with suspected sepsis. METHODS: This was a prospective pilot observational study in a tertiary pediatric emergency department with a convenience sample of children enrolled. Participants were older than 56 days and younger than 18 years, had suspected sepsis, and had not received broad-spectrum antibiotics in the previous 4 hours. Primary outcome was source pathogen, defined as confirmed bacterial source from sterile body fluid or confirmed viral source. Secondary outcome was sepsis severity, defined as maximum therapy required for shock reversal in the first 3 hospital days. We drew peripheral blood for ribonucleic acid isolation at the sepsis protocol activation, obtained gene expression measures with the GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array, and conducted differential expression analysis. RESULTS: We collected ribonucleic acid samples from a convenience sample of 122 children with suspected sepsis and 12 healthy controls. We compared the 66 children (54%) with confirmed bacterial or viral infection and found 558 differentially expressed genes, many related to interferon signaling or viral immunity. We did not find statistically significant gene expression differences in patients according to sepsis severity. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates feasibility of evaluating gene expression profiling data in children evaluated for sepsis in the pediatric emergency department setting. Our results suggest that gene expression profiling may facilitate identification of source pathogen in children with suspected sepsis, which could ultimately lead to improved tailoring of sepsis treatment and antimicrobial stewardship.",

        "abstract": "The effect of cytokines on non-traditional immunological targets under conditions of chronic inflammation is an ongoing subject of study. Fatigue is a symptom often associated with autoimmune diseases. Chronic inflammatory response and activated cell-mediated immunity are associated with cardiovascular myopathies which can be driven by muscle weakness and fatigue. Thus, we hypothesize that immune dysfunction-driven changes in myocyte mitochondria may play a critical role in fatigue-related pathogenesis. We show that persistent low-level expression of IFN-\u03b3 in designated IFN-\u03b3 AU-Rich Element deletion mice (ARE mice) under androgen exposure resulted in mitochondrial and metabolic deficiencies in myocytes from male or castrated ARE mice. Most notably, echocardiography unveiled that low ejection fraction in the left ventricle post-stress correlated with mitochondrial deficiencies, explaining how heart function decreases under stress. We report that inefficiencies and structural changes in mitochondria, with changes to expression of mitochondrial genes, are linked to male-biased fatigue and acute cardiomyopathy under stress. Our work highlights how male androgen hormone backgrounds and active autoimmunity reduce mitochondrial function and the ability to cope with stress and how pharmacological blockade of stress signal protects heart function. These studies provide new insight into the diverse actions of IFN-\u03b3 in fatigue, energy metabolism, and autoimmunity. \u00a9 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

        "abstract": "Almost 50% of the infertility cases are due to male factors. Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) allow to overcome the incapacity of these patients' spermatozoa to fertilize the oocyte and produce a viable and healthy offspring, but the efficiency of the different techniques has still the potential to improve. According to the latest reports of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC), the percentages of deliveries per ART cycle in 2014 and 2016 were 21 and 22%, respectively. Among the reasons for this relatively low efficiency, the quality of the spermatozoa has been pointed out as critical, and the presence of high percentages of DNA-damaged spermatozoa in patients' ejaculates is possibly one of the main factors reducing the ARTs outcomes. Thus, one of the main challenges in reproductive medicine is to ensure the highest quality of the spermatozoa used in ARTs, and specifically, in terms of genetic integrity.

The vitamin is a cofactor of a unique microsomal carboxylase which requires the reduced form of vitamin K, CO2, and molecular oxygen. The vitamin is apparently oxidized to its 2,3-epoxide during the carboxylation reaction. Liver microsomes also contain an enzyme which catalyzes the reduction of the epoxide to the vitamin, vitamin K epoxide reductase, and a number of vitamin K reductases.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The involvement of B-cells in multiple sclerosis has only recently emerged. Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the B-cell antigen CD20 with enhanced B-cell targeting. AREAS COVERED: This evaluation is of the identical ULTIMATE (UbLiTuximab In Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Effects) I and II trials comparing ublituximab (TG-1101) and teriflunomide in relapsing multiple sclerosis. The primary efficacy end point was the annualized relapse rate and was lower in the ublituximab than the teriflunomide group. EXPERT OPINION: The continuation rates to oral teriflunomide in ULTIMATE were higher than in other trials, possibly because of the supervised double-dummy protocol used with intravenous ublituximab. This may have contributed to the higher efficacy with teriflunomide in this trial than previously reported. Nevertheless, ublituximab was more effective than teriflunomide at reducing the annualized relapse rates and MRI endpoints, but not for no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the ULTIMATE trials did show that ublituximab was superior to teriflunomide in NEDA. Long-term studies of the adverse effects of ublituximab are required. Despite the positive results from ULTIMATE for ublituximab, it is still under the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and conclusions should await their findings.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mortality rate for children with septic shock is stil quite high in low-income and middle-income countries (31.7%). One of the most widely used scoring systems to assess mortality in sepsis or septic shock is Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD-2). However, it requires various laboratory evaluations. A non-invasive, fast and easy method is needed to assess the mortality of children with septic shock at an early stage. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the ability of Vascular Reactivity Index (VRI) compared with PELOD-2 score as a predictor of mortality in children with septic shock based on vascular response to vasoactive agents. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from children aged 1\u2009month to 18 years with septic shock treated in the ER and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the tertiary hospital from 2017 to 2021. The serial haemodynamic data were analysed including Systemic Vascular Resistant Index (SVRI) and the cardiac index from ultrasound cardiac output monitoring device was recorded in the first and sixth hours after the diagnosis of septic shock. The VRI was determined by dividing SVRI/Vasoactive Inotropic Score (ie, accumulated doses of dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, milrinone, vasopressin and norepinephrine). The receiver operating curve was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off point. RESULTS: A total of 68 subjects fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the median age was 54 months with a range of 2-204 months and the mortality rate was 47%. The majority of the patients who died were found in the high cardiac index and low SVRI group (17.6%). Moreover, the optimum cut-off point of VRI was obtained to predict mortality in septic shock of 32.1, with 87.5% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. The AUC for predicting death using VRI was 95% (95% CI 90% to 100%, p<0.001) and PELOD-2 92.6% (95% CI 96.4% to 98.8%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The VRI <32.1\u2009may potentially be used to predict mortality in children with septic shock and its predictive ability is as good as PELOD-2. The assessment of VRI is faster and easier than PELOD-2.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Laparoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis but the need for visual evidence of the disease is a major stumbling-block for both effective clinical management of affected patients as well as for research into this common and debilitating reproductive disease. Laparoscopy is invasive and often causes a delay in diagnosis and treatment, especially in symptomatic teenagers and young women. Moreover, the visual inspection of the pelvis has major limitations, particularly for the diagnosis of retroperitoneal lesions. It is therefore not surprising that considerable efforts are being made to improve imaging techniques and to evaluate the diagnostic value of potential molecular markers of disease. RECENT FINDINGS: High-resolution transvaginal ultrasonography and, in selected cases, magnetic resonance imaging improve the diagnosis of retroperitoneal pelvic endometriosis as well as the identification of lesions that involve pelvic organs. A variety of serum and endometrial markers are being evaluated for their diagnostic potential, particularly in endometriosis associated infertility. The first gene profiling studies are showing positive results and proteomic technology is being applied to identify novel diagnostic protein expression patterns. SUMMARY: Current imaging techniques, such as transvaginal ultrasonography, are useful to screen the pelvis for the presence of retroperitoneal endometriosis but fail to diagnose peritoneal lesions, small ovarian endometriomas and adhesions. Postgenomic technologies and identification of novel serum and endometrial markers are likely to revolutionize future diagnosis of endometriosis.",

OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the performance of a multicenter network for ultra-rapid genomic diagnosis in a public health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Descriptive feasibility study of critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions treated at 12 Australian hospitals between March 2018 and February 2019, with data collected to May 2019. A formal implementation strategy emphasizing communication and feedback, standardized processes, coordination, distributed leadership, and collective learning was used to facilitate adoption. EXPOSURES: Ultra-rapid exome sequencing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report. The secondary outcomes were the molecular diagnostic yield, the change in clinical management after the ultra-rapid exome sequencing report, the time from hospital admission to the laboratory report, and the proportion of laboratory reports returned prior to death or hospital discharge. RESULTS: The study population included 108 patients with a median age of 28 days (range, 0 days to 17 years); 34% were female; and 57% were from neonatal intensive care units, 33% were from pediatric intensive care units, and 9% were from other hospital wards. The mean time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 3.3 days (95% CI, 3.2-3.5 days) and the median time was 3 days (range, 2-7 days). The mean time from hospital admission to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 17.5 days (95% CI, 14.6-21.1 days) and 93 reports (86%) were issued prior to death or hospital discharge. A molecular diagnosis was established in 55 patients (51%). Eleven diagnoses (20%) resulted from using the following approaches to augment standard exome sequencing analysis: mitochondrial genome sequencing analysis, exome sequencing-based copy number analysis, use of international databases to identify novel gene-disease associations, and additional phenotyping and RNA analysis. In 42 of 55 patients (76%) with a molecular diagnosis and 6 of 53 patients (11%) without a molecular diagnosis, the ultra-rapid exome sequencing result was considered as having influenced clinical management. Targeted treatments were initiated in 12 patients (11%), treatment was redirected toward palliative care in 14 patients (13%), and surveillance for specific complications was initiated in 19 patients (18%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests feasibility of ultra-rapid genomic testing in critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions in the Australian public health care system. However, further research is needed to understand the clinical value of such testing, and the generalizability of the findings to other health care settings.",

Disease-modifying therapies targeting T cells have, indeed, shown remarkable efficacy in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. However, these therapies do also target B cells, and a B-cell-depleting monoclonal antibody (ocrelizumab) has recently been approved for MS therapy and is efficacious not only in relapsing forms of MS but also in some patients with primary progressive MS. This suggests that B cells may play a more important role in the pathogenesis of MS than previously appreciated. We review the potential roles of B cells, which are the precursors of antibody-secreting plasma cells in the pathogenesis of MS. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the characteristics and clinical data for the four monoclonal antibodies (ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, rituximab, and ublituximab) that have been approved, are currently been used off-label or are being investigated as treatments for MS. These antibodies all target the cluster of differentiation (CD)-20 molecule and bind to distinct or overlapping epitopes on B cells and a subset of T cells that express CD20. This leads to B-cell depletion and, possibly, to depletion of CD20-positive T cells. The net result is strong suppression of clinical and radiological disease activity as well as slowing of the development of persisting neurological impairment.",

Randomized controlled trials have generally failed to find differences in mood symptoms between OC and placebo users, but observational studies comparing OC users to non-users have reported increases in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. Additionally, observational evidence suggests that OC users may be more likely to use prescription psychotropic medications and to attempt or die by suicide. However, responses to OC treatment are highly heterogeneous, and some users report mood improvement. A variety of factors may increase the likelihood of negative psychiatric side effects, including younger age, previous experience of side effects from OCs, and preexisting psychiatric disorders. Progestin-only pills may confer a higher psychiatric risk than combination pills. KEY MESSAGES: Further research investigating factors that contribute to susceptibility to the mood-related side effects of OCs is clearly warranted. Genomic approaches may provide insight as to why some users experience side effects while others do not. Research elucidating who is most at risk and why will be essential to addressing prevalent concerns about the psychiatric risk of OCs.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has dramatically altered the landscape of treatment options available to children and adults with ALL. With complete remission induction rates exceeding 70% in most trials and FDA approval of one CD19 CAR T-cell construct in ALL, CAR T-cell therapy has become a mainstay in the ALL treatment algorithm for those with relapsed/refractory disease. Despite the high remission induction rate, with growing experience using CAR T-cell therapy in ALL, a host of barriers to maintaining long-term durable remissions have been identified. Specifically, relapse after, resistance to, or loss of long-term CAR T-cell persistence may all hinder CAR T-cell efficacy. In this review, we provide an overview of the current limitations which inform the design of the next generation of CAR T-cells and discuss advances in CAR T-cell engineering aimed to improve upon outcomes with CAR T-cell-based therapy in ALL.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease, is the main cause of dementia and one of the leading causes of death for elderly people in the USA. Lecanemab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid protofibrils for the treatment of early AD [i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD dementia]. In a recent 18-month phase\u00a0III trial, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, lecanemab treatment led to reduced brain amyloid burden and significant improvements in cognitive and functional abilities in individuals with early AD. METHODS: An evidence-based patient-level disease simulation model was updated to estimate the long-term health outcomes of lecanemab plus standard of care (SoC) compared to SoC alone in patients with early AD and evidence of brain amyloid burden, using recent phase\u00a0III trial data and published literature. The disease progression is described by changes in the underlying biomarkers of AD, including measures of amyloid and tau, and their connection to the clinical presentation of the disease assessed through various patient-level scales of cognition and function. RESULTS: Lecanemab treatment was estimated to slow the progression of AD to moderate and severe stages and reduce the time spent in these more advanced states. In individuals with early AD, lecanemab plus SoC was associated with a gain of 0.71 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), a 2.95-year delay in mean time to progression to AD dementia, a reduction of 0.11\u00a0years in institutional care, and an additional 1.07\u00a0years in community care as shown in the base-case study. Improved health outcomes were demonstrated with lecanemab treatment when initiated earlier based on age, disease severity, or tau pathology, resulting in estimated gains in QALYs ranging from 0.77 to 1.09\u00a0years, compared to 0.4\u00a0years in the mild AD dementia subset, as shown by the model. CONCLUSION: The study findings demonstrate the potential clinical value of lecanemab for individuals with early AD by slowing down disease progression and prolonging time in earlier stages of disease, which significantly benefits not only patients and caregivers but also society overall.

Here, we report a multi-omic analysis of a geographically diverse cohort of 106 cases and 91 healthy controls that revealed differences in gut microbiome diversity, abundances, functional pathways, and interactions. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Eubacterium rectale, which are both recognized as abundant, health-promoting butyrate producers in the human gut, were reduced in ME/CFS. Functional metagenomics, qPCR, and metabolomics of fecal short-chain fatty acids confirmed a deficient microbial capacity for butyrate synthesis. Microbiome-based machine learning classifier models were robust to geographic variation and generalizable in a validation cohort. The abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was inversely associated with fatigue severity. These findings demonstrate the functional nature of gut dysbiosis and the underlying microbial network disturbance in ME/CFS, providing possible targets for disease classification and therapeutic trials.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a need for novel therapies for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a validated target. Teclistamab is a bispecific antibody that binds BCMA and CD3 to redirect T cells to multiple myeloma cells. The aim of the MajesTEC-1 study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of teclistamab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. METHODS: This open-label, single-arm, phase 1 study enrolled patients with multiple myeloma who were relapsed, refractory, or intolerant to established therapies. Teclistamab was administered intravenously (range 0\u00b73-19\u00b72 \u03bcg/kg [once every 2 weeks] or 19\u00b72-720 \u03bcg/kg [once per week]) or subcutaneously (range 80-3000 \u03bcg/kg [once per week]) in different cohorts, with step-up dosing for 38\u00b74 \u03bcg/kg or higher doses. The primary objectives were to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (part one) and characterise teclistamab safety and tolerability at the recommended phase 2 dose (part two). Safety was assessed in all patients treated with at least one dose of teclistamab. Efficacy was analysed in response-evaluable patients (ie, patients who received at least one dose of teclistamab and had at least one post-baseline response evaluation). This ongoing trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03145181. FINDINGS: Between June 8, 2017, and March 29, 2021, 219 patients were screened for study inclusion, and 157 patients (median six previous therapy lines) were enrolled and received at least one dose of teclistamab (intravenous n=84; subcutaneous n=73). 40 patients were administered the recommended phase 2 dose, identified as once per week subcutaneous administration of teclistamab at 1500 \u03bcg/kg, after 60 \u03bcg/kg and 300 \u03bcg/kg step-up doses (median follow-up 6\u00b71 months, IQR 3\u00b76-8\u00b72). There were no dose-limiting toxicities at the recommended phase 2 dose in part one. In the 40 patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were cytokine release syndrome in 28 (70%; all grade 1 or 2 events) and neutropenia in 26 (65%) patients (grade 3 or 4 in 16 [40%]). The overall response rate in response-evaluable patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose (n=40) was 65% (95% CI 48-79); 58% achieved a very good partial response or better. At the recommended phase 2 dose, the median duration of response was not reached. 22 (85%) of 26 responders were alive and continuing treatment after 7\u00b71 months' median follow-up (IQR 5\u00b71-9\u00b71). At the recommended phase 2 dose, teclistamab exposure was maintained above target exposure levels, and consistent T-cell activation was reported. INTERPRETATION: Teclistamab is a novel treatment approach for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. At the recommended phase 2 dose, teclistamab showed promising efficacy, with durable responses that deepened over time, and was well tolerated, supporting further clinical development.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA for lower limb spasticity treatment in children with cerebral palsy. METHODS: In this registrational phase 3, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT01603628), children (2-<\u200a17 years) with cerebral palsy and ankle spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale-Bohannon [MAS] score\u22652) were randomized 1\u200a:\u200a1\u200a:\u200a1 to standardized physical therapy and onabotulinumtoxinA (4 or 8\u200aU/kg), or placebo. Primary endpoint was average change from baseline at weeks 4 and 6 in MAS ankle score. Secondary endpoints included the Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS) and Global Attainment Scale (GAS). RESULTS: 381 participants were randomized. MAS scores averaged at weeks 4 and 6 were significantly reduced with both onabotulinumtoxinA doses (8\u200aU/kg: -1.06, p\u200a=\u200a0.010; 4\u200aU/kg: -1.01, p\u200a=\u200a0.033) versus placebo (-0.8). Significant improvements in average dynamic component of spasticity, measured by MTS, and in function, measured by GAS, were observed at several time points with both onabotulinumtoxinA doses versus placebo. Most adverse events were mild or moderate. CONCLUSIONS: OnabotulinumtoxinA was well tolerated and effective in reducing lower limb spasticity and improving functional outcomes versus placebo in children.",

        "title": "Saving and empowering young lives in Europe (SEYLE): a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors. METHODS AND DESIGN: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes. DISCUSSION: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

        "title": "Oncolytic viruses as a promising therapeutic strategy against the detrimental health impacts of air pollution: The case of glioblastoma multiforme.",
        "abstract": "Human livelihood highly depends on applying different sources of energy whose utilization is associated with air pollution. On the other hand, air pollution may be associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Unlike other environmental causes of cancer (e.g., irradiation), air pollution cannot efficiently be controlled by geographical borders, regulations, and policies. The unavoidable exposure to air pollution can modify cancer incidence and mortality. GBM treatment with chemotherapy or even its surgical removal has proven insufficient (100% recurrence rate; patient's survival mean of 15 months; 90% fatality within five years) due to glioma infiltrative and migratory capacities. Given the barrage of attention and research investments currently plowed into next-generation cancer therapy, oncolytic viruses are perhaps the most vigorously pursued. Provision of an insight into the current state of the research and future direction is essential for stimulating new ideas with the potentials of filling research gaps. This review manuscript aims to overview types of brain cancer, their burden, and different causative agents. It also describes why air pollution is becoming a concerning factor. The different opinions on the association of air pollution with brain cancer are reviewed. It tries to address the significant controversy in this field by hypothesizing the air-pollution-brain-cancer association via inflammation and atopic conditions. The last section of this review deals with the oncolytic viruses, which have been used in, or are still under clinical trials for GBM treatment. Engineered adenoviruses (i.e., DNX-2401, DNX-2440, CRAd8-S-pk7 loaded Neural stem cells), herpes simplex virus type 1 (i.e., HSV-1 C134, HSV-1 rQNestin34.5v.2, HSV-1 G207, HSV-1 M032), measles virus (i.e., MV-CEA), parvovirus (i.e., ParvOryx), poliovirus (i.e., Poliovirus PVSRIPO), reovirus (i.e., pelareorep), moloney murine leukemia virus (i.e., Toca 511 vector), and vaccinia virus (i.e., vaccinia virus TG6002) as possible life-changing alleviations for GBM have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first review that comprehensively discusses both (i) the negative/positive association of air pollution with GBM; and (ii) the application of oncolytic viruses for GBM, including the most recent advances and clinical trials. It is also the first review that addresses the controversies over air pollution and brain cancer association. We believe that the article will significantly appeal to a broad readership of virologists, oncologists, neurologists, environmentalists, and those who work in the field of (bio)energy. Policymakers may also use it to establish better health policies and regulations about air pollution and (bio)fuels exploration, production, and consumption.",

The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD \u00b1 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged .16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged .15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called 'invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised riskbehaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the \"invisible\" risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.",

Genome-wide gene expression analysis can provide insights into the molecular alterations of sepsis. Total mRNA was extracted from the livers of 6 uninfected control mice and 60 septic mice after infusion of either live Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus. Using a murine complementary DNA microarray system, changes in gene expression were monitored at six time points (uninfected, 2, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours). Overall, 4.8% of 6,144 assessed genes were differentially regulated with a greater than twofold change across all time points. Most of the genes with altered expression were commonly present in gram-negative and gram-positive sepsis, but the expression levels of 17 genes were different between both types of sepsis at particular time points after infection. The microarray results support the hypothesis that both gram-positive and gram-negative sepsis share a final common pathway involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis, but certain genes are differentially expressed under distinct regulation. These results may provide insights into the pathogenesis of sepsis and may also help identify some altered genes that can serve as new targets for diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies.",

The 2 types of oral contraceptive pills are combination oral contraceptives, which contain estrogen and progesterone, and progestin-only pills. Both have failure rates of approximately 7.2-9% with typical use and are safe for most patients. However, several thrombotic and vascular complications have been found to be associated with the usage of oral contraceptive pills, most notably being an increase in blood pressure and thrombosis. Although these complications do not typically affect young, healthy females, they merit concern for patients with a history of hypertension or thrombosis or patients with preexisting risk factors for these conditions. Overall, progestin-only pills are the safer option regarding these complications. Additionally, a complete summary of the medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use has been created and is regularly updated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

        "abstract": "Vestibular migraine (VM) is the most common cause of spontaneous vertigo but remains poorly understood. We investigated the hypothesis that central vestibular pathways are sensitized in VM by measuring self-motion perceptual thresholds in patients and control subjects and by characterizing the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and vestibular and headache symptom severity. VM patients were abnormally sensitive to roll tilt, which co-modulates semicircular canal and otolith organ activity, but not to motions that activate the canals or otolith organs in isolation, implying sensitization of canal-otolith integration. When tilt thresholds were considered together with vestibular symptom severity or VOR dynamics, VM patients segregated into two clusters. Thresholds in one cluster correlated positively with symptoms and with the VOR time constant; thresholds in the second cluster were uniformly low and independent of symptoms and the time constant. The VM threshold abnormality showed a frequency-dependence that paralleled the brain stem velocity storage mechanism. These results support a pathogenic model where vestibular symptoms emanate from the vestibular nuclei, which are sensitized by migraine-related brainstem regions and simultaneously suppressed by inhibitory feedback from the cerebellar nodulus and uvula, the site of canal-otolith integration. This conceptual framework elucidates VM pathophysiology and could potentially facilitate its diagnosis and treatment.",

Barriers, including antigen selection and on-target/off-tumor toxicity, have prevented the rapid development of immune-based therapies for T-lineage and myeloid malignancies. More recently, unique strategies have been developed to overcome these barriers, with several products advancing to clinical trials. For T-lineage diseases, targets have focused on CD5, CD7, and CD38, whereas myeloid disease targets have predominately focused on CD123, CD33, and, more recently, CLL-1.

        "title": "Gender as risk factor for autoimmune diseases.",
        "abstract": "Most autoimmune diseases occur significantly more frequently in women than men. This female preponderance for abnormal autoimmune function has largely gone unexplained. Many investigations have concentrated on the effects of female and male sex hormones on immune function, by suggesting that estrogens favor the antibody production-enhancing Th2 response and, by doing so, possibly, increase the risk towards abnormal autoimmune function. Others have suggested that women are genetically predisposed towards abnormal autoimmune function, possibly because the X chromosome may confer susceptibility towards tolerance breakdown. Recent developments have, however, opened new research avenues. The possible association between persistent fetal-maternal microchimerism and the development of autoimmune diseases has attracted special interest. Since, in analogy to allogeneic organ transplantation, fetal-maternal (and maternal-fetal) microchimerism may play an important role in the immunologic tolerance of the fetal semi-allograft, female preponderance for autoimmune diseases may be understood as a consequence of increased allogeneic cell traffic in females (in comparison to males), increased risk for long-term microchimerism and, therefore, as a consequence of the former two, the development of abnormal autoimmunity. Under an evolutionary view point the occurrence of autoimmune diseases, in general, can be seen as the price to be paid for successful reproduction. In view of increased exposure to cell traffic, women, of course, would be expected to pay a higher price, reflected in more autoimmunity.",

Neurophysiological observations suggest that motor mechanisms play a role in the pathophysiology of fatigue but there is no clear correlation between fatigue measured with clinical instruments and fatigue assessed with neurophysiological tests.

Ublituximab (ublituximab-xiiy) is the latest approved chimeric glycoengineered anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS. AREAS COVERED: In this narrative review, the authors explore the safety and effectiveness of data derived from the Phase 2 and Phase 3 ublituximab trials and from their respective post-hoc analyses. Moreover, they consider the similarities and differences between the currently available anti-CD20 antibodies for treatment of relapsing MS. Lastly, the authors discuss the role and place of ublituximab in the current disease modifying therapy landscape. EXPERT OPINION: Ublituximab is a rapid-acting and effective anti-inflammatory option as a treatment in people with relapsing MS that significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate and MRI-based disease activity. When compared to the Phase III trials of the other two anti-CD20 mAbs (ocrelizumab and ofatumumab), ublituximab did not result with reduction of 3 or 6-month confirmed disability progression. These differences may be attributed to the overall low rate of progression in both the ublituximab and the active comparator teriflunomide arm. Future data from open-label extensions are warranted. There was no significant reduction of ublituximab on whole-brain atrophy compared to teriflunomide.",

The recently established therapeutic targeting of B cells in MS patients using CD20 monoclonal antibodies (CD20-mAbs) not only profoundly suppresses inflammatory disease activity but also materializes as the first treatment approach against disability accumulation in a subset of patients with primary progressive MS. AREAS COVERED: We will review current concepts regarding the immunopathology of B cells as well as results of clinical trials with CD20-mAbs in MS, from the murine-human chimeras rituximab and ublituximab to their increasingly humanized counterparts ocrelizumab and ofatumumab. We conducted a literature search using PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov, and clinicaltrialsregister.eu. We will focus on studies emphasizing the effectiveness of these mAbs in reducing MS disease activity and progression, long-term safety, optimal dosage and maintenance regimens. Lastly, we will turn to outstanding questions regarding anti-CD20 therapy in MS. EXPERT OPINION: CD20-mAbs could become first-line drugs in selected patients with highly active MS and already constitute an option for PPMS. Future studies could evaluate whether administration regimens currently in use can be optimized, while registry data could shed light on risk versus benefits on the long run, considering immunosenescence and a potentially increased risk of malignancies and infections in an aging population.",

Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) allow to overcome the incapacity of these patients' spermatozoa to fertilize the oocyte and produce a viable and healthy offspring, but the efficiency of the different techniques has still the potential to improve. According to the latest reports of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC), the percentages of deliveries per ART cycle in 2014 and 2016 were 21 and 22%, respectively. Among the reasons for this relatively low efficiency, the quality of the spermatozoa has been pointed out as critical, and the presence of high percentages of DNA-damaged spermatozoa in patients' ejaculates is possibly one of the main factors reducing the ARTs outcomes. Thus, one of the main challenges in reproductive medicine is to ensure the highest quality of the spermatozoa used in ARTs, and specifically, in terms of genetic integrity.

OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the performance of a multicenter network for ultra-rapid genomic diagnosis in a public health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Descriptive feasibility study of critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions treated at 12 Australian hospitals between March 2018 and February 2019, with data collected to May 2019. A formal implementation strategy emphasizing communication and feedback, standardized processes, coordination, distributed leadership, and collective learning was used to facilitate adoption. EXPOSURES: Ultra-rapid exome sequencing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report. The secondary outcomes were the molecular diagnostic yield, the change in clinical management after the ultra-rapid exome sequencing report, the time from hospital admission to the laboratory report, and the proportion of laboratory reports returned prior to death or hospital discharge. RESULTS: The study population included 108 patients with a median age of 28 days (range, 0 days to 17 years); 34% were female; and 57% were from neonatal intensive care units, 33% were from pediatric intensive care units, and 9% were from other hospital wards. The mean time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 3.3 days (95% CI, 3.2-3.5 days) and the median time was 3 days (range, 2-7 days). The mean time from hospital admission to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 17.5 days (95% CI, 14.6-21.1 days) and 93 reports (86%) were issued prior to death or hospital discharge. A molecular diagnosis was established in 55 patients (51%). Eleven diagnoses (20%) resulted from using the following approaches to augment standard exome sequencing analysis: mitochondrial genome sequencing analysis, exome sequencing-based copy number analysis, use of international databases to identify novel gene-disease associations, and additional phenotyping and RNA analysis. In 42 of 55 patients (76%) with a molecular diagnosis and 6 of 53 patients (11%) without a molecular diagnosis, the ultra-rapid exome sequencing result was considered as having influenced clinical management. Targeted treatments were initiated in 12 patients (11%), treatment was redirected toward palliative care in 14 patients (13%), and surveillance for specific complications was initiated in 19 patients (18%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests feasibility of ultra-rapid genomic testing in critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions in the Australian public health care system. However, further research is needed to understand the clinical value of such testing, and the generalizability of the findings to other health care settings.",

We aim to determine whether peripheral blood gene expression profiles are associated with pathogen type and sepsis severity in children with suspected sepsis. METHODS: This was a prospective pilot observational study in a tertiary pediatric emergency department with a convenience sample of children enrolled. Participants were older than 56 days and younger than 18 years, had suspected sepsis, and had not received broad-spectrum antibiotics in the previous 4 hours. Primary outcome was source pathogen, defined as confirmed bacterial source from sterile body fluid or confirmed viral source. Secondary outcome was sepsis severity, defined as maximum therapy required for shock reversal in the first 3 hospital days. We drew peripheral blood for ribonucleic acid isolation at the sepsis protocol activation, obtained gene expression measures with the GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array, and conducted differential expression analysis. RESULTS: We collected ribonucleic acid samples from a convenience sample of 122 children with suspected sepsis and 12 healthy controls. We compared the 66 children (54%) with confirmed bacterial or viral infection and found 558 differentially expressed genes, many related to interferon signaling or viral immunity. We did not find statistically significant gene expression differences in patients according to sepsis severity. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates feasibility of evaluating gene expression profiling data in children evaluated for sepsis in the pediatric emergency department setting. Our results suggest that gene expression profiling may facilitate identification of source pathogen in children with suspected sepsis, which could ultimately lead to improved tailoring of sepsis treatment and antimicrobial stewardship.",

        "abstract": "Most autoimmune diseases occur significantly more frequently in women than men. This female preponderance for abnormal autoimmune function has largely gone unexplained. Many investigations have concentrated on the effects of female and male sex hormones on immune function, by suggesting that estrogens favor the antibody production-enhancing Th2 response and, by doing so, possibly, increase the risk towards abnormal autoimmune function. Others have suggested that women are genetically predisposed towards abnormal autoimmune function, possibly because the X chromosome may confer susceptibility towards tolerance breakdown. Recent developments have, however, opened new research avenues. The possible association between persistent fetal-maternal microchimerism and the development of autoimmune diseases has attracted special interest. Since, in analogy to allogeneic organ transplantation, fetal-maternal (and maternal-fetal) microchimerism may play an important role in the immunologic tolerance of the fetal semi-allograft, female preponderance for autoimmune diseases may be understood as a consequence of increased allogeneic cell traffic in females (in comparison to males), increased risk for long-term microchimerism and, therefore, as a consequence of the former two, the development of abnormal autoimmunity. Under an evolutionary view point the occurrence of autoimmune diseases, in general, can be seen as the price to be paid for successful reproduction. In view of increased exposure to cell traffic, women, of course, would be expected to pay a higher price, reflected in more autoimmunity.",

        "abstract": "An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7th Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD \u00b1 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged .16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged .15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called 'invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised riskbehaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the \"invisible\" risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mortality rate for children with septic shock is stil quite high in low-income and middle-income countries (31.7%). One of the most widely used scoring systems to assess mortality in sepsis or septic shock is Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD-2). However, it requires various laboratory evaluations. A non-invasive, fast and easy method is needed to assess the mortality of children with septic shock at an early stage. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the ability of Vascular Reactivity Index (VRI) compared with PELOD-2 score as a predictor of mortality in children with septic shock based on vascular response to vasoactive agents. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from children aged 1\u2009month to 18 years with septic shock treated in the ER and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the tertiary hospital from 2017 to 2021. The serial haemodynamic data were analysed including Systemic Vascular Resistant Index (SVRI) and the cardiac index from ultrasound cardiac output monitoring device was recorded in the first and sixth hours after the diagnosis of septic shock. The VRI was determined by dividing SVRI/Vasoactive Inotropic Score (ie, accumulated doses of dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, milrinone, vasopressin and norepinephrine). The receiver operating curve was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off point. RESULTS: A total of 68 subjects fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the median age was 54 months with a range of 2-204 months and the mortality rate was 47%. The majority of the patients who died were found in the high cardiac index and low SVRI group (17.6%). Moreover, the optimum cut-off point of VRI was obtained to predict mortality in septic shock of 32.1, with 87.5% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. The AUC for predicting death using VRI was 95% (95% CI 90% to 100%, p<0.001) and PELOD-2 92.6% (95% CI 96.4% to 98.8%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The VRI <32.1\u2009may potentially be used to predict mortality in children with septic shock and its predictive ability is as good as PELOD-2. The assessment of VRI is faster and easier than PELOD-2.",

METHODS: Retrospective study, which evaluated data from patients admitted from January to December 2011 in the pediatric intensive care unit of the Children's Hospital of the University of Cairo. RESULTS: Out of 237 patients in the study, 72% had multiple organ dysfunctions, and 45% had sepsis with multiple organ dysfunctions. The mortality rate in patients with multiple organ dysfunction was 73%. Independent risk factors for death were mechanical ventilation and neurological failure [OR: 36 and 3.3, respectively]. The PRISM III score was more accurate than the PELOD score in predicting death, with a Hosmer-Lemeshow X2 (Chi-square value) of 7.3 (df = 8, p = 0.5). The area under the curve was 0.723 for PRISM III and 0.78 for PELOD. CONCLUSION: A multiple organ dysfunctions was associated with high mortality. Sepsis was the major cause. Pneumonia, diarrhea and central nervous system infections were the major causes of sepsis. PRISM III had a better calibration than the PELOD for prognosis of the patients, despite the high frequency of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Widespread adoption of rapid genomic testing in pediatric critical care requires robust clinical and laboratory pathways that provide equitable and consistent service across health care systems. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the performance of a multicenter network for ultra-rapid genomic diagnosis in a public health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Descriptive feasibility study of critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions treated at 12 Australian hospitals between March 2018 and February 2019, with data collected to May 2019. A formal implementation strategy emphasizing communication and feedback, standardized processes, coordination, distributed leadership, and collective learning was used to facilitate adoption. EXPOSURES: Ultra-rapid exome sequencing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report. The secondary outcomes were the molecular diagnostic yield, the change in clinical management after the ultra-rapid exome sequencing report, the time from hospital admission to the laboratory report, and the proportion of laboratory reports returned prior to death or hospital discharge. RESULTS: The study population included 108 patients with a median age of 28 days (range, 0 days to 17 years); 34% were female; and 57% were from neonatal intensive care units, 33% were from pediatric intensive care units, and 9% were from other hospital wards. The mean time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 3.3 days (95% CI, 3.2-3.5 days) and the median time was 3 days (range, 2-7 days). The mean time from hospital admission to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 17.5 days (95% CI, 14.6-21.1 days) and 93 reports (86%) were issued prior to death or hospital discharge. A molecular diagnosis was established in 55 patients (51%). Eleven diagnoses (20%) resulted from using the following approaches to augment standard exome sequencing analysis: mitochondrial genome sequencing analysis, exome sequencing-based copy number analysis, use of international databases to identify novel gene-disease associations, and additional phenotyping and RNA analysis. In 42 of 55 patients (76%) with a molecular diagnosis and 6 of 53 patients (11%) without a molecular diagnosis, the ultra-rapid exome sequencing result was considered as having influenced clinical management. Targeted treatments were initiated in 12 patients (11%), treatment was redirected toward palliative care in 14 patients (13%), and surveillance for specific complications was initiated in 19 patients (18%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests feasibility of ultra-rapid genomic testing in critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions in the Australian public health care system. However, further research is needed to understand the clinical value of such testing, and the generalizability of the findings to other health care settings.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mortality rate for children with septic shock is stil quite high in low-income and middle-income countries (31.7%). One of the most widely used scoring systems to assess mortality in sepsis or septic shock is Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD-2). However, it requires various laboratory evaluations. A non-invasive, fast and easy method is needed to assess the mortality of children with septic shock at an early stage. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the ability of Vascular Reactivity Index (VRI) compared with PELOD-2 score as a predictor of mortality in children with septic shock based on vascular response to vasoactive agents. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from children aged 1\u2009month to 18 years with septic shock treated in the ER and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the tertiary hospital from 2017 to 2021. The serial haemodynamic data were analysed including Systemic Vascular Resistant Index (SVRI) and the cardiac index from ultrasound cardiac output monitoring device was recorded in the first and sixth hours after the diagnosis of septic shock. The VRI was determined by dividing SVRI/Vasoactive Inotropic Score (ie, accumulated doses of dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, milrinone, vasopressin and norepinephrine). The receiver operating curve was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off point. RESULTS: A total of 68 subjects fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the median age was 54 months with a range of 2-204 months and the mortality rate was 47%. The majority of the patients who died were found in the high cardiac index and low SVRI group (17.6%). Moreover, the optimum cut-off point of VRI was obtained to predict mortality in septic shock of 32.1, with 87.5% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. The AUC for predicting death using VRI was 95% (95% CI 90% to 100%, p<0.001) and PELOD-2 92.6% (95% CI 96.4% to 98.8%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The VRI <32.1\u2009may potentially be used to predict mortality in children with septic shock and its predictive ability is as good as PELOD-2. The assessment of VRI is faster and easier than PELOD-2.",

        "abstract": "Almost 50% of the infertility cases are due to male factors. Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) allow to overcome the incapacity of these patients' spermatozoa to fertilize the oocyte and produce a viable and healthy offspring, but the efficiency of the different techniques has still the potential to improve. According to the latest reports of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC), the percentages of deliveries per ART cycle in 2014 and 2016 were 21 and 22%, respectively. Among the reasons for this relatively low efficiency, the quality of the spermatozoa has been pointed out as critical, and the presence of high percentages of DNA-damaged spermatozoa in patients' ejaculates is possibly one of the main factors reducing the ARTs outcomes. Thus, one of the main challenges in reproductive medicine is to ensure the highest quality of the spermatozoa used in ARTs, and specifically, in terms of genetic integrity. The latest techniques for the preparation and selection of human spermatozoa are herein discussed focusing on those proven to improve one or several of the following parameters: sperm genetic integrity, fertilization capacity, embryo production, and ",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Sepsis recognition is a clinical challenge in children. We aim to determine whether peripheral blood gene expression profiles are associated with pathogen type and sepsis severity in children with suspected sepsis. METHODS: This was a prospective pilot observational study in a tertiary pediatric emergency department with a convenience sample of children enrolled. Participants were older than 56 days and younger than 18 years, had suspected sepsis, and had not received broad-spectrum antibiotics in the previous 4 hours. Primary outcome was source pathogen, defined as confirmed bacterial source from sterile body fluid or confirmed viral source. Secondary outcome was sepsis severity, defined as maximum therapy required for shock reversal in the first 3 hospital days. We drew peripheral blood for ribonucleic acid isolation at the sepsis protocol activation, obtained gene expression measures with the GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array, and conducted differential expression analysis. RESULTS: We collected ribonucleic acid samples from a convenience sample of 122 children with suspected sepsis and 12 healthy controls. We compared the 66 children (54%) with confirmed bacterial or viral infection and found 558 differentially expressed genes, many related to interferon signaling or viral immunity. We did not find statistically significant gene expression differences in patients according to sepsis severity. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates feasibility of evaluating gene expression profiling data in children evaluated for sepsis in the pediatric emergency department setting. Our results suggest that gene expression profiling may facilitate identification of source pathogen in children with suspected sepsis, which could ultimately lead to improved tailoring of sepsis treatment and antimicrobial stewardship.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency of primary multiple organ failure and the role of sepsis as a causative agent in critically ill pediatric patients; and calculate and evaluate the accuracy of the Pediatric Risk of Mortality III (PRISM III) and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) scores to predict the outcomes of critically ill children. METHODS: Retrospective study, which evaluated data from patients admitted from January to December 2011 in the pediatric intensive care unit of the Children's Hospital of the University of Cairo. RESULTS: Out of 237 patients in the study, 72% had multiple organ dysfunctions, and 45% had sepsis with multiple organ dysfunctions. The mortality rate in patients with multiple organ dysfunction was 73%. Independent risk factors for death were mechanical ventilation and neurological failure [OR: 36 and 3.3, respectively]. The PRISM III score was more accurate than the PELOD score in predicting death, with a Hosmer-Lemeshow X2 (Chi-square value) of 7.3 (df = 8, p = 0.5). The area under the curve was 0.723 for PRISM III and 0.78 for PELOD. CONCLUSION: A multiple organ dysfunctions was associated with high mortality. Sepsis was the major cause. Pneumonia, diarrhea and central nervous system infections were the major causes of sepsis. PRISM III had a better calibration than the PELOD for prognosis of the patients, despite the high frequency of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

        "abstract": "An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7th Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD \u00b1 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged .16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged .15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called 'invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised riskbehaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the \"invisible\" risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.",
