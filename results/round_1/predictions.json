        "title": "Modifying effects of prenatal exposure to rare earth elements on birth outcomes through maternal thyroid function in early pregnancy.",
        "abstract": "The potential health effects of exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) remain largely unexplored. This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, -0.002). Furthermore, gender-specific analyses revealed significant associations between REE exposure and TPOAb levels among female neonates. Mediation analyses indicated that TSH significantly mediated the relationships between Terbium (Tb) and Y exposure and neonatal birth outcomes. The study suggests that REEs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly thyroid hormones, which could adversely affect neonatal growth, highlighting the need for further research on their impact in vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The involvement of B-cells in multiple sclerosis has only recently emerged. Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the B-cell antigen CD20 with enhanced B-cell targeting. AREAS COVERED: This evaluation is of the identical ULTIMATE (UbLiTuximab In Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Effects) I and II trials comparing ublituximab (TG-1101) and teriflunomide in relapsing multiple sclerosis. The primary efficacy end point was the annualized relapse rate and was lower in the ublituximab than the teriflunomide group. EXPERT OPINION: The continuation rates to oral teriflunomide in ULTIMATE were higher than in other trials, possibly because of the supervised double-dummy protocol used with intravenous ublituximab. This may have contributed to the higher efficacy with teriflunomide in this trial than previously reported. Nevertheless, ublituximab was more effective than teriflunomide at reducing the annualized relapse rates and MRI endpoints, but not for no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the ULTIMATE trials did show that ublituximab was superior to teriflunomide in NEDA. Long-term studies of the adverse effects of ublituximab are required. Despite the positive results from ULTIMATE for ublituximab, it is still under the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and conclusions should await their findings.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sleeping sickness, or human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), is transmitted by tsetse flies in endemic foci in sub-Saharan Africa. Because of international travel and population movements, cases are also occasionally diagnosed in non-endemic countries. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Antitrypanosomal medicines to treat the disease are available gratis through the World Health Organization (WHO) thanks to a public-private partnership, and exclusive distribution of the majority of them enables WHO to gather information on all exported cases. Data collected by WHO are complemented by case reports and scientific publications. During 2011-2020, 49 cases of HAT were diagnosed in 16 non-endemic countries across five continents: 35 cases were caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, mainly in tourists visiting wildlife areas in eastern and southern Africa, and 14 cases were due to T. b. gambiense, mainly in African migrants originating from or visiting endemic areas in western and central Africa. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: HAT diagnosis in non-endemic countries is rare and can be challenging, but alertness and surveillance must be maintained to contribute to WHO's elimination goals. Early detection is particularly important as it considerably improves the prognosis.",

        "title": "Genomic mechanisms of fatigue in survivors of colorectal cancer.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many cancer survivors experience fatigue as a nagging symptom lasting years after treatment. To learn of the relevant biological pathways involved in fatigue among cancer survivors, the authors tested for an association between fatigue levels and leukocyte gene expression profiles and determined the specific mediating immune cell types. METHODS: A sample of 89 Hispanic/Latino adults aged 60.5 years, 62% of whom were male, who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer and were 2.9 years since diagnosis provided blood for transcriptome profiling and completed a validated measure of fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form). The authors applied genome-wide transcriptional profiling of leukocyte RNA to identify gene expression activity associated with fatigue, tested for the activity of specific transcription factors involved in previously established markers of inflammation and immunologic activation, and identified the specific cell types mediating these transcriptional alterations. RESULTS: In analyses adjusting for demographic and behavioral health risk factors, results linked fatigue with increased activation of B lymphocytes and CD8-positive T cells, as well as several transcription factors involved in immune activation (nuclear factor \u03baB [NF-\u03baB], signal transducer and activator of transcription [STAT], and cAMP responsive element-binding protein [CREB]). Results also replicated several specific genomic effects previously observed in fatigued cancer survivors, including upregulated expression of \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA) and hemoglobin subunits (HBA and HBB). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors' heightened fatigue levels may be partially explained by activation of specific immune cell subsets, thereby providing a potential molecular biomarker for clinical interventions targeting the remediation of fatigue.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: To determine if a set of time-varying biological indicators can be used to: 1) predict the sepsis mortality risk over time and 2) generate mortality risk profiles. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Nine Canadian ICUs. SUBJECTS: Three-hundred fifty-six septic patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical data and plasma levels of biomarkers were collected longitudinally. We used a complementary log-log model to account for the daily mortality risk of each patient until death in ICU/hospital, discharge, or 28 days after admission. The model, which is a versatile version of the Cox model for gaining longitudinal insights, created a composite indicator (the daily hazard of dying) from the \"day 1\" and \"change\" variables of six time-varying biological indicators (cell-free DNA, protein C, platelet count, creatinine, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and lactate) and a set of contextual variables (age, presence of chronic lung disease or previous brain injury, and duration of stay), achieving a high predictive power (conventional area under the curve, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94). Including change variables avoided misleading inferences about the effects of day 1 variables, signifying the importance of the longitudinal approach. We then generated mortality risk profiles that highlight the relative contributions among the time-varying biological indicators to overall mortality risk. The tool was validated in 28 nonseptic patients from the same ICUs who became septic later and was subject to 10-fold cross-validation, achieving similarly high area under the curve. CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel version of the Cox model, we created a prognostic tool for septic patients that yields not only a predicted probability of dying but also a mortality risk profile that reveals how six time-varying biological indicators differentially and longitudinally account for the patient's overall daily mortality risk.",

        "abstract": "The interactions between tubulointerstitial infiltrating cells and the extracellular matrix play an important role in regulating renal fibrosis. Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a nonintegrin tyrosine kinase receptor for collagen implicated in cell adhesion, proliferation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. We have previously demonstrated that transgenic mice lacking DDR1 are protected from hypertension-associated renal fibrosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of DDR1 in renal inflammation and fibrosis related to primitive tubulointerstitial injury. After 12 days of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), kidney histopathologic and real-time quantitative PCR analyses were performed in DDR1(-/-) and wild-type mice. DDR1 expression was strongly increased in the obstructed kidney. Wild-type mice developed important perivascular and interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. In comparison, DDR1(-/-) mice displayed reduced accumulation of fibrillar collagen and transforming growth factor \u03b2 expression. F4/80(+) cell count and proinflammatory cytokines were remarkably blunted in DDR1(-/-) obstructed kidneys. Leukocyte rolling and adhesion evaluated by intravital microscopy were not different between DDR1(-/-) and wild-type mice. Importantly, macrophages isolated from DDR1(-/-) mice presented similar M1/M2 polarization but displayed impaired migration in response to monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Together, these data suggest that DDR1 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of renal disease via enhanced inflammation. Inhibition of DDR1 expression or activity may represent a novel therapeutic target against the progression of renal diseases.",

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal, progressive disease of the motor system. Most approved treatments have a modest effect on disease progression. Tofersen is a recently approved medication that acts by reducing a toxic protein found in a particular form of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This is an overview of the published clinical data for tofersen as well as some background information about tofersen and other treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.What were the results? Treatment with tofersen reduced levels of the target protein and markers of nervous system damage.

        "abstract": "Analytic morphomics refers to the accurate measurement of specific biological markers of human body composition in diagnostic medical imaging. The increasing prevalence of disease processes that alter body composition including obesity, cachexia, and sarcopenia has generated interest in specific targeted measurement of these metrics to possibly prevent or reduce negative health outcomes. Typical morphomic measurements include the area and density of muscle, bone, vascular calcification, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat on a specific validated axial level in the patient's cross-sectional diagnostic imaging. A distinct advantage of these measurements is that they can be made retrospectively and opportunistically with pre-existing datasets. We provide a narrative review of the current state of art in morphomics, but also consider some potential future directions for this exciting field. Imaging based quantitative assessment of body composition has enormous potential across the breadth and scope of modern clinical practice. From risk stratification to treatment planning, and outcome assessment, all can be enhanced with the use of analytic morphomics. Moreover, it is likely that many new opportunities for personalized medicine will emerge as the field evolves. As radiologists, embracing analytic morphomics will enable us to contribute added value in the care of every patient.",

        "abstract": "Unintended pregnancy is a global public health problem. Despite a variety of female contraceptive options, male contraceptive options are limited to the condom and vasectomy. Condoms have high failure rates and surgical vasectomy is not reliably reversible. There is a global need and desire for novel male contraceptive methods. Hormonal methods have progressed the furthest in clinical development and androgen plus progestin formulations hold promise as a marketable, reversible male contraceptive over the next decade. Investigators have tested androgen plus progestin approaches using oral, transdermal, subdermal, and injectable drug formulations and demonstrated the short-term safety and reversibility of hormonal male contraception. The most commonly reported side effects associated with hormonal male contraception include weight gain, acne, slight suppression of serum high-density cholesterol, mood changes, and changes in libido. Efficacy trials of hormonal male contraceptives have demonstrated contraceptive efficacy rates greater than that of condoms. Although there has been less progression in the development of nonhormonal male contraceptives, potentially reversible vaso-occlusive methods are currently in clinical trials in some countries. Various studies have confirmed both men and women's desire for novel male contraceptives. Barriers to development include an absence of investment from pharmaceutical companies, concerns regarding side effects and spermatogenic rebound with hormonal methods, and lack of clear reversibility and proven effectiveness of nonhormonal methods. The ultimate availability of male contraceptives could have an important impact on decreasing global unintended pregnancy rates (currently 40% of all pregnancies) and will be a step towards reproductive justice and greater equity in family planning.",

METHODS: The descriptive study was conducted on 278 children with SLD. Strengths and difficulties in children were evaluated by the SDQ applied to their mothers. The percentage of cases above the cut-off limits of the SDQ was calculated. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis were used for analysis. RESULTS: The mean (SD) total SDQ score was 15.8 (6.5). The percentage of scores of abnormal total difficulties in SLD was 47.8%. Multivariate analysis revealed that cases exposed to antenatal smoking had higher odds ratio of abnormal emotional symptoms and abnormal total difficulties; cases with poor familial income and the presence of a history of antenatal smoking exposure showed considerably higher odds ratio of conduct problems; cases with younger age at the diagnosis of SLD, dyscalculia, extreme duration of preschool screen time (\u22654\u00a0h), and history of hospitalization had significantly higher odds ratio for hyperactivity-inattention problems; and cases having shorter breastfeeding duration had higher odds ratio of peer problems compared to counterparts. CONCLUSION: Children with SLD have a high score on the SDQ. Practitioners could especially give guidance and support to families with financial problems and those having a child with an early age at diagnosis, exposure to antenatal smoking, short breastfeeding period, early age of the first screen use, and long screen exposure duration during the preschool period.",

This information was gathered through a comprehensive literature review along with using first hand institutional experience. Due to the potential severe toxicities related to CAR-T cell therapy, safe practices and monitoring are key. These authors demonstrate that nurses have a profound responsibility in preparing and caring for patients and families, monitoring and managing side effects in these patients, ensuring that study guidelines are followed, and providing continuity for patients, families, and referring providers. Education of nurses is crucial for improved patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in incidence, etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture confirmed infections in hospitalized infants in a large tertiary neonatal unit in South Africa. METHODS: Single-center, retrospective review of laboratory records of bacteria and fungi, and their susceptibility profiles, isolated from blood and CSF of infants hospitalized in the neonatal unit at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa, from 1st January 2010 to 31st December 2019. Laboratory data on isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were collected. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Corynebacteria and Bacillus spp. were excluded. Patient-level clinical and laboratory data were not available. RESULTS: There were 8,319 significant isolates, giving an infection rate of 14.3/1000 patient-days. Infection rates increased from 12.0 to 15.7/1000 patient-days (estimated average yearly change 0.6[95%CI, 0.5-0.7];p = <0.001). Gram-negative infection rates increased from 4.3 to 10.8/1000 patient-days (estimated average yearly change 0.7[95%CI,0.6-0.8];p = <0.001). The 2 most commonly isolated Gram-negative organisms were Acinetobacter baumannii (44%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (39%). Carbapenem resistance was seen in 31% of all Gram-negatives and increased over time (estimated average yearly change 4.8%[95%CI,4.2%-5.3%];p<0.001). Gram-positive infection rates decreased (estimated average yearly change -0.1[95%CI,-0.2- -0.05];p = <0.001). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram-positive isolated. Rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus decreased from 91% to 55%(estimated average yearly change -2.8%[95%CI,-3.5%-2%],p< 0.001). Rates of fungal isolates decreased (estimated average yearly change -0.06[95%CI,-0.1 --0.02]);p = 0.007). Candida parapsilosis (52%) and Candida albicans (35%) were the most common fungi isolated. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a marked overall increase in rates of blood and/or CSF infections, with an absolute increase in Gram-negative infections observed, replacing Gram-positive and fungal pathogens. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase Gram-negative isolates are being replaced by carbapenem resistance, with around one third of all significant Gram-negative isolates now carbapenem resistant. Research into hospital based novel treatment and prevention interventions for neonatal sepsis should be urgently prioritized.",

        "title": "Analysis and validation of diagnostic biomarkers and immune cell infiltration characteristics in pediatric sepsis by integrating bioinformatics and machine learning.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pediatric sepsis is a complicated condition characterized by life-threatening organ failure resulting from a dysregulated host response to infection in children. It is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, and rapid detection and administration of antimicrobials have been emphasized. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic biomarkers of pediatric sepsis and the function of immune cell infiltration in the development of this illness. METHODS: Three gene expression datasets were available from the Gene Expression Omnibus collection. First, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found with the use of the R program, and then gene set enrichment analysis was carried out. Subsequently, the DEGs were combined with the major module genes chosen using the weighted gene co-expression network. The hub genes were identified by the use of three machine-learning algorithms: random forest, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The receiver operating characteristic curve and nomogram model were used to verify the discrimination and efficacy of the hub genes. In addition, the inflammatory and immune status of pediatric sepsis was assessed using cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT). The relationship between the diagnostic markers and infiltrating immune cells was further studied. RESULTS: Overall, after overlapping key module genes and DEGs, we detected 402 overlapping genes. As pediatric sepsis diagnostic indicators, CYSTM1 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.988), MMP8 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.973), and CD177 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.986) were investigated and demonstrated statistically significant differences (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and diagnostic efficacy in the validation set. As indicated by the immune cell infiltration analysis, multiple immune cells may be involved in the development of pediatric sepsis. Additionally, all diagnostic characteristics may correlate with immune cells to varying degrees. CONCLUSIONS: The candidate hub genes (CD177, CYSTM1, and MMP8) were identified, and the nomogram was constructed for pediatric sepsis diagnosis. Our study could provide potential peripheral blood diagnostic candidate genes for pediatric sepsis patients.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Testing safety of Delta24-RGD (DNX-2401), an oncolytic adenovirus, locally delivered by convection enhanced delivery (CED) in tumor and surrounding brain of patients with recurrent glioblastoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dose-escalation phase I study with 3+3 cohorts, dosing 107 to 1 \u00d7 1011 viral particles (vp) in 20 patients. Besides clinical parameters, adverse events, and radiologic findings, blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain interstitial fluid, and excreta were sampled over time and analyzed for presence of immune response, viral replication, distribution, and shedding. RESULTS: Of 20 enrolled patients, 19 received the oncolytic adenovirus Delta24-RGD, which was found to be safe and feasible. Four patients demonstrated tumor response on MRI, one with complete regression and still alive after 8 years. Most serious adverse events were attributed to increased intracranial pressure caused by either an inflammatory reaction responding to steroid treatment or viral meningitis being transient and self-limiting. Often viral DNA concentrations in CSF increased over time, peaking after 2 to 4 weeks and remaining up to 3 months. Concomitantly Th1- and Th2-associated cytokine levels and numbers of CD3+ T and natural killer cells increased. Posttreatment tumor specimens revealed increased numbers of macrophages and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. No evidence of viral shedding in excreta was observed. CONCLUSIONS: CED of Delta24-RGD not only in the tumor but also in surrounding brain is safe, induces a local inflammatory reaction, and shows promising clinical responses.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations of demographic, clinical, laboratory, organ dysfunction, and illness severity variable values with: 1) sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock in children with infection and 2) multiple organ dysfunction or death in children with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms \"sepsis,\" \"septicemia,\" or \"septic shock\" in the title or abstract. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Strong associations of several markers of organ dysfunction with the outcomes of interest among infected and septic children support their inclusion in the data validation phase of the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce.",

METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library up to the 1st of January 2021. We included studies that assessed neonatal sepsis and the following outcomes; (1) change in the metabolism compared to healthy neonates and/or (2) metabolomics compared to traditional diagnostic tools of neonatal sepsis. The screened abstracts were independently considered for eligibility by two researchers. PROSPERO ID: CRD42020164454. RESULTS: The search identified in total 762 articles. Fifteen articles were assessed for eligibility. Four studies were included, with totally 78 neonates. The studies used different diagnostic criteria and had between 1 and 16 sepsis cases. All studies with bacterial sepsis found alterations in the glucose and lactate metabolism, reflecting possible redistribution of glucose consumption from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to the lactate and pentose phosphate pathway. We also found signs of increased oxidative stress and fatty acid oxidation in sepsis cases. CONCLUSION: We found signs of metabolomic signatures in neonatal sepsis. This may lead to better understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and detection of new candidate biomarkers. Results should be validated in large-scale multicentre studies.",

        "abstract": "Infants with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) continue to have significantly worse outcomes compared with older children with B-ALL, and those with relapsed or refractory (R/R) infant ALL have especially dismal outcomes with conventional treatment. CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in the treatment of R/R childhood B-ALL, although the majority of reports have been in noninfant patients. Barriers to the successful implementation of CAR T-cell therapy in infant B-ALL include challenges related to apheresis, product manufacturing, and disease-specific considerations such as lineage switch. We describe our experience using 2 experimental CD19 CAR T-cell products, SCRI-CAR19 or SCRI-CAR19x22, for 19 patients with R/R infant B-ALL enrolled in 3 clinical trials. CAR T-cell products were successfully manufactured in 18 of 19 (94.7%) patients, with a median age of 22.5\u00a0months at enrollment (range, 14.5-40.1). Of 17 (94.1%) treated patients, 16 achieved a complete remission without detectable minimal residual disease. The 1-year leukemia-free survival was 75%, and 1-year overall survival was 76.5%, with a median follow-up time of 35.8\u00a0months (range, 1.7-83.6). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 14 of 17 (82.4%) patients, with only 1 patient experiencing grade 3 CRS. Neurotoxicity occurred in 2 of 17 (11.8%) patients with all events grade \u22642. With the successful early clinical experience of CAR T-cell therapy in this population, more systematic evaluation specific to infant ALL is warranted.",

        "title": "Two subtle problems with overrepresentation analysis.",
        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Overrepresentation analysis (ORA) is used widely to assess the enrichment of functional categories in a gene list compared to a background list. ORA is therefore a critical method in the interpretation of 'omics data, relating gene lists to biological functions and themes. Although ORA is hugely popular, we and others have noticed two potentially undesired behaviours of some ORA tools. The first one we call the 'background problem', because it involves the software eliminating large numbers of genes from the background list if they are not annotated as belonging to any category. The second one we call the 'false discovery rate problem', because some tools underestimate the true number of parallel tests conducted. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate the impact of these issues on several real RNA-seq datasets and use simulated RNA-seq data to quantify the impact of these problems. We show that the severity of these problems depends on the gene set library, the number of genes in the list, and the degree of noise in the dataset. These problems can be mitigated by changing packages/websites for ORA or by changing to another approach such as functional class scoring.

        "title": "Clinical Implementation and Evaluation of Three Implementation Interventions for a Family-Oriented Care for Children of Mentally Ill Parents (ci-chimps): Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Multicenter Trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Germany, approximately three million children under the age of eighteen have a mentally ill parent. These children are at an increased risk of developing a mental illness themselves (1) as well as a physical illness (2). While research has identified numerous evidence-based family-oriented interventions, little is known about how to implement such interventions effectively and efficiently in clinical practice in Germany. This implementation study (ci-chimps) evaluates three clinical implementation projects with three different implementation interventions for the optimal implementation of the tailored family-oriented preventive and therapeutic interventions in the CHIMPS-NET (children of mentally ill parents-research network) with an implementation model for children of mentally ill parents. METHODS: A two-group randomized controlled multicenter trial will examine changes in family-oriented practice and aspects of implementation at baseline as well as at 12- and 24-months follow-up. The CHIMPS-Network consists of 20 clinical centers. The centers in the intervention group receive the support of all of the three implementation interventions: (1) optimal pathways to care, (2) education and a training program for professionals, and (3) systematic screening for children. The centers in the control group do not receive this specific implementation support. DISCUSSION: While we know that children of mentally ill parents are an important target group to be addressed by preventive and therapeutic interventions, there is often a lack of structured implementation of family-oriented interventions in clinical practice in Germany. Using a randomized controlled multicenter trial design with a large and wide-ranging sample (clinics for adult psychiatry and clinics for child and adolescent psychiatry, university clinics and clinics at the real health care) will provide a robust understanding of implementing family-oriented changes in German clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The CHIMPS-NET-study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register on 2019-12-19 (DRKS00020380) and with Clinical Trials on 2020-4-30 (NCT04369625), the ci-chimps-study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00026217) on 2021-08-27, the Clinical Trials registration is in review process.",

METHODS: A population-based retrospective epidemiological study including infants with GPB-BSI, admitted to the neonatal units at Karolinska University Hospital (KUH). Data were collected from patient records, the Swedish Neonatal Quality Register, the microbiological laboratory at KUH and the Swedish Public Health Agency. RESULTS: We identified 357 infants with GPB-BSI, representing an incidence of 1.47/1000 live births (LB). Group B streptococcus (GBS) was the most common pathogen causing BSI in full-term infants and early-onset sepsis (EOS) (0.20/1000 LB), while coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were predominant in infants born very preterm and in late-onset sepsis (LOS) (0.79/1000 LB). There were no fatal GBS BSI cases, but 10.2% developed meningitis. The GPB case fatality rate was 9.5% and the sepsis fatality rate 2.8%. In GPB-BSI, 1/10 did not have an elevated C-reactive protein level. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) BSI increased during the study period, but no methicillin or vancomycin resistant strains were found. The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rate was highest in CoNS isolates. CONCLUSION: GPB-BSI was four times more common than Gram-negative BSI in neonates but resulted in lower mortality rate. GBS was the most common pathogen in full-term infants and in EOS. CoNS was the most common pathogen in LOS and infants born very preterm, and the AMR rate was high in these isolates. The increasing trend of S. aureus BSI indicates a need of further investigation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increases in the prevalence of depression, anxiety and behavioural problems among children and youth. Less well understood is the influence of the pandemic on antidepressant and antipsychotic use among children. This is important, as it is possible that antidepressants and antipsychotics were used as a \"stop-gap\" measure to treat mental health symptoms when in-person access to outpatient care and school-based supportive services was disrupted. Furthermore, antipsychotics and antidepressants have been associated with harm in children and youth. We examined trends in dispensing of these medications two years following the pandemic among children 18 years of age and under in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We conducted a population-based time-series study of antidepressant and antipsychotic medication dispensing to children and adolescents \u226418 years old between September 1, 2014, and March 31, 2022. We measured monthly population-adjusted rates of antidepressant and antipsychotics obtained from the IQVIA Geographic Prescription Monitor (GPM) database. We used structural break analyses to identify the pandemic month(s) when changes in the dispensing of antidepressants and antipsychotics occurred. We used interrupted time series models to quantify changes in dispensing following the structural break and compare observed and expected use of these drugs. RESULTS: Overall, we found higher-than-expected dispensing of antidepressants and antipsychotics in children and youth. Specifically, we observed an immediate step decrease in antidepressant dispensing associated with a structural break in April 2020 (-55.8 units per 1,000 individuals; 95% confidence intervals [CI] CI: -117.4 to 5.8), followed by an increased monthly trend in the rate of antidepressant dispensing of 13.0 units per 1,000 individuals (95% CI: 10.2-15.9). Antidepressant dispensing was consistently greater than predicted from September 2020 onward. Antipsychotic dispensing increased immediately following a June 2020 structural break (26.4 units per 1,000 individuals; 95% CI: 15.8-36.9) and did not change appreciably thereafter. Antipsychotic dispensing was higher than predicted at all time points from June 2020 onward. CONCLUSION: We found higher-than-expected dispensing of antidepressants and antipsychotics in children and youth. These increases were sustained through nearly two years of observation and are especially concerning in light of the potential for harm with the long-term use of antipsychotics in children. Further research is required to understand the clinical implications of these findings.",

        "abstract": "Cannabis is one of the most commonly used and abused illicit drugs in the world today. The United States (US) currently has the highest annual prevalence rate of cannabis consumption in the world, 17.9% in individuals aged 12 or older, and it is on the rise. With increasing cannabis use comes the potential for an increase in abuse, and according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), approximately 5.1% of Americans had Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) in 2020. Research has shown that genetics and epigenetics play a significant role in cannabis use and CUD. In fact, approximately 50-70% of liability to CUD and 40-48% of cannabis use initiation have been found to be the result of genetic factors. Cannabis usage and CUD have also been linked to an increased risk of psychiatric disorders and Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) subsets like schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. Comprehension of the genetic and epigenetic aspects of cannabinoids is necessary for future research, treatment plans, and the production of pure cannabinoid compounds, which will be essential for FDA approval. In conclusion, having a better understanding of the epigenetic and genetic underpinnings of cannabis use, CUD, and the endocannabinoid system as a whole will aid in the development of effective FDA-approved treatment therapies and the advancement of personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has dramatically altered the landscape of treatment options available to children and adults with ALL. With complete remission induction rates exceeding 70% in most trials and FDA approval of one CD19 CAR T-cell construct in ALL, CAR T-cell therapy has become a mainstay in the ALL treatment algorithm for those with relapsed/refractory disease. Despite the high remission induction rate, with growing experience using CAR T-cell therapy in ALL, a host of barriers to maintaining long-term durable remissions have been identified. Specifically, relapse after, resistance to, or loss of long-term CAR T-cell persistence may all hinder CAR T-cell efficacy. In this review, we provide an overview of the current limitations which inform the design of the next generation of CAR T-cells and discuss advances in CAR T-cell engineering aimed to improve upon outcomes with CAR T-cell-based therapy in ALL.",

        "title": "Phoenix criteria for sepsis: are these enough to guide a clinician?",
        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. There is a paucity of data on the criteria used to define sepsis and septic shock and predict mortality. Schlapbach et al. published Phoenix criteria to define sepsis in JAMA in 2024. Previously, paediatricians have used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, but these criteria lack sensitivity and specificity. This group recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Though included in the 8-point criteria, important criteria like renal and liver are missing from the main criteria. We remain worried about the way these criteria got excluded from the main criteria. Therefore, in this brief report, whilst commending the authors for this stelar task, we highlight the main pitfalls in these criteria especially the renal, neurologic, and liver criteria. These criteria have been shown to be independently associated with outcomes, and we recommend that in the future iterations of the criteria, renal and liver criteria should be defined according to latest definitions and the task force consider utilizing latest criteria for each organ system involved within the formulated criteria. CONCLUSION: \u00a0In conclusion, Phoenix criteria are a step in the right direction to define life-threatening organ dysfunction in sepsis, but clinicians need to be mindful that diagnosis/treatment of less severe sepsis should not be delayed if these criteria are not met. Therefore, local early detection and management tools for sepsis should be followed. WHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 There has always been a quest for a definition for pediatric sepsis. There are limitations to the previous pediatric sepsis criteria which were published in 2005 by the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC). IPSCC defines sepsis as a suspected or confirmed infection in the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). These new Phoenix Pediatric Sepsis (PPS) criteria for sepsis and septic shock are intended to identify children with life-threatening organ dysfunction due to infection, and the score was developed based on a very large pediatric dataset. WHAT IS NEW: \u2022 Though the intention of Phoenix criteria is to help identify children with life threatening organ dysfunction, unfortunately the crietria will miss signs of early sepis. In this manuscript, we point out some of the drawbacks of these criteria which need to be borne in mind while applying these criteria.",

The aim is to find out if HPOT and SHPOT produce the same effects on balance, gross motor function, and postural control in children under 18 years old with cerebral palsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The keywords used were: hippotherapy, equine-assisted therapy and cerebral palsy. The databases used were PeDro, Scopus, LILACS, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and CINAHL Complete (Ebsco). Studies were included if they were randomized clinical trials that studied the effect of HPOT and/or SHPOT on the variables mentioned in these patients. RESULTS: Four studies assessed balance, 4 studied gross motor function, and 2 investigated postural control. Both HPOT and SHPOT produced benefits in all of them. CONCLUSIONS: According to the studied variables both interventions produce similar improvements. Although, they increase with HPOT possibly due to greater sensory stimulation.",

        "abstract": "The present study examined genetic, prenatal, and postnatal environmental pathways in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and depressive symptoms from parents to early adolescents (when these symptoms start to increase), while considering timing effects of exposure to parent anxiety and depressive symptoms postnatally. The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Overrepresentation analysis (ORA) is used widely to assess the enrichment of functional categories in a gene list compared to a background list. ORA is therefore a critical method in the interpretation of 'omics data, relating gene lists to biological functions and themes. Although ORA is hugely popular, we and others have noticed two potentially undesired behaviours of some ORA tools. The first one we call the 'background problem', because it involves the software eliminating large numbers of genes from the background list if they are not annotated as belonging to any category. The second one we call the 'false discovery rate problem', because some tools underestimate the true number of parallel tests conducted. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate the impact of these issues on several real RNA-seq datasets and use simulated RNA-seq data to quantify the impact of these problems. We show that the severity of these problems depends on the gene set library, the number of genes in the list, and the degree of noise in the dataset. These problems can be mitigated by changing packages/websites for ORA or by changing to another approach such as functional class scoring.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess Gram-positive bacterial (GPB) bloodstream infection (BSI) in neonates, covering incidence, morbidity, mortality, antimicrobial resistance patterns and biomarkers in Region Stockholm, Sweden between 2006 and 2016. METHODS: A population-based retrospective epidemiological study including infants with GPB-BSI, admitted to the neonatal units at Karolinska University Hospital (KUH). Data were collected from patient records, the Swedish Neonatal Quality Register, the microbiological laboratory at KUH and the Swedish Public Health Agency. RESULTS: We identified 357 infants with GPB-BSI, representing an incidence of 1.47/1000 live births (LB). Group B streptococcus (GBS) was the most common pathogen causing BSI in full-term infants and early-onset sepsis (EOS) (0.20/1000 LB), while coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were predominant in infants born very preterm and in late-onset sepsis (LOS) (0.79/1000 LB). There were no fatal GBS BSI cases, but 10.2% developed meningitis. The GPB case fatality rate was 9.5% and the sepsis fatality rate 2.8%. In GPB-BSI, 1/10 did not have an elevated C-reactive protein level. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) BSI increased during the study period, but no methicillin or vancomycin resistant strains were found. The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rate was highest in CoNS isolates. CONCLUSION: GPB-BSI was four times more common than Gram-negative BSI in neonates but resulted in lower mortality rate. GBS was the most common pathogen in full-term infants and in EOS. CoNS was the most common pathogen in LOS and infants born very preterm, and the AMR rate was high in these isolates. The increasing trend of S. aureus BSI indicates a need of further investigation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare, life-threatening, genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. Treatment in RTT encounters many challenges. Trofinetide, a modified amino-terminal tripeptide of insulin-like growth factor 1, has demonstrated clinically promising results in RTT. In this study, trofinetide efficacy and safety in RTT are systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed. METHODS: A systematic search of five electronic databases was conducted until January 2024. Review Manager 5.4 software was used for the analysis. The analysis was based on a weighted mean difference and standard error with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, and a statistically significant P-value was considered if it was\u2009<\u20090.05. The study was registered on PROSPERO with registration number CRD42024499849. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS: Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 276 patients were included in the analysis. Trofinetide improved both caregiver outcomes and clinical scales by improving the Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ) (mean difference (MD):\u2009-\u20093.46 points, 95% CI:\u2009-\u20095.63 to\u2009-\u20091.27, P\u2009=\u20090.0002) and Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I) (MD:\u2009-\u20090.35, 95% CI:\u2009-\u20090.51 to\u2009-\u20090.18, P\u2009<\u20090.0001), respectively. However, trofinetide neither improved the Caregiver Top 3 Concerns Visual Analog Scale nor the Rett Motor Behavioral Assessment. Regarding safety, trofinetide was significantly associated with vomiting compared to placebo (odds ratio (OR): 3.17, 95% CI: 1.57 to 6.43, P\u2009=\u20090.001). After solving heterogeneity, results showed a statistically significant incidence of diarrhea in the trofinetide (200\u00a0mg) group compared to placebo (OR: 18.51, 95% CI: 9.30 to 36.84, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Trofinetide demonstrated statistically significant improvements in CGI-I and RSBQ in pediatrics and adult patients with Rett. Side effects are limited to vomiting and diarrhea. Although diarrhea yielded an insignificant result in our analysis, it emerged as a cause for treatment discontinuation in the participating trials, and a statistically significant risk for diarrhea emerged when excluding the study using a lower dose of the drug, hence causing heterogeneity, in the\u00a0meta-analysis. Given the diverse genetic landscape of RTT, future RCTs investigating correlations between RTT genotype and phenotypic improvements by trofinetide will be beneficial. RCTs encompassing male patients with larger and longer cohorts are recommended.",

METHODS: We examined the frequency of reported AEs by male research participants compared with AEs reported in prescribing information of approved female hormonal contraceptive methods. Published data from trials of the top five most-used female hormonal contraceptives, supplemented by contemporary contraceptive research, were compared with the frequency of AEs reported in a male injectable hormonal contraceptive trial. RESULTS: We observed similar frequencies of AEs reported by users of male contraceptives compared with those reported by female users. Among quantitatively comparable AEs, compared with men, women reported experiencing higher frequencies of headaches, pelvic pain, and weight gain and similar frequencies of decreased libido. Compared with women, men reported experiencing higher frequencies of acne and mood changes. Men discontinued participation due to AEs at a lower frequency than women. CONCLUSIONS: Female hormonal methods generally have similar frequencies of AEs to those reported in a recent male hormonal contraceptive trial, and male users had lower rates of discontinuation due to AEs. There were fewer serious AEs of the male contraceptive than reported in contemporary female trials which resulted in FDA licensure. This suggests there may be implicit bias in the scientific community regarding the level of acceptable risk for users of male contraceptive methods.",

        "title": "Sequential organ failure assessment scores to predict outcomes: from adults to neonates.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Organ dysfunction severity scores (sequential organ failure assessment or SOFA) are commonly used in the adult and pediatric populations when assessing risk of mortality and adverse outcomes from sepsis. In contrast to sepsis definition in adults and children, clinical and laboratory criteria for defining neonatal sepsis have been inconclusive. More recently, studies have attempted to better understand the clinical progression of neonatal sepsis and associated mortality. This data has guided the development of a neonatal SOFA (nSOFA) score, based on common patterns of organ dysfunction observed in this population. RECENT FINDINGS: Although SOFA scores in the adult and pediatric populations have their limitations with moderate sensitivities and specificities depending on the clinical setting, the nSOFA score has been validated in predicting sepsis attributable mortality in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants across several patient cohorts. Furthermore, the nSOFA score has been adapted for use in neonatal disease states, other than sepsis, with similar prognostic utility. SUMMARY: Utilizing an nSOFA scoring system for prediction of sepsis attributable mortality in preterm infants allows for targeted interventions based on risk stratification, as well as better delineation of neonatal sepsis with subsequent improvements in research and patient safety outcomes.",

        "abstract": "A 74-year-old woman with ankylosing spondylitis presented with back pain and complete paraplegia after a fall. A radiologic finding of a bamboo spine, a characteristic feature of ankylosing spondylitis, was observed on computed tomography, along with a fracture-dislocation involving T10 and T11 (chalk-stick fracture) and compression of the descending thoracic aorta due to the caudal bony column. The patient underwent an open reduction and T8-L3 posterior fusion in the operating room. A complete cross-section of the spinal cord was observed during surgery. Post operation, a decrease in blood pressure led to a thoracotomy and thoracic endovascular aortic repair due to a crack in the descending aorta wall. Thoracolumbar fracture-dislocations, particularly in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, are characterized by instability and can be further complicated by concurrent vascular and spinal cord injuries. It is crucial therefore to recognize the potential for vascular and spinal cord injuries early on in such cases.",

However, families value improvements in a range of domains following intervention and the non-motor symptoms, comorbidities and complications of CP can potentially be targeted by cell therapies. We conducted a scoping review to describe all outcomes that have been reported in cell therapy studies for CP to date, and to examine what instruments were used to capture these. Through a systematic search we identified 54 studies comprising 2066 participants that were treated with a range of cell therapy interventions. We categorized the reported 53 unique outcome instruments and additional descriptive measures into 10 categories and 12 sub-categories. Movement and Posture was the most frequently reported outcome category, followed by Safety, however Quality of Life, and various prevalent comorbidities and complications of CP were infrequently reported. Notably, many outcome instruments used do not have evaluative properties and thus are not suitable for measuring change following intervention. We provide a number of recommendations to ensure that future trials generate high-quality outcome data that is aligned with the priorities of the CP community.",

        "title": "Fatigue in older persons: the role of nutrition.",
        "abstract": "Fatigue is defined as a symptom leading to the inability to continue functioning at the expected activity level. It is a highly prevalent symptom, challenging to frame into monodimensional pathophysiological mechanisms. As a result, fatigue is often underestimated in the clinical setting and is wrongly considered an unavoidable consequence of ageing. Several potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue have been proposed, including sleep patterns, autonomic nervous system abnormalities and biological complexity. Inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the most promising mechanisms through which malnutrition may cause fatigue. Not surprisingly, fatigue is highly prevalent in inflammatory conditions (e.g. COVID-19 infection). The nutritional status may also represent a critical factor in the development and presentation of fatigue, which may mimic the exhaustion of the individual's metabolic reserves. For example, the insufficient dietary intake of energy and proteins may determine the catabolism of body fat and muscles, disrupt the homeostatic balance and cause the onset of fatigue. It is necessary to conduct research on fatigue. By characterising its pathophysiological mechanisms, it will be possible to (1) support the design and development of targeted interventions, (2) improve the quality of life of many persons by acting on the symptom and (3) reduce the direct and indirect costs of a burdening condition typical of advancing age. In the present review, we provide an overview of the role that nutrition may play as a determinant of fatigue in older people, also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

METHODS: The descriptive study was conducted on 278 children with SLD. Strengths and difficulties in children were evaluated by the SDQ applied to their mothers. The percentage of cases above the cut-off limits of the SDQ was calculated. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis were used for analysis. RESULTS: The mean (SD) total SDQ score was 15.8 (6.5). The percentage of scores of abnormal total difficulties in SLD was 47.8%. Multivariate analysis revealed that cases exposed to antenatal smoking had higher odds ratio of abnormal emotional symptoms and abnormal total difficulties; cases with poor familial income and the presence of a history of antenatal smoking exposure showed considerably higher odds ratio of conduct problems; cases with younger age at the diagnosis of SLD, dyscalculia, extreme duration of preschool screen time (\u22654\u00a0h), and history of hospitalization had significantly higher odds ratio for hyperactivity-inattention problems; and cases having shorter breastfeeding duration had higher odds ratio of peer problems compared to counterparts. CONCLUSION: Children with SLD have a high score on the SDQ. Practitioners could especially give guidance and support to families with financial problems and those having a child with an early age at diagnosis, exposure to antenatal smoking, short breastfeeding period, early age of the first screen use, and long screen exposure duration during the preschool period.",

Prevalence and pathogen distribution of sepsis in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) vary with time and geographic location. Such information serves as a guide for selection of empirical antibiotics coverage. METHODS: This is a case series study performed by retrospective chart review of VLBW infants (birth body weight, BBW, <1500 g) in a medical center during a 5-year period from January 2005 to December 2009. Episodes of positive blood cultures, pathogen distribution and related clinical manifestations were described. RESULTS: A total of 158 episodes of sepsis were identified from 1042 VLBW infants. Sepsis rate was 152 per 1000 live births. The vast majority of infections (60.7%) were caused by Gram-positive organisms [G(+)], and overall Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (52.5%) were the most common pathogen identified. Prevalence for early-onset sepsis (EOS) was 1% and for late-onset sepsis (LOS) was 14.2%. Infants with EOS had a much higher case fatality rate than LOS (40% vs. 4.7%). Escherichia coli (40%) were the leading pathogen of EOS while CoNS (54.7%) was the leading pathogens of LOS. Overall, apnea and/or bradycardia and/or cyanosis (65.8%), poor activity (48.7%), and increased respiratory effort (43.0%) were the most common presenting features of sepsis. CONCLUSION: Unlike term infants, Gram-negative organism and E coli were the leading pathogen of EOS among VLBW infants. Judicious and timely use of antibiotic therapy is crucial in the care of VLBW infants.",

        "abstract": "Several years ago, dozens of cases were described in patients with symptoms very similar to mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). This new disease entity was described as mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome (MPSPS). The name of the disease indicates that in addition to the typical symptoms of conventional MPS, patients develop other features such as congenital heart defects and kidney and hematopoietic system disorders. The symptoms are highly advanced, and patients usually do not survive past the second year of life. MPSPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a homozygous-specific mutation in the gene encoding the VPS33A protein. To date, it has been described in 41 patients. Patients with MPSPS exhibited excessive excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the urine and exceptionally high levels of heparan sulfate in the plasma, but the accumulation of substrates is not caused by a decrease in the activity of any lysosomal enzymes. Here, we discuss the pathomechanisms and symptoms of MPSPS, comparing them to those of MPS. Moreover, we asked the question whether MPSPS should be classified as a type of MPS or a separate disease, as contrary to 'classical' MPS types, despite GAG accumulation, no defects in lysosomal enzymes responsible for degradation of these compounds could be detected in MPSPS. The molecular mechanism of the appearance of GAG accumulation in MPSPS is suggested on the basis of results available in the literature.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94\u00b71% (95% CI 90\u00b76-97\u00b77) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82\u00b72% (95% CI 76\u00b73-88\u00b71) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90\u00b75% (95% CI 83\u00b73-97\u00b76) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94\u00b77% (87\u00b78-100\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70\u00b71% (95% CI 44\u00b71-96\u00b72) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69\u00b76% (53\u00b71-86\u00b70) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pyroptosis is closely relevant to sepsis. However, the molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis in pneumonia-induced sepsis are still not fully understood. Thus, this study aimed to find the specific molecular pathways associated with pyroptosis and explore their relationship in pneumonia-induced sepsis. METHODS: First, significant signaling pathways related to pneumonia-induced sepsis were screened by bioinformatics analysis based on GSE48080. The peripheral blood samples from patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis and healthy subjects were collected. Pneumonia-induced sepsis rat models were also established. Then, inflammatory response, pyroptosis, and regulatory T cells (Tregs)/T-helper 17 (Th17), Th1/Th2, and M1/M2 cell ratios in pneumonia-induced sepsis were evaluated. RESULTS: IL-17 signaling pathway was significantly related to pneumonia-induced sepsis by bioinformatics analysis. Compared with healthy groups, the higher of Th17/Treg, Th1/Th2 and M1/M2 cell radios in the patients and sepsis rat model indicated that pneumonia-induced sepsis caused a severe inflammatory response. This result was confirmed by higher levels of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18) and an inflammation indicator (LDH), as well as pyroptosis occurrence in sepsis. Additionally, the up-regulation of key molecules (HMGB1, RAGE, IL-17A, TRAF6 and NK-\u03baB) in the IL-17 signaling pathway suggested the IL-17 pathway was activated. Moreover, the release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and the levels of the molecules (NLRP3, NLRC4, Cleaved caspase-1, and Cleaved GSDMD) associated with caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis were up-regulated in pneumonia-induced sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: As NK-\u03baB activation can promote the development of caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis, these findings suggested that the activation of the IL-17 signaling pathway could promote pyroptosis in pneumonia-induced sepsis.",

        "title": "Depression in young people.",
        "abstract": "Depression rates in young people have risen sharply in the past decade, especially in females, which is of concern because adolescence is a period of rapid social, emotional, and cognitive development and key life transitions. Adverse outcomes associated with depression in young people include depression recurrence; the onset of other psychiatric disorders; and wider, protracted impairments in interpersonal, social, educational, and occupational functioning. Thus, prevention and early intervention for depression in young people are priorities. Preventive and early intervention strategies typically target predisposing factors, antecedents, and symptoms of depression. Young people who have a family history of depression, exposure to social stressors (eg, bullying, discordant relationships, or stressful life events), and belong to certain subgroups (eg, having a chronic physical health problem or being a sexual minority) are at especially high risk of depression. Clinical antecedents include depressive symptoms, anxiety, and irritability. Evidence favours indicated prevention and targeted prevention to universal prevention. Emerging school-based and community-based social interventions show some promise. Depression is highly heterogeneous; therefore, a stepwise treatment approach is recommended, starting with brief psychosocial interventions, then a specific psychological therapy, and then an antidepressant medication.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The involvement of B-cells in multiple sclerosis has only recently emerged. Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the B-cell antigen CD20 with enhanced B-cell targeting. AREAS COVERED: This evaluation is of the identical ULTIMATE (UbLiTuximab In Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Effects) I and II trials comparing ublituximab (TG-1101) and teriflunomide in relapsing multiple sclerosis. The primary efficacy end point was the annualized relapse rate and was lower in the ublituximab than the teriflunomide group. EXPERT OPINION: The continuation rates to oral teriflunomide in ULTIMATE were higher than in other trials, possibly because of the supervised double-dummy protocol used with intravenous ublituximab. This may have contributed to the higher efficacy with teriflunomide in this trial than previously reported. Nevertheless, ublituximab was more effective than teriflunomide at reducing the annualized relapse rates and MRI endpoints, but not for no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the ULTIMATE trials did show that ublituximab was superior to teriflunomide in NEDA. Long-term studies of the adverse effects of ublituximab are required. Despite the positive results from ULTIMATE for ublituximab, it is still under the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and conclusions should await their findings.",

        "abstract": "Immunotherapies demand for predictive biomarkers to avoid unnecessary adverse effects and costs. Analytic morphomics is the technique to use body composition measures as imaging biomarkers for underlying pathophysiology to predict prognosis or outcome to therapy.\u00a0We investigated different body composition measures to predict response to immunotherapy. This IRB approved retrospective analysis encompassed 147 patients with ipilimumab therapy. Degree of macroangiopathy was quantified with the newly defined total plaque index (TPI), i.e. the body height corrected sum of the soft and hard plaque volume of the infrarenal aorta on portalvenous CT scans. Furthermore, mean psoas density (MPD), different adipose tissue parameters as well as degree of cerebral microangiopathy were extracted from the imaging data. Subsequent multivariate Cox regression analysis encompassed TPI, MPD, serum LDH, S100B, age, gender, number of immunotherapy cycles as well as extent of distant metastases. TPI and MPD correlated positively with PFS in multivariate analysis (p\u2009=\u20090.03 and p\u2009=\u20090.001, respectively). Furthermore, single visceral organ and/or soft tissue involvement significantly decreased progression risk (p\u2009=\u20090.01), whereas increased S100B level showed a trend towards PFS shortening (p\u2009=\u20090.05). In conclusion, degree of macroangiopathy and sarcopenia were independent predictors for outcome to immunotherapy and of equivalent significance compared to other clinical biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "Infants with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) continue to have significantly worse outcomes compared with older children with B-ALL, and those with relapsed or refractory (R/R) infant ALL have especially dismal outcomes with conventional treatment. CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in the treatment of R/R childhood B-ALL, although the majority of reports have been in noninfant patients. Barriers to the successful implementation of CAR T-cell therapy in infant B-ALL include challenges related to apheresis, product manufacturing, and disease-specific considerations such as lineage switch. We describe our experience using 2 experimental CD19 CAR T-cell products, SCRI-CAR19 or SCRI-CAR19x22, for 19 patients with R/R infant B-ALL enrolled in 3 clinical trials. CAR T-cell products were successfully manufactured in 18 of 19 (94.7%) patients, with a median age of 22.5\u00a0months at enrollment (range, 14.5-40.1). Of 17 (94.1%) treated patients, 16 achieved a complete remission without detectable minimal residual disease. The 1-year leukemia-free survival was 75%, and 1-year overall survival was 76.5%, with a median follow-up time of 35.8\u00a0months (range, 1.7-83.6).

        "abstract": "The effect of cytokines on non-traditional immunological targets under conditions of chronic inflammation is an ongoing subject of study. Fatigue is a symptom often associated with autoimmune diseases. Chronic inflammatory response and activated cell-mediated immunity are associated with cardiovascular myopathies which can be driven by muscle weakness and fatigue. Thus, we hypothesize that immune dysfunction-driven changes in myocyte mitochondria may play a critical role in fatigue-related pathogenesis. We show that persistent low-level expression of IFN-\u03b3 in designated IFN-\u03b3 AU-Rich Element deletion mice (ARE mice) under androgen exposure resulted in mitochondrial and metabolic deficiencies in myocytes from male or castrated ARE mice. Most notably, echocardiography unveiled that low ejection fraction in the left ventricle post-stress correlated with mitochondrial deficiencies, explaining how heart function decreases under stress. We report that inefficiencies and structural changes in mitochondria, with changes to expression of mitochondrial genes, are linked to male-biased fatigue and acute cardiomyopathy under stress. Our work highlights how male androgen hormone backgrounds and active autoimmunity reduce mitochondrial function and the ability to cope with stress and how pharmacological blockade of stress signal protects heart function. These studies provide new insight into the diverse actions of IFN-\u03b3 in fatigue, energy metabolism, and autoimmunity. \u00a9 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

        "abstract": "Discoidin Domain Receptor (DDR)-1 is activated by collagen. Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is FDA-approved for leukemia and potently inhibits DDR-1. Individuals diagnosed with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) treated with nilotinib (versus placebo) for 12\u00a0months showed reduction of amyloid plaque and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid, and attenuation of hippocampal volume loss. However, the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we explored unbiased next generation whole genome miRNA sequencing from AD patients CSF and miRNAs were matched with their corresponding mRNAs using gene ontology. Changes in CSF miRNAs were confirmed via measurement of CSF DDR1 activity and plasma levels of AD biomarkers. Approximately 1050 miRNAs are detected in the CSF but only 17 miRNAs are specifically altered between baseline and 12-month treatment with nilotinib versus placebo. Treatment with nilotinib significantly reduces collagen and DDR1 gene expression (upregulated in AD brain), in association with inhibition of CSF DDR1. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins and chemokines are reduced along with caspase-3 gene expression. Specific genes that indicate vascular fibrosis, e.g., collagen, Transforming Growth Factors (TGFs) and Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteases (TIMPs) are altered by DDR1 inhibition with nilotinib. Specific changes in vesicular transport, including the neurotransmitters dopamine and acetylcholine, and autophagy genes, including ATGs, indicate facilitation of autophagic flux and cellular trafficking. Inhibition of DDR1 with nilotinib may be a safe and effective adjunct treatment strategy involving an oral drug that enters the CNS and adequately engages its target. DDR1 inhibition with nilotinib exhibits multi-modal effects not only on amyloid and tau clearance but also on anti-inflammatory markers that may reduce cerebrovascular fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide expression profiles have been previously employed as clinical research diagnostic tools for newborn sepsis. We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has dramatically altered the landscape of treatment options available to children and adults with ALL. With complete remission induction rates exceeding 70% in most trials and FDA approval of one CD19 CAR T-cell construct in ALL, CAR T-cell therapy has become a mainstay in the ALL treatment algorithm for those with relapsed/refractory disease. Despite the high remission induction rate, with growing experience using CAR T-cell therapy in ALL, a host of barriers to maintaining long-term durable remissions have been identified. Specifically, relapse after, resistance to, or loss of long-term CAR T-cell persistence may all hinder CAR T-cell efficacy. In this review, we provide an overview of the current limitations which inform the design of the next generation of CAR T-cells and discuss advances in CAR T-cell engineering aimed to improve upon outcomes with CAR T-cell-based therapy in ALL.",

        "title": "Adaptation and Validation of a Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score and Evaluation of the Sepsis-3 Definitions in Critically Ill Children.",
        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) uses the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to grade organ dysfunction in adult patients with suspected infection. However, the SOFA score is not adjusted for age and therefore not suitable for children. OBJECTIVES: To adapt and validate a pediatric version of the SOFA score (pSOFA) in critically ill children and to evaluate the Sepsis-3 definitions in patients with confirmed or suspected infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective observational cohort study included all critically ill children 21 years or younger admitted to a 20-bed, multidisciplinary, tertiary pediatric intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and August 1, 2016. Data on these children were obtained from an electronic health record database. The pSOFA score was developed by adapting the original SOFA score with age-adjusted cutoffs for the cardiovascular and renal systems and by expanding the respiratory criteria to include noninvasive surrogates of lung injury. Daily pSOFA scores were calculated from admission until day 28 of hospitalization, discharge, or death (whichever came first). Three additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were calculated for comparison. EXPOSURES: Organ dysfunction measured by the pSOFA score, and sepsis and septic shock according to the Sepsis-3 definitions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The daily pSOFA scores and additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were compared. Performance was evaluated using the area under the curve. The pSOFA score was then used to assess the Sepsis-3 definitions in the subgroup of children with confirmed or suspected infection. RESULTS: In all, 6303 patients with 8711 encounters met inclusion criteria. Each encounter was treated independently. Of the 8482 survivors of hospital encounters, 4644 (54.7%) were male and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 69 (17-156) months. Among the 229 nonsurvivors, 127 (55.4%) were male with a median (IQR) age of 43 (8-144) months. In-hospital mortality was 2.6%. The maximum pSOFA score had excellent discrimination for in-hospital mortality, with an area under the curve of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92-0.95). The pSOFA score had a similar or better performance than other pediatric organ dysfunction scores. According to the Sepsis-3 definitions, 1231 patients (14.1%) were classified as having sepsis and had a mortality rate of 12.1%, and 347 (4.0%) had septic shock and a mortality rate of 32.3%. Patients with sepsis were more likely to die than patients with confirmed or suspected infection but no sepsis (odds ratio, 18; 95% CI, 11-28). Of the 229 patients who died during their hospitalization, 149 (65.0%) had sepsis or septic shock during their course. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The pSOFA score was adapted and validated with age-adjusted variables in critically ill children. Using the pSOFA score, the Sepsis-3 definitions were assessed in children with confirmed or suspected infection. This study is the first assessment, to date, of the Sepsis-3 definitions in critically ill children. Use of these definitions in children is feasible and shows promising results.",

        "title": "Epidemiology of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis in children in Switzerland: a population-based cohort study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. We assessed population-based incidence and outcomes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis in children in Switzerland. METHODS: We did a multicentre, prospective, cohort study at ten paediatric hospitals in Switzerland. We included neonates and children younger than 17 years with blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis. Children were eligible if they met criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome-according to 2005 paediatric consensus definition- at the time of blood culture sampling. Incidence was calculated by dividing the number of annual sepsis episodes in the study for the years 2012-15 by the end-of-year resident paediatric population in Switzerland. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in the first 30 days after sepsis onset. FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2011, and Dec 31, 2015, we enrolled 1096 children to our study. Of 1181 episodes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis, 382 (32%) occurred in 379 previously healthy children, 402 (34%) in 391 neonates, and 397 (34%) in 341 children with comorbidities. Incidence was 25\u00b71 cases per 100\u2008000 (95% CI 23\u00b78-26\u00b74) in children and 146\u00b70 cases per 100\u2008000 (133\u00b72-159\u00b76) in neonates. Central line-associated bloodstream infections and primary bloodstream infections accounted for 569 (48%) of 1181 episodes, and organ dysfunction was present in 455 (39%) of 1181 episodes. Escherichia coli (242 of 1181 [20%]), Staphylococcus aureus (177 of 1181 [15%]), coagulase-negative staphylococci (135 of 1181 [11%]), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (118 of 1181 [10%]) were the most prevalent pathogens in our study, accounting for 57% of episodes. The overall case-fatality ratio was 7% (82 of 1181 episodes; 95% CI 5\u00b76-8\u00b76), and it was higher in neonates (11%, 45 of 402 episodes; 8\u00b74-14\u00b78; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 4\u00b741, 95% CI 1\u00b775-11\u00b71) and children with comorbidities (7%, 27 of 397 episodes; 4\u00b76-9\u00b79; OR 4\u00b797, 1\u00b784-13\u00b74) compared with previously healthy children (3%, ten of 382 episodes; 1\u00b73-4\u00b79). The case-fatality ratio was 1% (five of 726 episodes [95% CI 0\u00b73-1\u00b77]) for children without organ dysfunction, which increased to 17% (77 of 455 episodes [13\u00b77-20\u00b78]) when organ dysfunction was present (adjusted OR 4\u00b784, 95% CI 1\u00b740-16\u00b77). INTERPRETATION: The burden of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis on child health remains considerable. We recorded key differences in predominant organisms, severity, and outcome between neonates, previously healthy children, and children with comorbidities. Although for most episodes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis, no organ dysfunction was seen, presence of organ dysfunction was strongly associated with mortality.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AIMS: The targeting of solid cancers with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells faces many technological hurdles, including selection of optimal target antigens. Promising pre-clinical and clinical data of CAR T-cell activity have emerged from targeting surface antigens such as GD2 and B7H3 in childhood cancer neuroblastoma. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is expressed in a majority of neuroblastomas at low antigen density but is largely absent from healthy tissues. METHODS: To explore an alternate target antigen for neuroblastoma CAR T-cell therapy, the authors generated and screened a single-chain variable fragment library targeting ALK extracellular domain to make a panel of new anti-ALK CAR T-cell constructs. RESULTS: A lead novel CAR T-cell construct was capable of specific cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma cells expressing low levels of ALK, but with only weak cytokine and proliferative T-cell responses. To explore strategies for amplifying ALK CAR T cells, the authors generated a co-CAR approach in which T cells received signal 1 from a first-generation ALK construct and signal 2 from anti-B7H3 or GD2 chimeric co-stimulatory receptors. The co-CAR approach successfully demonstrated the ability to avoid targeting single-antigen-positive targets as a strategy for mitigating on-target off-tumor toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further proof of concept for ALK as a neuroblastoma CAR T-cell target.",

Plasma lactate at 0 h and 6 h was significantly higher, and lactate clearance was significantly lower in non-survivors. The optimal cut-off of plasma lactate at 6h for identifying mortality was 2.5\u2009mmol/L (sensitivity 85% and specificity 74%). pSOFA score had the best predictive ability for mortality (AUC 0.89) followed by hs-CRP at 0 h (AUC 0.86), hs-CRP at 48 h (AUC 0.83), plasma lactate levels at 6 h (AUC 0.83), and plasma lactate at 0 h (AUC 0.67).

We aimed to evaluate the genetic profile of TLR pathway-related key genes; the myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MYD88), IL1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), the nuclear factor kappa-B1 (NFKB1), and interleukin 6 (IL6) in the blood of neonates with sepsis at the time of admission and post-treatment for the available paired-samples. This case-control study included 124 infants with sepsis admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and 17 controls. The relative gene expressions were quantified by TaqMan Real-Time qPCR and correlated to the clinic-laboratory data. MYD88, NFKB1, and IL6 relative expressions were significantly higher in sepsis cases than controls. Higher levels of MYD88 and IL6 were found in male neonates and contributed to the sex-based separation of the cases by the principal component analysis. ROC analysis revealed MYD88 and NFKB1 transcripts to be good biomarkers for sepsis. Furthermore, patients with high circulatory MYD88 levels were associated with poor survival, as revealed by Kaplan-Meier curves analysis. MYD88, NFKB1, and IL6 transcripts showed association with different poor-outcome manifestations. Clustering analysis split the patient cohort into three distinct groups according to their transcriptomic signature and CRP levels. In conclusion, the study TLR pathway-related transcripts have a gender-specific signature, diagnostic, and prognostic clinical utility in neonatal sepsis.",

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence, aetiology and outcomes of physician-diagnosed sepsis in hospitalised neonates who had previously been discharged home after delivery in Soweto, South Africa. METHODS: A retrospective review using data abstracted from clinical and laboratory databases identified physician-diagnosed sepsis cases in neonates admitted to the general paediatric wards at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital from January 2015 to September 2016. Neonates with physician-diagnosed sepsis were categorised into two groups based on putative pathogens recovered from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid specimens: (i) culture-confirmed sepsis; and (ii) culture-negative sepsis. RESULTS: Of 1\u00a0826 neonatal admissions, 1\u00a0025 (56.2%) had physician-diagnosed sepsis: 166 (16.2%) with culture-confirmed sepsis and 859 (83.8%) with culture-negative neonatal sepsis. The commonest pathogens causing culture-confirmed neonatal sepsis were Streptococcus viridans (n=53; 26.5%), S. agalactiae (n=38; 19.0%), and Staphylococcus aureus (n=25; 12.5%). The case fatality rates for culture-confirmed sepsis and culture-negative sepsis were 10.8% (18/166) and 2.6% (22/859), respectively. The odds of death occurring during hospitalisation was 10-fold (95% confidence interval 3.7 - 26.9) higher in neonates with culture-confirmed sepsis compared with culture-negative sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, physician-diagnosed sepsis represents a huge disease burden in previously healthy neonates hospitalised from home. Most sepsis cases were attributed to S. viridans, S. agalactiae and S. aureus.",

        "abstract": "Almost 50% of the infertility cases are due to male factors. Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) allow to overcome the incapacity of these patients' spermatozoa to fertilize the oocyte and produce a viable and healthy offspring, but the efficiency of the different techniques has still the potential to improve. According to the latest reports of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC), the percentages of deliveries per ART cycle in 2014 and 2016 were 21 and 22%, respectively. Among the reasons for this relatively low efficiency, the quality of the spermatozoa has been pointed out as critical, and the presence of high percentages of DNA-damaged spermatozoa in patients' ejaculates is possibly one of the main factors reducing the ARTs outcomes. Thus, one of the main challenges in reproductive medicine is to ensure the highest quality of the spermatozoa used in ARTs, and specifically, in terms of genetic integrity. The latest techniques for the preparation and selection of human spermatozoa are herein discussed focusing on those proven to improve one or several of the following parameters: sperm genetic integrity, fertilization capacity, embryo production, and ",

        "abstract": "An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7th Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD \u00b1 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged .16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged .15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called 'invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised riskbehaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the \"invisible\" risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adolescence is crucial period for laying the foundations for healthy development and mental well-being. The increasing prevalence of mental disorders amongst adolescents makes promotion of mental well-being and prevention interventions at schools important. UPRIGHT (Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally implemented in schools to improve and promote mental Health for Teenagers) is designed as a whole school approach (school community, students and families) to promote a culture of mental well-being and prevent mental disorders by enhancing resilience capacities. The present article aims at describing the rationale, conceptual framework, as well as methodology of implementation and evaluation of the UPRIGHT intervention. METHODS: UPRIGHT project is a research and innovation project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement No. 754919 (Duration: 48\u2009months). The theoretical framework has been developed by an innovative and multidisciplinary approach using a co-creation process inside the UPRIGHT Consortium (involving seven institutions from Spain, Italy, Poland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland). Resulted is the UPRIGHT programme with 18 skills related to 4 components: Mindfulness, Coping, Efficacy and Social and Emotional Learning. Among the five Pan-European regions, 34 schools have been currently involved (17 control; 17 intervention) and around 6000 adolescents and their families are foreseen to participate along a 3-year period of evaluation. Effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated as a randomized controlled trial including quantitative and qualitative analysis in the five Pan-European regions representative of the cultural and socioeconomic diversity. The cost-effectiveness assessment will be performed by simulation modelling methods. DISCUSSION: We expect a short- to medium-term improvement of mental well-being in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities. The study may provide robust evidence on intrapersonal, familiar and social environmental resilience factors promoting positive mental well-being.

        "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neuromuscular disease due to injury in the infant's brain. The CP disorder causes many neurologic dysfunctions in the patient. Various treatment methods have been used for the management of CP disorder. However, there has been no absolute cure for this condition. Furthermore, some of the procedures which are currently used for relief of symptoms in CP cause discomfort or side effects in the patient. Recently, stem cell therapy has attracted a huge interest as a new therapeutic method for treatment of CP. Several investigations in animal and human with CP have demonstrated positive potential of stem cell transplantation for the treatment of CP disorder. The ultimate goal of this therapeutic method is to harness the regenerative capacity of the stem cells causing a formation of new tissues to replace the damaged tissue. During the recent years, there have been many investigations on stem cell therapy. However, there are still many unclear issues regarding this method and high effort is needed to create a technology as a perfect treatment. This review will discuss the scientific background of stem cell therapy for cerebral palsy including evidences from current clinical trials.",

The varying microbiological pattern of sepsis warrants the need for researches on the causative organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. The epidemiology of neonatal and pediatric sepsis in Ethiopia is under-research. The objective of this study was to evaluate the burden of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among children suspected of sepsis. METHODS: An institutional-based prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 370 pediatric(age birth-15 years) patients suspected of sepsis at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized hospital from December 2020 to November 2021. Blood samples were collected aseptically and inoculated into Tryptone Soya Broth for culture. The organisms grown were identified by standard microbiological methods and subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing by modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method recommended by Clinical laboratory and standard institute. Methicillin resistance was confirmed using Cefoxitin disk diffusion method. Data entry and analysis were done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 software. A p-value less than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval was considered statically significant. RESULTS: Out of the total 370 study subjects, 21.6% (80/370) of them were culture positive. Of these, 43 (53.8%) and 37 (46.3%) were Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, respectively. The most prevalent Gram-positive bacterial isolate was Staphylococcus aureus (n\u2009=\u200924; 30%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (n\u2009=\u20097; 8.8%). Among the Gram-negative bacterial isolates, the leading bacteria was Klebsiella pneumoniae (n\u2009=\u200920; 25%) followed by Escherichia coli (n\u2009=\u20097; 8.8%). Clindamycin, Chloramphenicol, Gentamicin and Ciprofloxacin were the most effective antibiotics against Gram-positive bacterial isolates while Amikacin, Meropenem and Chloramphenicol were effective against Gram-negative pathogens. Methicillin resistance was detected in 45.8% of Staphylococcus aureus. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was observed in 76% of the bacterial isolates. CONCLUSION: Gram positive bacteria were the predominant isolates among pediatric sepsis cases and most of the bacterial isolates showed MDR. Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were frequently isolated bacteria. The high prevalence of drug resistance warrants rational use of antibiotics and the need for regular antibiotic susceptibility surveillance studies.",

Overexpression or activation of DDR1 in various pathological scenarios makes it a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer, fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and neuropsychiatric, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we summarize current therapeutic approaches targeting DDR1 from a medicinal chemistry perspective. Furthermore, we analyze factors other than issues of low selectivity and risk of resistance, contributing to the infrequent success of DDR1 inhibitors. The complex interplay between DDR1 and the extracellular matrix (ECM) necessitates additional validation, given that DDR1 might exhibit complex and synergistic interactions with other signaling molecules during ECM regulation. The mechanisms involved in DDR1 regulation in cancer and inflammation-related diseases also remain unknown.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis remains one of the leading causes of mortality in newborns. Several brainstem-regulated physiological processes undergo disruption during neonatal sepsis. Mechanistic knowledge gaps exist at the interplay between metabolism and immune activation to brainstem neural circuits and pertinent physiological functions in neonates. To delineate this association, we induced systemic inflammation either by TLR4 (LPS) or TLR1/2 (PAM3CSK4) ligand administration in postnatal day 5 mice (PD5). Our findings show that LPS and PAM3CSK4 evoke substantial changes in respiration and metabolism. Physiological trade-offs led to hypometabolic-hypothermic responses due to LPS, but not PAM3CSK4, whereas to both TLR ligands blunted respiratory chemoreflexes. Neuroinflammatory pathways modulation in brainstem showed more robust effects in LPS than PAM3CSK4. Brainstem neurons, microglia, and astrocyte gene expression analyses showed unique responses to TLR ligands. PAM3CSK4 did not significantly modulate gene expression changes in GLAST-1 positive brainstem astrocytes. PD5 pups receiving PAM3CSK4 failed to maintain a prolonged metabolic state repression, which correlated to enhanced gasping latency and impaired autoresuscitation during anoxic chemoreflex challenges. In contrast, LPS administered pups showed no significant changes in anoxic chemoreflex. Electrophysiological studies from brainstem slices prepared from pups exposed to either TLR4 or PAM3CSK4 showed compromised transmission between preB\u00f6tzinger complex and Hypoglossal as an exclusive response to the TLR1/2 ligand. Spatial gene expression analysis demonstrated a region-specific modulation of PAM3CSK4 within the raphe nucleus relative to other anatomical sites evaluated. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes due to inflammation might be a crucial tolerance mechanism for neonatal sepsis preserving neural control of breathing.",

        "abstract": "The present study examined genetic, prenatal, and postnatal environmental pathways in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and depressive symptoms from parents to early adolescents (when these symptoms start to increase), while considering timing effects of exposure to parent anxiety and depressive symptoms postnatally. The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

CAR is manufactured to express T cells through various ways such as using retroviruses, transposons and transposase, electroporation, and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Together, it provides flexibility since it recognizes proteins without the need of antigen processing and presentation, can recognize carbohydrates and lipids, and it has been proven to be cost-effective. Despite these benefits however, problems faced by this therapy include unrecognized tumor proteins possibly escaping the system, CAR T cell expression being transient, and the therapy being one of the most expensive cancer drug ever approved. As a result, recent progress has been ongoing where researchers have combined CAR-T cells with natural killer (NK) cells and different cytokines to maximize its efficacy and potency while limiting potential risks such as cytokine release syndrome. Consequently, these cells gained the ability to be universal-being able to be used to treat multiple patients, maintain viability for a longer period, and prevent relapse.",

        "abstract": "Despite extensive research, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a progressive and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease. Limited knowledge of the underlying causes of ALS has made it difficult to target upstream biological mechanisms of disease, and therapeutic interventions are usually administered relatively late in the course of disease. Genetic forms of ALS offer a unique opportunity for therapeutic development, as genetic associations may reveal potential insights into disease etiology. Genetic ALS may also be amenable to investigating earlier intervention given the possibility of identifying clinically presymptomatic, at-risk individuals with causative genetic variants. There is increasing evidence for a presymptomatic phase of ALS, with biomarker data from the Pre-Symptomatic Familial ALS (Pre-fALS) study showing that an elevation in blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) precedes phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease. Tofersen is an investigational antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce synthesis of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein through degradation of SOD1 mRNA. Informed by Pre-fALS and the tofersen clinical development program, the ATLAS study (NCT04856982) is designed to evaluate the impact of initiating tofersen in presymptomatic carriers of SOD1 variants associated with high or complete penetrance and rapid disease progression who also have biomarker evidence of disease activity (elevated plasma NfL). The ATLAS study will investigate whether tofersen can delay the emergence of clinically manifest ALS. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first interventional trial in presymptomatic ALS and has the potential to yield important insights into the design and conduct of presymptomatic trials, identification, and monitoring of at-risk individuals, and future treatment paradigms in ALS.",

This process often involves the application of social paradigms - however, these often only include momentary affective depictions rather than unfolding interactions. This constitutes a limitation in our capacity to probe core symptoms, and leaves potential findings uncovered which could help those who are in close relationships with affected individuals. Here, we deployed a novel task in which subjects interact with four unknown virtual partners in a turn-taking paradigm akin to a dance, and report on their experience with each. The virtual partners embody four combinations of low/high expressivity of positive/negative mood. Higher scores on our symptomatic measures of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were all linked to a general negative appraisal of all the interpersonal experiences. Moreover, the negative appraisal of the partner who displayed a high negative/low positive mood was tied with attachment anxiety and BPD symptoms. The extent to which subjects felt responsible for causing partners' distress was most strongly linked to attachment anxiety. Finally, we provide a fully-fledged exploration of move-by-move action latencies and click distances from partners. This analysis underscored slower movement initiation from anxiously attached individuals throughout all virtual interactions. In summary, we describe a novel paradigm for second-person neuroscience, which allowed both the replication of established results and the capture of new behavioural signatures associated with attachment anxiety, and discuss its limitations.",

This has led to the emergence of  OBJECTIVE: This paper analyzes the role and functions of a neuropsychologist in primary schools and the possibilities of his/her collaboration with other specialists in diagnosing children's problems and organizing remediation for problematic kids. DESIGN: We established four steps for launching neuropsychological work at primary schools: 1) setting up a screening group for neuropsychological assessment of all children entering the first year of school; 2) a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of the children who showed poor results in the first step of the study; 3)ateam remediation program; and 4) evaluation of the remediation results by a new neuropsychological assessment at the end of the remediation program. RESULTS: The results of the first step of our study showed a very high percentage of children with cognitive problems- 37% of 202 6-8 year-old schoolchildren entering the first year of school. They formed a group at risk for future learning disabilities and maladjustment at school. Age and gender differences, and the structure of cognitive underdevelopment, were discussed in the second step of our study. In the third step, a team of school specialists, including a neuropsychologist, a teacher, a school psychologist, and a school social worker, implemented a remediation program which was created and supervised by a neuropsychologist. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of the pupils revealed a complex structure of cognitive disturbances which interfere with pupils' learning abilities in primary school. The team approach can efficiently prevent learning disabilities and help children with cognitive underdevelopment and risks of future unsuccess at school, when this collaboration of school specialists has a common theoretical approach and is based upon comprehensive neuropsychological assessment.",

        "title": "The Extracellular Matrix Receptor Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 Regulates Collagen Transcription by Translocating to the Nucleus.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is activated by collagens, upregulated in injured and fibrotic kidneys, and contributes to fibrosis by regulating extracellular matrix production, but how DDR1 controls fibrosis is poorly understood. DDR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). RTKs can translocate to the nucleus  METHODS: To determine whether DDR1 translocates to the nucleus and whether this event is mediated by collagen-induced DDR1 activation, we generated renal cells expressing wild-type or mutant forms of DDR1 no longer able to bind collagen. Then, we determined the location of the DDR1 upon collagen stimulation. Using both biochemical assays and immunofluorescence, we analyzed the steps involved in DDR1 nuclear translocation. RESULTS: We show that although DDR1 and its natural ligand, collagen, lack an NLS, DDR1 is present in the nucleus of injured human and mouse kidney proximal tubules. We show that DDR1 nuclear translocation requires collagen-mediated receptor activation and interaction of DDR1 with SEC61B, a component of the Sec61 translocon, and nonmuscle myosin IIA and  CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a novel mechanism whereby activated DDR1 translates to the nucleus to regulate synthesis of profibrotic molecules.",

        "title": "Cutaneous deliberate self-harm in Polish school teenagers - an inter-disciplinary challenge.",
        "abstract": "Self-harm of the skin is a complex problem encountered mainly in adolescents and young adults. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of deliberate cutaneous self-harm without suicidal intent among secondary school teenagers of the Lodz region. A self-administered specially designed anonymous questionnaire was delivered to 1,448 secondary school teenagers, aged 12-19 years. The lifetime prevalence of self-reported deliberate self-harm was 19.5%, out of which 14.4% confirmed isolated cutaneous self-injury (self-cutting in the vast majority of cases), 1.7% ingested a substance or drug in excessive amounts and 3.5% declared both behaviours. Our results indicate that skin is the organ most commonly involved in deliberate self-harm. Dermatologists, especially those focussed on dermatosurgery and aesthetic dermatology, should understand the special issues relating to such patients before taking decisions concerning performing any procedures on these individuals, since deliberate self-harm has been recognised as one of the main risk factors of suicide.",

        "title": "CAR T Cell Therapy of Non-hematopoietic Malignancies: Detours on the Road to Clinical Success.",
        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells represent a breakthrough in personalized medicine. In this strategy, a patient's own T lymphocytes are genetically reprogrammed to encode a synthetic receptor that binds a tumor antigen, allowing T cells to recognize and kill antigen-expressing cancer cells. As a result of complete and durable responses in individuals who are refractory to standard of care therapy, CAR T cells directed against the CD19 protein have been granted United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as a therapy for treatment of pediatric and young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Human trials of CAR T cells targeting CD19 or B cell maturation antigen in multiple myeloma have also reported early successes. However, a clear and consistently reproducible demonstration of the clinical efficacy of CAR T cells in the setting of solid tumors has not been reported to date. Here, we review the history and status of CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors, potential T cell-intrinsic determinants of response and resistance as well as extrinsic obstacles to the success of this approach for much more prevalent non-hematopoietic malignancies. In addition, we summarize recent strategies and innovations that aim to augment the potency of CAR T cells in the face of multiple immunosuppressive barriers operative within the solid tumor microenvironment. Advances in the field of CAR T cell biology over the coming years in the areas of safety, reliability and efficacy against non-hematopoietic cancers will ultimately determine how transformative adoptive T cell therapy will be in the broader battle against cancer.",
