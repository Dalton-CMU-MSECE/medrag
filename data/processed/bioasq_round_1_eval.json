Key mechanisms include alterations in gut-brain axis activity, gut dysbiosis, and increased gut permeability, as seen in conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome. In fibromyalgia, metabolic disruptions such as tyrosine, purine, and pyrimidine pathway changes, as well as glutaminergic neurotransmission abnormalities, play a role. Cancer-related fatigue involves phospholipid metabolism disturbances, endocannabinoid system changes, and glycerophospholipid imbalances. Post-COVID-19 fatigue is linked to dysautonomia, micro-clotting, impaired oxygen delivery, and disruptions in cellular energy metabolism.

It also implicates hypofunction of the glutamatergic system due to decreased acetyl-carnitine uptake in specific brain regions. Additionally, metabolic changes, particularly in response to stress, play a role. Abnormalities in neuromuscular junctions and myotendinous junctions contribute to fatigue symptoms, especially in conditions like major depressive disorder. The involvement of inflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and the autonomic nervous system is suggested, though further research is needed.

The prevalence of specific pathogens may vary by region and by specific patient populations such as neonates in intensive care units, where CONS (coagulase-negative staphylococci) has emerged as a common pathogen.
