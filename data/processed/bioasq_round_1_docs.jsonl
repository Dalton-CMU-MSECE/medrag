BACKGROUND: Being the most common cause of children's death, sepsis is a challenge for most physicians. In order to improve the outcomes, it is important to know the aetiology and peculiarities of sepsis in a particular region and hospital. The aim of this study was to analyse the outcomes of sepsis in a paediatric intensive care unit and their relation with patients' characteristics and causative microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Sepsis Registration System in Vilnius University Children's hospital was started in 2012. From 2012 to 2015, we found 529 sepsis cases in our hospital, 203 of which were found to be fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria (patient's age >28 days on admission, taken blood culture/positive PCR test, need for paediatric ICU hospitalization) and were included in the final analysis. Abbreviations: ICD - international disease classification PCR - polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Sepsis made 4% of all patients of the paediatric ICU in the period from 2012 to 2015 and caused 32% of deaths in the unit. Paediatric mortality reached 14% of all sepsis cases in our analysis, the majority of them due to hospital-acquired sepsis that occurred in patients suffering from oncologic or hematologic diseases. Another significant part of the patients that did not survive were previously healthy with no co-morbidities. The most common microorganism in lethal community-acquired cases was  CONCLUSIONS: A large percentage of lethal outcomes that occur in the paediatric ICU are due to sepsis. The majority of lethal cases of sepsis occur in patients suffering from chronic co-morbidities, such as oncologic, hematologic, neurologic, and others.

Literature has found reciprocal relations between parental depression and child psychopathology and effects of parental depression on children's cognition. The present study is the first to examine reciprocity among parental depression and child cognition, and pathways to child psychopathology. Structural equation models were conducted using data from the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project, a nationally representative sample of 3,001 economically marginalized families. Measures were collected in four waves from 14 months to 10-11 years. Reciprocal associations emerged between maternal and paternal depression at from 14 months to 5 years. Reciprocal parental depression was associated with greater psychopathology at age 10-11. Maternal depression predicted poorer child cognition, which indirectly predicted increased depression in mothers of children aged 3-5 through paternal depression, and in fathers at age 3, through earlier paternal depression. This study was unable to parse within- and between-person effects. Additionally, data for paternal depression was limited to ages 2 and 3.

Primary outcome was resolution of diarrhea at 3 months post-transplantation. A secondary analysis compared charge data associated with FMT by intragastric delivery vs administration by colonoscopy or nasoduodenal tube. RESULTS: A total of 47 intragastric FMT procedures were performed in 42 children (median age 9 years) with recurrent CDI. Response to treatment varied by disease status, with 94% success in previously healthy children, 75% in medically complex children, and 54% in children with inflammatory bowel disease (P = .04). FMT via intragastric delivery showed lower facility and professional charges by 85% and 78% compared with delivery via colonoscopy and radiology-placed nasoduodenal tube, respectively. The use of stool derived from a donor stool bank decreased charges by 49% compared with charges associated with the use of a donor who was a relative.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate diagnostic biomarkers and immune cell infiltration in pediatric sepsis. METHODS: Three datasets (GSE13904, GSE26378, and GSE26440) were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. After identifying overlapping genes in differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and modular sepsis genes selected via a weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) in the GSE26378 dataset, pivotal genes were further identified by using LASSO regression and random forest analysis to construct a diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to validate the efficacy of the diagnostic model for pediatric sepsis. Furthermore, we used qRT-PCR to detect the expression levels of pivotal genes and validate the diagnostic model's ability to diagnose pediatric sepsis in 65 actual clinical samples. RESULTS: Among 294 overlapping genes of DEGs and modular sepsis genes, five pivotal genes (STOM, MS4A4A, CD177, MMP8, and MCEMP1) were screened to construct a diagnostic model of pediatric sepsis. The expression of the five pivotal genes was higher in the sepsis group than in the normal group. The diagnostic model showed good diagnostic ability with AUCs of 1, 0.986, and 0.968. More importantly, the diagnostic model showed good diagnostic ability with AUCs of 0.937 in the 65 clinical samples and showed better efficacy compared to conventional inflammatory indicators such as procalcitonin (PCT), white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and neutrophil percentage (NEU%).

Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a debilitating disorder of unknown aetiology, characterised by severe disabling fatigue in the absence of alternative diagnosis. Historically, there has been a tendency to draw psychological explanations for the origin of fatigue; however, this model is at odds with findings that fatigue and accompanying symptoms may be explained by central and peripheral pathophysiological mechanisms, including effects of the immune, oxidative, mitochondrial, and neuronal pathways. For example, patient descriptions of their fatigue regularly cite difficulty in maintaining muscle activity due to perceived lack of energy. This narrative review examined the literature for evidence of biochemical dysfunction in CFS/ME at the skeletal muscle level. Methods. Literature was examined following searches of PUB MED, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, using key words such as CFS/ME, immune, autoimmune, mitochondria, muscle, and acidosis. Results. Studies show evidence for skeletal muscle biochemical abnormality in CFS/ME patients, particularly in relation to bioenergetic dysfunction. Discussion. Bioenergetic muscle dysfunction is evident in CFS/ME, with a tendency towards an overutilisation of the lactate dehydrogenase pathway following low-level exercise, in addition to slowed acid clearance after exercise.

Laparoscopy is invasive and often causes a delay in diagnosis and treatment, especially in symptomatic teenagers and young women. Moreover, the visual inspection of the pelvis has major limitations, particularly for the diagnosis of retroperitoneal lesions. It is therefore not surprising that considerable efforts are being made to improve imaging techniques and to evaluate the diagnostic value of potential molecular markers of disease. RECENT FINDINGS: High-resolution transvaginal ultrasonography and, in selected cases, magnetic resonance imaging improve the diagnosis of retroperitoneal pelvic endometriosis as well as the identification of lesions that involve pelvic organs. A variety of serum and endometrial markers are being evaluated for their diagnostic potential, particularly in endometriosis associated infertility. The first gene profiling studies are showing positive results and proteomic technology is being applied to identify novel diagnostic protein expression patterns. SUMMARY: Current imaging techniques, such as transvaginal ultrasonography, are useful to screen the pelvis for the presence of retroperitoneal endometriosis but fail to diagnose peritoneal lesions, small ovarian endometriomas and adhesions. Postgenomic technologies and identification of novel serum and endometrial markers are likely to revolutionize future diagnosis of endometriosis.", "pub_date": "2003-12-01", "authors": ["Ivo Brosens", "Patrick Puttemans", "Rudi Campo", "Stephan Gordts", "Jan Brosens"], "journal": "Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology", "doi": "10.1097/00001703-200312000-00011", "source": "pubmed"}

This review has dealt with two rather uncommon disorders, namely mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome which are indolent malignant lymphomas, occurring primarily in the fifth decade, and affecting males most frequently. Historically, mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome have been described for a relatively short time. As witnessed by Table 2, little was known concerning these disorders, other than clinical and pathologic features, until the application of immunologic, cell biologic, and cytogenetic technology which burgeoned a multitude of questions. The discovery of TCGF has allowed for both continuous growth of normal and neoplastic T cells and for the clonal expansion of some malignant clones. The establishment of these continuous cultures allowed for: (1) investigation of the mechanism of TCGF production and stimulation of T-cell growth, and (2) identification of HTLV, a retrovirus found in cell cultures from two patients with CTCL, and subsequently from patients with Japanese adult T-cell lymphoma. In addition, the HTLV has been related to a more virulent form of T-cell malignancy. The exact etiologic role of this virus in the CTCL is presently the subject of intense investigation. Through the use of immunologic methods the malignant cell of CTCL has been pheno-typically and functionally characterized as a \"helper/inducer\" subtype (E rosette+, anti-T-cell antisera+, T11+, T1+, T3+, 3A1-, T6-, T8-) and usually Ia-, HLADR-. Clinical manifestations of the phenotype may be clinically apparent in the serologic abnormalities present in these disorders. Utilizing these methods to investigate these disorders may provide a key to the understanding of T-cell function and cellular immunity much as myeloma provided a model for the understanding of B cells and immunity. Clinically and pathologically, these disorders behave as malignant indolent lymphomas with spread from localized cutaneous lesions to extracutaneous involvement of the blood, lymph nodes, and viscera culminating in the death of the patient from either organ dysfunction or infectious complications. At autopsy, this extracutaneous involvement is more pronounced than what was expected ante-mortem. Application of prospective staging techniques employing such special procedures as E-rosette cytology, cytogenetics, and electron microscopy in addition to usual light microscopy studies has demonstrated a greater percentage of extracutaneous involvement than otherwise expected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pub_date": "1983-01-01", "authors": ["C F Winkler", "P A Bunn"], "journal": "Critical reviews in oncology/hematology", "doi": "10.1016/s1040-8428(83)80004-3", "source": "pubmed"}

The increasing prevalence of mental disorders amongst adolescents makes promotion of mental well-being and prevention interventions at schools important. UPRIGHT (Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally implemented in schools to improve and promote mental Health for Teenagers) is designed as a whole school approach (school community, students and families) to promote a culture of mental well-being and prevent mental disorders by enhancing resilience capacities. The present article aims at describing the rationale, conceptual framework, as well as methodology of implementation and evaluation of the UPRIGHT intervention. METHODS: UPRIGHT project is a research and innovation project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement No. 754919 (Duration: 48 months). The theoretical framework has been developed by an innovative and multidisciplinary approach using a co-creation process inside the UPRIGHT Consortium (involving seven institutions from Spain, Italy, Poland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland). Resulted is the UPRIGHT programme with 18 skills related to 4 components: Mindfulness, Coping, Efficacy and Social and Emotional Learning. Among the five Pan-European regions, 34 schools have been currently involved (17 control; 17 intervention) and around 6000 adolescents and their families are foreseen to participate along a 3-year period of evaluation. Effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated as a randomized controlled trial including quantitative and qualitative analysis in the five Pan-European regions representative of the cultural and socioeconomic diversity. The cost-effectiveness assessment will be performed by simulation modelling methods. DISCUSSION: We expect a short- to medium-term improvement of mental well-being in adolescents by enhancing resilience capacities. The study may provide robust evidence on intrapersonal, familiar and social environmental resilience factors promoting positive mental well-being.

It is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, and rapid detection and administration of antimicrobials have been emphasized. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic biomarkers of pediatric sepsis and the function of immune cell infiltration in the development of this illness. METHODS: Three gene expression datasets were available from the Gene Expression Omnibus collection. First, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found with the use of the R program, and then gene set enrichment analysis was carried out. Subsequently, the DEGs were combined with the major module genes chosen using the weighted gene co-expression network. The hub genes were identified by the use of three machine-learning algorithms: random forest, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The receiver operating characteristic curve and nomogram model were used to verify the discrimination and efficacy of the hub genes. In addition, the inflammatory and immune status of pediatric sepsis was assessed using cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT). The relationship between the diagnostic markers and infiltrating immune cells was further studied. RESULTS: Overall, after overlapping key module genes and DEGs, we detected 402 overlapping genes. As pediatric sepsis diagnostic indicators, CYSTM1 (AUC = 0.988), MMP8 (AUC = 0.973), and CD177 (AUC = 0.986) were investigated and demonstrated statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) and diagnostic efficacy in the validation set. As indicated by the immune cell infiltration analysis, multiple immune cells may be involved in the development of pediatric sepsis. Additionally, all diagnostic characteristics may correlate with immune cells to varying degrees. CONCLUSIONS: The candidate hub genes (CD177, CYSTM1, and MMP8) were identified, and the nomogram was constructed for pediatric sepsis diagnosis. Our study could provide potential peripheral blood diagnostic candidate genes for pediatric sepsis patients.", "pub_date": "2023-04-28", "authors": ["Wen-Yuan Zhang", "Zhong-Hua Chen", "Xiao-Xia An", "Hui Li", "Hua-Lin Zhang", "Shui-Jing Wu", "Yu-Qian Guo", "Kai Zhang", "Cong-Li Zeng", "Xiang-Ming Fang"], "journal": "World journal of pediatrics : WJP", "doi": "10.1007/s12519-023-00717-7", "source": "pubmed"}

Ziel der Studie ist es, Symptom- und Störungsverlaufsmuster zwischen Kindheit und Erwachsenenalter zu identifizieren und das Zusammenspiel von psychosozialen, biologischen und genetischen Risiko- und Schutzfaktoren bei der Entwicklung von depressiven Störungen zu untersuchen. Der vorliegende Beitrag möchte eine Übersicht über bisherige Befunde der Längsschnittstudie geben. Die bereits dreimal ausführlich untersuchte Stichprobe setzt sich aus einer in den Leipziger kinder- und jugendpsychiatrischen Kliniken rekrutierten Stichprobe und einer Bevölkerungsstichprobe zusammen. In unseren verschiedenen Teilstudien fanden wir Belege für diverse kontext-, eltern- und kindbezogene Risikofaktoren, darunter belastende Lebensereignisse, geringer sozioökonomischer Status und Depressivität der Mutter (nicht aber des Vaters). Zudem fanden wir einige charakteristische biologische und kognitiv-emotionale Merkmale von Kindern mit depressiven Störungen, wie eine geringere Cortisolausschüttung, eine geringere Einschätzung der eigenen Leistung und mehr negative Gedanken im Umgang mit anspruchsvollen Situationen, einen geringeren Selbstwert sowie eine generelle Beeinträchtigung in der emotionalen Verarbeitung menschlicher Gesichter. Nur wenige der gefundenen Faktoren stellen im engeren Sinne depressionsspezifische Risikofaktoren dar, sondern sind stattdessen als allgemeine Risikofaktoren für psychische Störungen im Kindesalter anzusehen. Bemerkenswert ist des Weiteren die Geschlechtsspezifität mancher Zusammenhänge, die einen differenzierten Blick auf Risikozusammenhänge erforderlich macht.

We aimed to compare organ dysfunction criteria in children with blood culture-proven sepsis, including emergency department, PICU, and ward patients, and to assess relevance of organ dysfunctions for mortality prediction. DESIGN: We have carried out a nonprespecified, secondary analysis of a prospective dataset collected from September 2011 to December 2015. SETTING: Emergency departments, wards, and PICUs in 10 tertiary children's hospitals in Switzerland. PATIENTS: Children younger than 17 years old with blood culture-proven sepsis. We excluded preterm infants and term infants younger than 7 days old. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC), Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2), pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA), and Pediatric Organ Dysfunction Information Update Mandate (PODIUM) scores, measured at blood culture sampling, to predict 30-day mortality. We analyzed 877 sepsis episodes in 807 children, with a 30-day mortality of 4.3%. Percentage with organ dysfunction ranged from 32.7% (IPSCC) to 55.3% (pSOFA). In adjusted analyses, the accuracy for identification of 30-day mortality was area under the curve (AUC) 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82-0.92) for IPSCC, 0.83 (0.76-0.89) for PELOD-2, 0.85 (0.78-0.92) for pSOFA, and 0.85 (0.78-0.91) for PODIUM.

Using analytic morphomic measurements from computed tomography (CT) scans, we aimed to identify specific measures of body composition associated with PTDM. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 99 non-diabetic kidney transplant recipients who received pre-transplant CT scans at a single institution between 1/2005 and 5/2014. Analytic morphomic techniques were used to measure abdominal adiposity, abdominal size, and psoas muscle area and density, standardized by gender. We measured the associations of these morphomic factors with PTDM. RESULTS: One-year incidence of PTDM was 18%. The morphomic factors significantly associated with PTDM included visceral fat area (OR=1.84 per standard deviation increase, P=.020), body depth (OR=1.79, P=.035), and total body area (OR=1.67, P=.049). Clinical factors significantly associated with PTDM included African American race (OR=3.01, P=.044), hypertension (OR=2.97, P=.041), and dialysis vintage (OR=1.24 per year on dialysis, P=.048).

Finally, GSE100159 and GSE133822 confirmed IL-17 signaling pathway-associated genes including IL-17R, TRAF6, RELB, TRAF5, CEBPB, JUNB, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were significantly up-regulated in sepsis blood samples compared with the age-matched healthy control population. Taken together, we concluded that the IL-17 signaling pathway serves as a significant potential mechanism of sepsis and provides a promising therapeutic target for sepsis treatment.

The objective of the phase 2b study B-Clear is to access the efficacy and safety of bepirovirsen in participants with chronic HBV infection. METHODS: B-Clear is a phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, partial-blind (sponsor/participant-blinded, investigator-unblinded) study in participants with chronic HBV infection receiving stable nucleos(t)ide analogue (On-NA) or not currently receiving NA therapy (Not-on-NA). Eligibility criteria included HBsAg > 100 IU/mL, HBV DNA < 90 IU/mL (On-NA) or > 2000 IU/mL (Not-on-NA), and alanine aminotransferase ≤ 2 × upper limit of normal (ULN; On-NA) or < 3 × ULN (Not-on-NA).

As a T-cell redirection therapy, clinical outcomes with teclistamab may be influenced by patient immune fitness and tumor antigen expression. We correlated tumor characteristics and baseline immune profiles with clinical response and disease burden in patients with R/RMM from the pivotal phase 1/2 MajesTEC-1 study, focusing on patients treated with 1.5 mg/kg of teclistamab (N = 165). Peripheral blood samples were collected at screening, and bone marrow samples were collected at screening and cycle 3. Better clinical outcomes to teclistamab correlated with higher baseline total T-cell counts in the periphery. In addition, responders (partial response or better) had a lower proportion of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs), T cells expressing coinhibitory receptors (CD38, PD-1, and PD-1/TIM-3), and soluble BCMA and a T-cell profile suggestive of a more cytolytic potential, compared with nonresponders. Neither frequency of baseline bone marrow BCMA expression nor BCMA-receptor density was associated with clinical response to teclistamab. Improved progression-free survival was observed in patients with a lower frequency of T cells expressing exhaustion markers and immunosuppressive Tregs. Overall, response to teclistamab was associated with baseline immune fitness; nonresponders had immune profiles suggestive of immune suppression and T-cell dysfunction.

Despite this success, a fraction of patients' experience relapse after treatment. Relapse is often preceded by recovery of healthy B cells, which suggests loss or dysfunction of CAR T-cells in bone marrow. This site is harder to access, and thus is not monitored as frequently as peripheral blood. Understanding the interplay between B cells, leukemic cells, and CAR T-cells in bone marrow is paramount in ascertaining the causes of lack of response. In this paper, we put forward a mathematical model representing the interaction between constantly renewing B cells, CAR T-cells, and leukemic cells in the bone marrow. Our model accounts for the maturation dynamics of B cells and incorporates effector and memory CAR T-cells. The model provides a plausible description of the dynamics of the various cellular compartments in bone marrow after CAR T infusion. After exploration of the parameter space, we found that the dynamics of CAR T product and disease were independent of the dose injected, initial B-cell load, and leukemia burden. We also show theoretically the importance of CAR T product attributes in determining therapy outcome, and have studied a variety of possible response scenarios, including second dosage schemes.

Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to Aβ soluble protofibrils, is being tested in persons with early Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We conducted an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial involving persons 50 to 90 years of age with early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) with evidence of amyloid on positron-emission tomography (PET) or by cerebrospinal fluid testing. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous lecanemab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline at 18 months in the score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). Key secondary end points were the change in amyloid burden on PET, the score on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90; higher scores indicate greater impairment), the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS; range, 0 to 1.97; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL; range, 0 to 53; lower scores indicate greater impairment). RESULTS: A total of 1795 participants were enrolled, with 898 assigned to receive lecanemab and 897 to receive placebo. The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, -0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.23; P<0.001). In a substudy involving 698 participants, there were greater reductions in brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo (difference, -59.1 centiloids; 95% CI, -62.6 to -55.6). Other mean differences between the two groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14 score, -1.44 (95% CI, -2.27 to -0.61; P<0.001); for the ADCOMS, -0.050 (95% CI, -0.074 to -0.027; P<0.001); and for the ADCS-MCI-ADL score, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001). Lecanemab resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions in 12.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Lecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events.

This paper highlights research about risk factors for depression in children and adolescents and links it to current knowledge about interventions aimed at preventing depression in youth. Basic epidemiologic and clinical research indicates that increased risk for depression is associated with being female; a family history of depression, particularly in a parent; subclinical depressive symptoms; anxiety; stressful life events; neurobiological dysregulation; temperament/personality (e.g., neuroticism); negative cognitions; problems in self-regulation and coping; and interpersonal dysfunction. These vulnerabilities both increase individuals' chances of encountering stress and decrease their ability to deal with the stress once it occurs. Although several existing depression-prevention studies have targeted one or more of these risk factors, the efficacy of these various prevention programs for youth with different combinations of these risk factors needs to be investigated further. Most existing depression-prevention programs in youth have used cognitive-behavioral techniques, with some success.

RESULTS: Of the 2389 total admissions to the PICU, 113 patients (4.9%) met the definition of Sepsis-3; 50.4% of the 113 patients met the definition of septic shock. Most patients (66.3%) were less than 6 years old, and 52.2% were male. Eight-five patients (75.2%) had underlying comorbidities. The respiratory system was the most common primary site of infection (57.5%). Bacterial and viral infections were the most common infectious etiology with reported rates of 29.2 and 21.2%, respectively. The median duration of PICU stay was 8 days and the 28-day PICU mortality rate was 23.9%. A Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) Score greater than four and a pre-existing percutaneous central venous catheter were associated with a significant increase in mortality, with adjusted odds ratios of 3.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.30-9.93) and 9.27 (95% confidence interval: 1.28-67.29), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of sepsis in our institution is comparable to that reported internationally; however, the mortality rate is higher than that of developed countries. Nationwide studies identifying sepsis epidemiology are needed to improve the outcome of pediatric sepsis. Following international guidelines for central-line insertion and maintenance is of paramount importance.", "pub_date": "2021-05-07", "authors": ["Mohamed O Humoodi", "Mona A Aldabbagh", "Maher M Salem", "Yousef M Al Talhi", "Sara M Osman", "Mohammed Bakhsh", "Abdullah M Alzahrani", "Maha Azzam"], "journal": "BMC pediatrics", "doi": "10.1186/s12887-021-02686-0", "source": "pubmed"}

CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in the treatment of R/R childhood B-ALL, although the majority of reports have been in noninfant patients. Barriers to the successful implementation of CAR T-cell therapy in infant B-ALL include challenges related to apheresis, product manufacturing, and disease-specific considerations such as lineage switch.

However, little is known about its pathophysiological mechanisms. Evidence from chronic fatigue syndrome and studies on sickness behaviour suggest that immune and neuroendocrine factors may play a causative role in the development of fatigue. METHODS: We compared whole blood stimulatory capacity for pro- (TNFalpha, IFNgamma) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) as well as hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function in 15 MS patients with marked fatigue and 15 patients without fatigue as determined by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). RESULTS: Proinflammatory cytokines were significantly higher (TNFalpha: 478.9 v 228.2 pg/ml, p = 0.01; IFNgamma: 57.6 v 27.8 pg/ml; p = 0.01) in MS patients with fatigue. Furthermore, TNFalpha values significantly correlated with daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (r = 0.64, p = 0.001). Controlling for disease activity (as measured by the Cambridge Multiple Sclerosis Basic Score), disease duration, Expanded Disability Status Scale, and depression further increased the correlation of cytokine production and fatigue. HPA axis activity was not related to fatigue but was modestly correlated with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that fatigue in MS is at least partially mediated through activation of proinflammatory cytokines. In line with earlier findings, HPA axis dysfunction seems not to be relevant in MS fatigue pathogenesis but appears to be linked to cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest that increased levels of inflammatory cytokines may be involved in MS fatigue.

Most patients with CTCL are negative for antibodies to the structural proteins of HTLV-I, and thus a causative role for this virus is usually dismissed. However, the Tax sequence of HTLV-I has been found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of practically all patients with CTCL. Such patients express Tax mRNA and have antibodies to p40Tax, the protein encoded by this sequence. Sequence analysis of a 159-bp region of Tax extracted from CTCL cells proved to be homologous with the same region prepared from a cell line infected with prototypic HTLV-I. By in situ PCR, Tax has been demonstrated in the lymphocytes infiltrating the skin as well as in the keratinocytes of such patients. Apart from the pathophysiologic and clinical interest of these studies, these observations may have therapeutic implications. In vitro, the proliferation of HTLV-I-transformed cells can be inhibited by antisense to HTLV-I Tax.

In the phase 1 dose-defining portion of the study, teclistamab showed promising efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. METHODS: In this phase 1-2 study, we enrolled patients who had relapsed or refractory myeloma after at least three therapy lines, including triple-class exposure to an immunomodulatory drug, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody. Patients received a weekly subcutaneous injection of teclistamab (at a dose of 1.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) after receiving step-up doses of 0.06 mg and 0.3 mg per kilogram. The primary end point was the overall response (partial response or better). RESULTS: Among 165 patients who received teclistamab, 77.6% had triple-class refractory disease (median, five previous therapy lines). With a median follow-up of 14.1 months, the overall response rate was 63.0%, with 65 patients (39.4%) having a complete response or better. A total of 44 patients (26.7%) were found to have no minimal residual disease (MRD); the MRD-negativity rate among the patients with a complete response or better was 46%.

Disease resistance or relapse after successful initial therapy and declining efficacy of subsequent rounds of treatment were the basis for the development of alternative anti-CD20-based antibody therapies. AREAS COVERED: The novel anti-CD20 antibodies of atumumab, ublituximab, and obinutuzumab were developed to be differentiated via structural and mechanistic features over rituximab. We provide an overview of preclinical and clinical data, and demonstrate ways in which the pharmacodynamic properties of these novel agents translate into clinical benefit for patients. EXPERT OPINION: Of the novel anti-CD20 antibodies, only obinutuzumab has shown consistently improved efficacy over rituximab in randomized pivotal trials in indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The Phase 3 GALLIUM trial demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival with obinutuzumab-based immunochemotherapy over rituximab-based immunochemotherapy. Novel combinations of obinutuzumab, including with chemotherapy-free options are being explored, such as with the newly approved combinations of obinutuzumab with venetoclax, ibrutinib, or acalabrutinib.

One of the most widely used scoring systems to assess mortality in sepsis or septic shock is Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD-2). However, it requires various laboratory evaluations. A non-invasive, fast and easy method is needed to assess the mortality of children with septic shock at an early stage. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the ability of Vascular Reactivity Index (VRI) compared with PELOD-2 score as a predictor of mortality in children with septic shock based on vascular response to vasoactive agents. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from children aged 1 month to 18 years with septic shock treated in the ER and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the tertiary hospital from 2017 to 2021. The serial haemodynamic data were analysed including Systemic Vascular Resistant Index (SVRI) and the cardiac index from ultrasound cardiac output monitoring device was recorded in the first and sixth hours after the diagnosis of septic shock. The VRI was determined by dividing SVRI/Vasoactive Inotropic Score (ie, accumulated doses of dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, milrinone, vasopressin and norepinephrine). The receiver operating curve was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off point. RESULTS: A total of 68 subjects fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the median age was 54 months with a range of 2-204 months and the mortality rate was 47%. The majority of the patients who died were found in the high cardiac index and low SVRI group (17.6%). Moreover, the optimum cut-off point of VRI was obtained to predict mortality in septic shock of 32.1, with 87.5% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. The AUC for predicting death using VRI was 95% (95% CI 90% to 100%, p<0.001) and PELOD-2 92.6% (95% CI 96.4% to 98.8%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The VRI <32.1 may potentially be used to predict mortality in children with septic shock and its predictive ability is as good as PELOD-2.

There have been few studies that have examined the rate of self-harm and mental-health correlates among community-based youth. We performed a population-based study to determine the prevalence of nonsuicidal self-harm, its mental-health correlates and help-seeking behaviour. METHODS: We used data from the Victoria Healthy Youth Survey, a population-based longitudinal survey of youth aged 14-21 in Victoria, British Columbia. The survey included questions about the history, method, frequency, age of onset and help-seeking for nonsuicidal self-harm. Youth were interviewed between February and June 2005. Univariable group differences were analyzed using students t test for continuous data and chi2 for binary or categorical data. Multivariate analyses were conducted by use of multivariate analysis of variance and logistic regression. RESULTS: Ninety-six of 568 (16.9%) youth indicated that they had ever harmed themselves. Self-injuries such as cutting, scratching and self-hitting were the most common forms of nonsuicidal self-harm (83.2%). The mean age of onset was 15.2 years. Of those who reported nonsuicidal self-harm, 56% had sought help for this behaviour. Participants who reported 5 or more symptoms (out of 6) in a given symptom category were more likely than those who reported less than 5 symptoms to report nonsuicidal self-harm for the following categories: depressive mood (odds ratio [OR] 2.18, confidence interval [CI] 1.28-3.7) and problems with regulation of attention, impulsivity and activity (OR 2.24, CI 1.33-3.76).

In this study, we evaluate the biomarkers of early PD diagnosis, disease progression, and treatment effect collected in the SPARK. METHODS: Cinpanemab is a human-derived monoclonal antibody binding preferentially to aggregated forms of extracellular α-synuclein. SPARK was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 multicenter trial evaluating 3 cinpanemab doses administered intravenously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks with an active treatment dose-blind extension period for up to 112 weeks. SPARK enrolled 357 participants diagnosed with PD within 3 years, aged 40-80 years, ≤2.5 on the modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, and with evidence of striatal dopaminergic deficit. The primary outcome was change from baseline in the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale total score. Secondary and exploratory biomarker outcomes evaluated change from baseline at week 52 relative to placebo. Dopamine transporter SPECT and MRI were used to quantify changes in the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and regional atrophy. CSF and plasma samples were used to assess change in total α-synuclein levels, α-synuclein seeding, and neurofilament light chain levels. SPARK was conducted from January 2018 to April 2021 and terminated due to lack of efficacy. RESULTS: Approximately 3.8% (15/398) of SPECT-imaged participants did not have evidence of dopaminergic deficit and were screen-failed. Binary classification of α-synuclein seeding designated 93% (110/118) of the enrolled CSF subgroup as positive for α-synuclein seeds at baseline. Clinical disease progression was observed, with no statistically significant difference in cinpanemab groups compared with that in placebo. Ninety-nine percent of participants with positive α-synuclein seeding remained positive through week 52. No statistically significant changes from baseline were observed between treatment groups and placebo across biomarker measures. Broadly, there was minimal annual change with high interindividual variability across biomarkers-with striatal binding ratios of the ipsilateral putamen showing the greatest mean change/SD over time. DISCUSSION: Biomarker results indicated enrollment of the intended population with early PD, but there was no significant correlation with disease progression or clear evidence of a cinpanemab treatment effect on biomarker measures. Suitable biomarkers for evaluating disease severity and progression in early PD trials are still needed.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were performed, followed by a 6-week recovery phase. Participants were counseled that they could not rely on the drug for contraception. RESULTS: Fifty-seven participants were offered acceptability surveys (39 DMAU, 18 placebo). Most respondents, 80% (45/56), reported satisfaction with the method; 77% (44/57) would recommend it. 54% (31/57), reported that, if available, they would use the method as their primary contraceptive. More respondents reported satisfaction with active DMAU than placebo (87% vs. 67%; p = 0.05). Most respondents, 91% (52/57), reported no difficulty with having to take up to 4 pills within 30 min of ingesting a high-fat meal. CONCLUSION: Most participants reported that the study method, daily oral DMAU or placebo, was satisfactory and acceptable. Having to take the drug after a high-fat meal did not detract from acceptability. IMPLICATIONS: Most participants in a 4-week trial of daily DMAU capsules would recommend and use the method. High satisfaction among DMAU and placebo groups affirms acceptability of a daily male contraceptive pill, warranting further study of oral DMAU.", "pub_date": "2020-04-13", "authors": ["Brian T Nguyen", "Maritza T Farrant", "Bradley D Anawalt", "Fiona Yuen", "Arthi Thirumalai", "John K Amory", "Ronald S Swerdloff", "William J Bremner", "Peter Y Liu", "Diana L Blithe", "Stephanie T Page", "Christina Wang"], "journal": "Contraception", "doi": "10.1016/j.contraception.2020.04.006", "source": "pubmed"}

Retrospective case-note review of all cases with cannabis related diagnosis over a 11 -year period, for subjects presenting to a tertiary psychiatric hospital in southern India was carried out. Information pertaining to sociodemographic, personal, social, substance-use related, psychiatric and treatment histories, was gathered. Standardized diagnoses were made according to Diagnostic Criteria for Research of the World Health Organization, on the basis of information available.Cannabis abuse is associated with widespread psychiatric morbidity that spans the major categories of mental disorders under the ICD-10 system, although proportion of patients with psychotic disorders far outweighed those with non-psychotic disorders. Whilst paranoid psychoses were more prevalent, a significant number of patients with affective psychoses, particularly mania, was also noted.Besides being known as either the causative agent or a potent risk factor in cases of paranoid psychoses, cannabis appears to have similar capabilities with regard to affective psychoses, particularly in cases of mania. It is suggested that cannabis has the potential to act as a \"life event stressor\" amongst subjects vulnerable to develop affective psychoses and the possible aetiopathogenesis of such a finding is discussed.", "pub_date": "2003-07-01", "authors": ["Jaydip Sarkar", "Pratima Murthy", "Swaran P Singh"], "journal": "Indian journal of psychiatry", "doi": "", "source": "pubmed"}

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence, aetiology and outcomes of physician-diagnosed sepsis in hospitalised neonates who had previously been discharged home after delivery in Soweto, South Africa. METHODS: A retrospective review using data abstracted from clinical and laboratory databases identified physician-diagnosed sepsis cases in neonates admitted to the general paediatric wards at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital from January 2015 to September 2016. Neonates with physician-diagnosed sepsis were categorised into two groups based on putative pathogens recovered from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid specimens: (i) culture-confirmed sepsis; and (ii) culture-negative sepsis. RESULTS: Of 1 826 neonatal admissions, 1 025 (56.2%) had physician-diagnosed sepsis: 166 (16.2%) with culture-confirmed sepsis and 859 (83.8%) with culture-negative neonatal sepsis. The commonest pathogens causing culture-confirmed neonatal sepsis were Streptococcus viridans (n=53; 26.5%), S. agalactiae (n=38; 19.0%), and Staphylococcus aureus (n=25; 12.5%). The case fatality rates for culture-confirmed sepsis and culture-negative sepsis were 10.8% (18/166) and 2.6% (22/859), respectively. The odds of death occurring during hospitalisation was 10-fold (95% confidence interval 3.7 - 26.9) higher in neonates with culture-confirmed sepsis compared with culture-negative sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, physician-diagnosed sepsis represents a huge disease burden in previously healthy neonates hospitalised from home.

Suitable therapies and support are needed both to prevent sepsis and to prevent multiple organ failure. After bacterial infection, pro-inflammatory cytokines trigger the antimicrobial activity of macrophages and neutrophils, resulting in production of reactive species such as H2O2, NO, superoxide and peroxynitrite. However, excess production can lead to host tissue damage. Incubation of either hepatocytes or heart mitochondria from neonatal rats with these reactive species, or with cytokines, leads to impairment of mitochondrial oxidative function, and in an animal model of neonatal sepsis similar results to the in vitro findings have been demonstrated. Recent in vivo studies, using indirect calorimetry of suckling rat pups, show that during endotoxaemia there is a profound hypometabolism, associated with hypothermia. Having determined that cellular oxidative function may be impaired during sepsis, it is of great importance to try to identify therapeutic measures. Much interest has been shown in glutamine, which may become essential during sepsis. It has been shown that hepatic glutamine is rapidly depleted during endotoxaemia. When hepatocytes from endotoxaemic rats were incubated with glutamine, there was a restoration of mitochondrial structure and metabolism. In vivo, intraperitoneal injection of glutamine into endotoxic suckling rats partially reversed hypometabolism, markedly reduced the incidence of hypothermia and improved clinical status. These results suggest that glutamine has a beneficial effect during sepsis in neonates.", "pub_date": "2003-08-01", "authors": ["Simon Eaton"], "journal": "The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society", "doi": "10.1079/PNS2003284", "source": "pubmed"}

Autologous MSCs may be a better cell source and have been studied for the treatment of cerebral palsy because of their functions in tissue repair and the regulation of immunological processes. METHODS: To assess neural stem cell-like (NSC-like) cells derived from autologous marrow mesenchymal stem cells as a novel treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe cerebral palsy, a total of 60 cerebral palsy patients were enrolled in this open-label, non-randomised, observer-blinded controlled clinical study with a 6-months follow-up. For the transplantation group, a total of 30 cerebral palsy patients received an autologous NSC-like cells transplantation (1-2 × 107 cells into the subarachnoid cavity) and rehabilitation treatments whereas 30 patients in the control group only received rehabilitation treatment. RESULTS: We recorded the gross motor function measurement scores, language quotients, and adverse events up to 6 months post-treatment. The gross motor function measurement scores in the transplantation group were significantly higher at month 3 (the score increase was 42.6, 95% CI: 9.8-75.3, P=.011) and month 6 (the score increase was 58.6, 95% CI: 25.8-91.4, P=.001) post-treatment compared with the baseline scores. The increase in the Gross Motor Function Measurement scores in the control group was not significant. The increases in the language quotients at months 1, 3, and 6 post-treatment were not statistically significant when compared with the baseline quotients in both groups.

Psychopathology and psychiatric syndromes associated with cannabis use that have received research attention in recent years include cannabis withdrawal, cannabis and psychotic disorders (especially schizophrenia), depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. Status of a specific cannabis withdrawal syndrome and a specific 'cannabis psychosis' remains controversial. Current evidence indicates that there is a clinically significant association between cannabis use disorders and psychotic syndromes, depression, anxiety and possibly mild cognitive impairment. However, the nature of this association is often not clear. Several hypothesis related to the cannabis-schizophrenia association are examined.

These effects contrast with those of conventional anticoagulants, which may exhibit adverse events of untoward bleeding precluding treatment in some patients. A variety of investigational pharmacological modalities have been developed and studied to target factor XIa. SUMMARY: Asundexian is a small molecule inhibitor of factor XIa that has been evaluated in several clinical studies. It has been studied as an oral, once-daily medication and found to inhibit approximately 90% of factor XIa activity at doses of 20 to 50 mg. Phase 2 trials have demonstrated the potential for improved safety compared to standard of care in certain treatment settings, such as in atrial fibrillation. For other indications, such as noncardioembolic stroke and acute myocardial infarction, asundexian has been used in addition to background antiplatelet therapy. In these instances, asundexian did not show a difference in the incidence of bleeding events compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: Phase 3 trials have recently been launched; however, the OCEANIC-AF trial was prematurely discontinued due to inefficacy of asundexian vs apixaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Another phase 3 trial, OCEANIC-AFINA, is planned to compare asundexian to placebo in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk for stroke who are deemed ineligible for anticoagulation.", "pub_date": "2024-12-01", "authors": ["Jocelyn Edwards", "Jack Corey", "James C Coons"], "journal": "American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists", "doi": "10.1093/ajhp/zxae182", "source": "pubmed"}

We assessed population-based incidence and outcomes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis in children in Switzerland. METHODS: We did a multicentre, prospective, cohort study at ten paediatric hospitals in Switzerland. We included neonates and children younger than 17 years with blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis. Children were eligible if they met criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome-according to 2005 paediatric consensus definition- at the time of blood culture sampling. Incidence was calculated by dividing the number of annual sepsis episodes in the study for the years 2012-15 by the end-of-year resident paediatric population in Switzerland. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in the first 30 days after sepsis onset. FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2011, and Dec 31, 2015, we enrolled 1096 children to our study. Of 1181 episodes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis, 382 (32%) occurred in 379 previously healthy children, 402 (34%) in 391 neonates, and 397 (34%) in 341 children with comorbidities. Incidence was 25·1 cases per 100 000 (95% CI 23·8-26·4) in children and 146·0 cases per 100 000 (133·2-159·6) in neonates. Central line-associated bloodstream infections and primary bloodstream infections accounted for 569 (48%) of 1181 episodes, and organ dysfunction was present in 455 (39%) of 1181 episodes. Escherichia coli (242 of 1181 [20%]), Staphylococcus aureus (177 of 1181 [15%]), coagulase-negative staphylococci (135 of 1181 [11%]), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (118 of 1181 [10%]) were the most prevalent pathogens in our study, accounting for 57% of episodes. The overall case-fatality ratio was 7% (82 of 1181 episodes; 95% CI 5·6-8·6), and it was higher in neonates (11%, 45 of 402 episodes; 8·4-14·8; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 4·41, 95% CI 1·75-11·1) and children with comorbidities (7%, 27 of 397 episodes; 4·6-9·9; OR 4·97, 1·84-13·4) compared with previously healthy children (3%, ten of 382 episodes; 1·3-4·9). The case-fatality ratio was 1% (five of 726 episodes [95% CI 0·3-1·7]) for children without organ dysfunction, which increased to 17% (77 of 455 episodes [13·7-20·8]) when organ dysfunction was present (adjusted OR 4·84, 95% CI 1·40-16·7). INTERPRETATION: The burden of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis on child health remains considerable. We recorded key differences in predominant organisms, severity, and outcome between neonates, previously healthy children, and children with comorbidities. Although for most episodes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis, no organ dysfunction was seen, presence of organ dysfunction was strongly associated with mortality.

This child and adolescent psychiatric unit has the whole country as a catchment area for patients <16 years. Gender-confirming medical interventions are regulated by a special law that sets a minimum age for legal and surgical gender reassignment to 18 years. The law, which is under revision, does not prevent medical investigations, hormonal therapy, and some surgical procedures before the age of 18. Gender dysphoria is defined as a persistent desire to live and be accepted as the opposite sex, usually accompanied by a perceived inconsistency with the sex assigned at birth and a desire to change the body in accordance with the perceived sex. The cause is unknown despite attempts of etiological mapping including genetic analyses, hormonal studies and modern brain imaging techniques. Repeated studies have shown that only a minority (about 20 %) of prepubertal children with gender dysphoria will have a persistent desire for later gender-confirming medical interventions, while the majority of those whose gender dysphoria is reinforced during puberty will later meet the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria (DSM-5) and transsexualism (ICD-10) (so called persisters). Persisters can be offered treatment with puberty stopping hormones to avoid the development of undesirable secondary sexual characteristics. Gender-confirming medical interventions are the only recommended treatment for gender dysphoria, and early treatment facilitates the ability to successfully pass in the desired sex, which is associated with a significantly better prognosis.", "pub_date": "2017-02-22", "authors": ["Louise Frisén", "Olle Söder", "Per-Anders Rydelius"], "journal": "Lakartidningen", "doi": "", "source": "pubmed"}

There has been considerable interest in the role of tyrosine kinase signaling as mediators of pro- and antifibrotic processes. Nintedanib is a nonspecific tyrosine kinase that has been shown to have therapeutic benefit in lung fibrosis. However, the precise mechanism of action remains unclear because nintedanib inhibits several tyrosine kinases, which are often expressed on multiple cell types with different activities during fibrosis. Discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) has been suggested as a potential target of nintedanib. DDR2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by fibrillar collagens such as type I collagen. DDR2 is primarily expressed by fibroblasts. The effectiveness of specifically targeting DDR2 signaling during fibrosis remains undefined. In the present study, we show that nintedanib acts as a direct and indirect inhibitor of DDR2. We then utilize a novel allosteric inhibitor of DDR2, WRG-28, which blocks ligand binding and activation of DDR2. We find that WRG-28 augments fibroblast apoptosis and attenuates fibrosis. Finally, we show that fibroblast type I collagen autocrine signaling is regulated by DDR2 through both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions of DDR2. These findings highlight the importance of type I collagen autocrine signaling by fibroblasts during fibrosis and demonstrate that DDR2 has a central role in this pathway making it a potential therapeutic target.", "pub_date": "2023-07-25", "authors": ["Song Ling", "Doyun Kwak", "Kevin K Kim"], "journal": "American journal of physiology.

An established measure of inter-class deviation, the enrichment score, is usually computed using a weighted running sum statistic over the whole set of gene symbols. Due to the lack of analytic expressions the significance of enrichment scores is determined using a non-parametric estimation of their null distribution by permuting the phenotype labels of the probed patients. Accordingly, GSEA is a time-consuming task due to the large number of required permutations to accurately estimate the nominal p-value - a circumstance that is even more pronounced during multiple hypothesis testing since its estimate is lower-bounded by the inverse number of samples in permutation space. RESULTS: We present rapidGSEA - a software suite consisting of two tools for facilitating permutation-based GSEA: cudaGSEA and ompGSEA. cudaGSEA is a CUDA-accelerated tool using fine-grained parallelization schemes on massively parallel architectures while ompGSEA is a coarse-grained multi-threaded tool for multi-core CPUs. Nominal p-value estimation of 4,725 gene sets on a data set consisting of 20,639 unique gene symbols and 200 patients (183 cases + 17 controls) each probing one million permutations takes 19 hours on a Xeon CPU and less than one hour on a GeForce Titan X GPU while the established GSEA tool from the Broad Institute (broadGSEA) takes roughly 13 days.

Black adolescents are likely to have untreated depression due to social network influences, varied perceptions of services and providers, or self-stigma associated with experiencing depressive symptoms. Furthermore, if or when treatment is initiated, low engagement and early termination are common. To address this gap, a trial is being conducted to preliminarily test the effectiveness of an engagement intervention targeting Black adolescents with depression in school mental health services in New York City. METHODS: A total of 60 Black middle and high school adolescents displaying depressive symptoms are equally randomized (based on school site) to the treatment arms. Both trial arms deliver Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents (IPT-A), a time-limited, evidence-based treatment for depression. Additionally, one arm pairs IPT-A with a brief, multi-level engagement intervention, the Making Connections Intervention (MCI), involving adolescents, caregivers, and clinicians. Outcomes of interest are group differences in depression and suicide ideation, adolescent and caregiver engagement, and mental health service use.

The development of therapeutic strategies to treat cancer cachexia has always been related to clinical interventions with increased food intake/supplementation, physical exercise regimens, and/or medication to attenuate catabolism and increase the anabolic response. However, the approval of drugs by regulatory agencies has always been a challenge. AREAS COVERED: This review outlines the main pharmacotherapy findings in cancer cachexia as well as the ongoing clinical trials that have evaluated changes in body composition and muscle function. The National Library of Medicine (PubMed) was used as search tool. EXPERT OPINION: The pharmacological therapy for cachexia should be focused on improving body composition, muscle function, and mortality, although none of the compounds used so far was able to demonstrate positive results beyond increased appetite and improvements in body composition. Ponsegromab (GDF15 inhibitor), a new compound that has just entered a phase II clinical trial, is a promising candidate to treat cancer cachexia and may produce exciting results if the study can be conducted as planned.", "pub_date": "2023-03-30", "authors": ["Guilherme Wesley Peixoto da Fonseca", "Ryosuke Sato", "Maria Janieire de Nazaré Nunes Alves", "Stephan von Haehling"], "journal": "Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy", "doi": "10.1080/14656566.2023.2194489", "source": "pubmed"}

There has been a debate in psychiatry about whether or not we can infer a cause-and-effect relationship between the use of cannabis and psychotic disorders. In this editorial, we first present and critically discuss the evidence to date of the association between heavy cannabis use and psychosis. We argue that while the biological mechanisms underlying individual susceptibility to develop a psychotic disorder following heavy cannabis use are still unknown, heavy cannabis use remains the most modifiable risk factor for the onset of psychotic disorders and for its clinical and functional outcome.

DESIGN: A multicentre randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care units in teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Forty-eight infants and children with severe sepsis. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive plasma filtration (n = 25) or standard therapy (n = 23) for the treatment of septic shock. The primary outcome measure was 28-day survival. Secondary outcome measures included the number of failed organ systems on Day 7, a requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and the modified Glasgow outcome score (MGOS) at 6 months (where 1 is normal and 6 is dead). RESULTS: The trial was stopped early due to poor recruitment. Patients in the plasma filtration group had higher initial disease severity as measured by serum lactate level, inotrope score and MGOS. Ten (40%) children died in the plasma filtration group and 4 (17%) died in the control group. With intention-to-treat analysis and adjustment for lactate level, ventilation index, inotrope score and MGOS at admission using logistic regression, the odds ratio for death with plasma filtration was 1.20 (95% CI, 0.23-6.20; P = 0.82). The median number of failing organ systems at 7 days was 2 (interquartile range [IQR], 1-4) in the plasma filtration group versus 2 (IQR, 1-3) in the control group. Two children in the plasma filtration group required ECMO for 2.5 and 123 hours, and one child in the control group required ECMO for 45 hours. The median MGOS at 6 months was 4 (IQR, 2-6) in the plasma filtration group and 2 (IQR, 1-4) in the control group.

The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7th Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD ± 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged .16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged .15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called 'invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised riskbehaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the \"invisible\" risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression.

This first-in-patient (phase Ib), 24-week study assessed use of ponsegromab, a mAb against GDF-15, in adults with advanced cancer, cachexia, and elevated GDF-15 serum concentration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants (n = 10) received open-label ponsegromab subcutaneous 200 mg every 3 weeks for 12 weeks in addition to standard-of-care anticancer treatment. Ponsegromab safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics were assessed in addition to serum GDF-15 concentrations and exploratory measures of efficacy. RESULTS: No treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events, injection site reactions, or adverse trends in clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, or electrocardiogram parameters attributable to ponsegromab were identified. Median serum unbound GDF-15 concentration at baseline was 2.269 ng/mL. Following initiation of study treatment, median unbound GDF-15 concentrations were below the lower limit of quantification (0.0424 ng/mL) from day 1 (3 hours postdose) through week 15.

There is a need for research on treatments that are helpful for these mixed difficulties, especially for school-age children. Emotion Regulation (ER) difficulties present across a wide range of mental health disorders and mentalizing may help with regulation. The ability to mentalize one's own experiences and those of others plays a key role in coping with stress, regulation of emotions, and the formation of stable relationships. Mentalization Based Therapy (MBT) is a well-evidenced therapy that aims to promote mentalization, which in turn increases ER capacities, leading to decreased emotional and behavioural difficulties. The aim of this study is to test the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of MBT compared to treatment as usual for school age children with emotional and behavioural difficulties. If effective, we hope this approach can become available to the growing number of children presenting to mental health services with a mix of emotional and behavioural difficulties.

However, ITB pump surgery is associated with one of the highest rates of surgical site infection (SSI) in medicine, leading to significant morbidity and expense. Surgical protocols have reduced the rate of SSI in children with other CNS implants, and single-center protocols have been effective in ITB surgery in pediatrics. The authors describe the first multicenter quality improvement (QI)-driven standardized protocol for ITB pump surgery in children with CP across the Cerebral Palsy Research Network (CPRN), implemented with the aim of reducing ITB-associated SSI. METHODS: SSI was defined as a culture-positive infection, ITB pump system removal for suspected infection, or wound dehiscence with exposed hardware. Each center reported historical infection rates for at least 3 years before initiating the SSI protocol (preintervention phase). After initiation of a 13-step surgical protocol, a consecutive series of 130 patients undergoing 149 surgical procedures for ITB at four CPRN tertiary pediatric neurosurgery centers were prospectively enrolled at surgery during a 2-year study period (intervention phase). QI methodology was used, including development of a key driver diagram and tracking performance using run and control charts. The primary process measure goal was documented compliance with 80% of the protocol steps, and the primary outcome measure goal was a 20% reduction in 90-day infection rate. Patient characteristics were collected from the CPRN Research Electronic Data Capture registry, including age at surgery, BMI, Gross Motor Function Classification System level, and pattern of spasticity. RESULTS: The aggregated preintervention 90-day ITB SSI rate was 4.9% (223 procedures) between 2014 and 2017. During the intervention phase, 136 of 149 ITB surgeries performed met inclusion criteria for analysis. The mean documented compliance rate with protocol steps was 75%, and the 90-day infection rate was 4.4%, with an average of 42 days from index surgery to infection. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first multicenter QI initiative designed to reduce SSI in ITB surgery in children with CP.

Its symptoms mainly include any combination of stiffness, nocturnal pain, and limitation of active and passive glenohumeral joint movement. Conventional treatment options for FS are physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, injection therapy, and arthroscopic capsular release, but adverse and limited effects continue to present problems. As a result, pharmacoacupuncture (PA) is getting attention as an alternative therapy for patients with FS. PA is a new form of acupuncture treatment in traditional Korean medicine (TKM) that is mainly used for musculoskeletal diseases. It has similarity and specificity compared to corticosteroid injection and hydrodilatation, making it a potential alternative injection therapy for FS. However, no systematic reviews investigating the utilization of PA for FS have been published. Therefore, this review aims to standardize the clinical use of PA for FS and validate its therapeutic effect. METHODS: The protocol was registered in Prospero (CRD42023445708) on 18 July 2023. Until Aug. 31, 2023, seven electronic databases will be searched for randomized controlled trials of PA for FS. Authors will be contacted, and manual searches will also be performed. Two reviewers will independently screen and collect data from retrieved articles according to predefined criteria. The primary outcome will be pain intensity, and secondary outcomes will be effective rate, Constant-Murley Score, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index, range of motion, quality of life, and adverse events. Bias and quality of the included trials will be assessed using the Cochrane handbook's risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. Meta analyses will be conducted using Review Manager V.5.3 software. GRADE will be used to evaluate the level of evidence for each outcome. RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted following PRISMA statement. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: This review will provide scientific evidence to support health insurance policy as well as the standardization of PA in clinical practice.", "pub_date": "2024-03-01", "authors": ["Ji-Ho Lee", "Hyeon-Sun Park", "Sang-Hyeon Park", "Dong-Ho Keum", "Seo-Hyun Park"], "journal": "Journal of pharmacopuncture", "doi": "10.3831/KPI.2024.27.1.14", "source": "pubmed"}

A pediatric adaptation of SOFA (pSOFA) showed excellent discrimination for mortality in critically ill children but has not been evaluated in an emergency department (ED) population. OBJECTIVE: To delineate test characteristics of the pSOFA score for predicting in-hospital mortality among (1) all patients and (2) patients with suspected infection treated in pediatric EDs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study took place from January 1, 2012, to January 31, 2020 in 9 US children's hospitals included in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry. The data was analyzed from February 1, 2020, to April 18, 2022. All ED visits for patients younger than 18 years were included. EXPOSURES: ED pSOFA score was assigned by summing maximum pSOFA organ dysfunction components during ED stay (each 0-4 points). In the subset with suspected infection, visit meeting criteria for sepsis (suspected infection with a pSOFA score of 2 or more) and septic shock (suspected infection with vasoactive infusion and serum lactate level >18.0 mg/dL) were identified. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Test characteristics of pSOFA scores of 2 or more during the ED stay for hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 3 999 528 (female, 47.3%) ED visits were included. pSOFA scores ranged from 0 to 16, with 126 250 visits (3.2%) having a pSOFA score of 2 or more. pSOFA scores of 2 or more had sensitivity of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.62-0.67) and specificity of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.97-0.97), with negative predictive value of 1.0 (95% CI, 1.00-1.00) in predicting hospital mortality. Of 642 868 patients with suspected infection (16.1%), 42 992 (6.7%) met criteria for sepsis, and 374 (0.1%) met criteria for septic shock. Hospital mortality rates for suspected infection (599 502), sepsis (42 992), and septic shock (374) were 0.0%, 0.9%, and 8.0%, respectively. The pSOFA score had similar discrimination for hospital mortality in all ED visits (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.79-0.82) and the subset with suspected infection (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.80-0.84). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a large, multicenter study of pediatric ED visits, a pSOFA score of 2 or more was uncommon and associated with increased hospital mortality yet had poor sensitivity as a screening tool for hospital mortality. Conversely, children with a pSOFA score of 2 or less were at very low risk of death, with high specificity and negative predictive value. Among patients with suspected infection, patients with pSOFA-defined septic shock demonstrated the highest mortality.", "pub_date": "2022-07-01", "authors": ["Fran Balamuth", "Halden F Scott", "Scott L Weiss", "Michael Webb", "James M Chamberlain", "Lalit Bajaj", "Holly Depinet", "Robert W Grundmeier", "Diego Campos", "Sara J Deakyne Davies", "Norma Jean Simon", "Lawrence J Cook", "Elizabeth R Alpern"], "journal": "JAMA pediatrics", "doi": "10.1001/jamapediatrics.2022.1301", "source": "pubmed"}

Identification of the common bacteria causing such infections and their susceptibility patterns will provide necessary information for timely intervention. This study is aimed at determining the susceptibilities of bacterial etiological agents to commonly-used antimicrobial agents for empirical treatment of suspected bacterial septicaemia in children. METHODS: This is a hospital based retrospective analysis of blood cultures from infants to children up to 14 years of age with preliminary diagnosis of sepsis and admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and Paediatric Wards of the Teaching Hospital Tamale from July 2011 to January 2012. RESULTS: Out of 331 blood specimens cultured, the prevalence of confirmed bacterial sepsis was 25.9% (86/331). Point prevalence for confirmed cases from NICU was 44.4% (28/63) and 21.6% (58/268) from the Paediatric ward. Gram positive cocci (GPC) were the predominant isolates with Coagulase positive (32.2%) and Coagulase-negative (28.7%) Staphylococci accounting for 60.9% of the total isolates. Gram negative rods (GNR) comprised 39.1% of all isolates with Klebsiella, E.coli and Salmonella being the most common organisms isolated. Klebsiella was the most frequent GNR from the NICU and Salmonella typhi was predominantly isolated from the paediatric ward. Acinetobacter showed 100.0% susceptibility to Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime but was resistant (100.0%) to Ampicillin, Tetracycline and Cotrimoxazole. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella were 80.0% and 91.0% susceptible to Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime respectively. Klebsiella species showed 8.3% susceptibility to Tetracycline but was resistant to Ampicillin and Cotrimoxazole. Escherichia coli showed 40.0% susceptibility to Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol and Cotrimoxazole; 20.0% susceptibility to Tetracycline and 80.0% susceptible to Gentamicin and Cefuroxime. Coagulase negative Staphylococci was susceptible to Gentamicin (72.0%) but Coagulase positive Staphylococci showed intermediate sensitivity to Gentamicin (42.9%). CONCLUSION: Coagulase Negative, Coagulase Positive Staphylococci, Salmonella and Klebsiella were the aetiological agents of bloodstream infection among children at TTH. While gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria showed low susceptibility to Ampicillin, Tetracycline and Cotrimoxazole, the GNR were susceptible to Gentamicin and third-generation cephalosporins.", "pub_date": "2013-02-18", "authors": ["Samuel E K Acquah", "Lawrence Quaye", "Kenneth Sagoe", "Juventus B Ziem", "Patricia I Bromberger", "Anthony A Amponsem"], "journal": "BMC infectious diseases", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2334-13-89", "source": "pubmed"}

We examined the association between maternal and paternal depression, and the timing of their depression (before or after the child's birth) and outcomes for the child including incidence of child depression and poor educational attainment. METHODS: A linked routine data cohort study linking General Practitioner(GP), hospital and education records of young people (aged 0 to 30 years) in Wales. Parental and child diagnosis of depression was identified from GP data. Regression analysis examined the association of maternal and paternal depression with time to diagnosis of depression in the child and odds of attaining educational milestones. OUTCOMES: In adjusted models, the relative risk of offspring developing depression was 1.22 if the mother had depression before the child was born, 1.55 if the mother had depression after the child was born and 1.73 if she had depression both before and after the child was born (chronic depression), compared to those were there was no maternal depression history. For achieving milestones at end of primary school, odds were 0.92, 0.88 and 0.79 respectively. Association of depression in the child was similar if the male living in the household had depression with risk ratios of 1.24 (before), 1.43 (after) and 1.27 (before and after) for child diagnosed depression and 0.85, 0.79 and 0.74 for achieving age 11 milestones. INTERPRETATION: Children who live with a parent who has depression are more likely to develop depression and not achieve educational milestones, compared to children who live with a parent who has a history of depression (but no active depression in child's lifetime) and compared to those with no depression. This finding suggests that working closely with families where depression (particularly chronic depression) is present in either parent and treating parental depression to remission is likely to have long-term benefits for children's mental health and educational attainment.", "pub_date": "2021-11-17", "authors": ["Sinead Brophy", "Charlotte Todd", "Muhammad A Rahman", "Natasha Kennedy", "Frances Rice"], "journal": "PloS one", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0258966", "source": "pubmed"}

DDR1 has been widely studied in several types of cancers, in atherosclerosis and fibrosis, but also in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review focuses on the role of DDR1 in chronic nephropathies and on the effect of its deletion in the pathological processes involved in renal disease progression. DDR1 was shown to be de novo expressed in several models of experimental CKD. Its genetic or pharmaco-genetic inhibition led to the preservation of renal structure and function, and to decreased inflammatory influx and fibrosis. Furthermore, delayed pharmaco-genetic inhibition of DDR1 led to significant protection in models of renal disease. These results demonstrate the involvement of DDR1 in inflammatory and fibrotic processes occurring during CKD and the beneficial effect of its inhibition. Thus, DDR1 could be an interesting therapeutic target to treat renal pathologies.", "pub_date": "2017-07-26", "authors": ["Aude Dorison", "Jean-Claude Dussaule", "Christos Chatziantoniou"], "journal": "Nephron", "doi": "10.1159/000479119", "source": "pubmed"}

These highly aggressive malignancies have a poor prognosis and no specific therapy. The presence of effector immune cells in the damaged brain and vitreous suggests that treatment with anti-human CD20 (hCD20) monoclonal antibodies might be effective. We developed murine models of PCL and PIOL to assess the intracerebral and intraocular antitumor effect of ublituximab, a promising glycoengineered anti-hCD20 mAb with a high affinity for FcγRIIIa (CD16) receptors. METHODS: The murine lymphoma B-cell line A20.IIA-GFP-hCD20 (H-2(d)) was injected into the right cerebral striatum or the vitreous of immunocompetent adult BALB/c mice (H-2(d)). Four to 7 days later, ublituximab was injected intracerebrally or intravitreously into the tumor site. Rituximab was the reference compound. Survival was monitored for injected mice; histopathological and flow cytometric analyses were performed to study tumor growth and T-cell infiltration. RESULTS: Single doses of ublituximab, injected intracerebrally or intravitreously, had a marked antitumor effect, more pronounced than that obtained with the same dose of rituximab in these conditions. The reduction in tumor cells was correlated with an increased proportion of CD8(+) T cells. This efficacy was observed only against lymphoma B cells expressing hCD20.

No immunological response was observed clinically under the applied FUS level in humans; however, selecting a higher level in animals resulted in prolonged immunostimulation, as confirmed preclinically by the recruitment of lymphocytes into the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a rat glioma model. Our findings provide preliminary evidence of FUS-induced immune modulation as an additional therapeutic benefit by converting the immunosuppressive TME into an immunostimulatory TME via a higher but safe FUS dosage.", "pub_date": "2021-02-05", "authors": ["Ko-Ting Chen", "Wen-Yen Chai", "Ya-Jui Lin", "Chia-Jung Lin", "Pin-Yuan Chen", "Hong-Chieh Tsai", "Chiung-Yin Huang", "John S Kuo", "Hao-Li Liu", "Kuo-Chen Wei"], "journal": "Science advances", "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.abd0772", "source": "pubmed"}

Recent epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that exposure to environmental agents, including a number of agricultural chemicals, may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Animal models are important tools in experimental medical science for studying the pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention strategies of human diseases. Since many human disorders do not arise spontaneously in animals, characteristic functional changes have to be mimicked by neurotoxic agents. Recently, agricultural chemicals, when administrated systemically, have been shown to reproduce specific features of PD in rodents, thus opening new routes for the development of animal models for this disorder. In addition to a brief historical overview of the toxin-induced PD models, this study provides a detailed description of exiting models in which Parkinsonism is initiated via the exposure of animals to such agricultural chemicals as rotenone, paraquat, and maneb.

Dedicated groups of experts and funding are focusing on achieving a functional cure to eradicate this disease by 2030. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: With more than 40 molecules available or under investigation as new treatments for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, none of them is curative so far. Available treatments are effective in suppressing HBV replication and in decreasing the risk of developing cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death, but do not eliminate the virus, and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma remains. Nucleoside/nucleotide analogs are recommended as first-line therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B infection to inhibit viral replication and lower the HBV DNA values, but long-term therapy is usually needed to maintain suppression. Cessation of the therapy in accordance with clinical guidelines can result in virological and clinical relapse. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov , and gray literature sources were searched for articles discussing HBV management and new therapies. RESULTS: With current nucleoside/nucleotide analog therapies, fewer than 5% of patients lose hepatitis B surface antigen after 12 months, which underscores the need for new drugs that can achieve a functional cure. New therapies are being developed, including small interfering RNAs. Bepirovirsen, a modified antisense oligonucleotide, shows promising results and a good safety profile, but requires further exploration in larger number of patients to determine whether a functional cure is possible. CONCLUSIONS: Eradication of HBV infection with currently available therapies is not yet possible. Experts are developing innovative treatments, such as bepirovirsen, to achieve functional cure for this disease and to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.", "pub_date": "2024-03-27", "authors": ["Cella Danielescu", "Monica State", "Radu Bogdan Mateescu"], "journal": "American journal of therapeutics", "doi": "10.1097/MJT.0000000000001651", "source": "pubmed"}

Sepsis organ dysfunction scores-pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) (Schlapbach, Matics, Shime), quickSOFA, quickSOFA-L, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD)-2, quickPELOD-2, and Pediatric Multiple Organ Dysfunction score-were calculated during the first 24 hours of admission (day 1) and their performance compared with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and severe sepsis-International Consensus Conference on Pediatric Sepsis(ICCPS)-derived criteria-using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Primary outcome was PICU mortality. Secondary outcomes were: a composite of death and new disability (ie, change from baseline Pediatric Overall Performance Category score ≥1); prolonged PICU length of stay (>5 d); prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) (>3 d). RESULTS: Among 60 patients with sepsis, 4 (6.7%) died, 7 (11.7%) developed new disability, 26 (43.3%) experienced prolonged length of stay, and 21 (35%) prolonged invasive MV. The prognostic ability in mortality discrimination was significantly higher for organ dysfunction scores, with PELOD-2 showing the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.924; 95% confidence interval, 0.837-1.000), significantly better than SIRS 3 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P = 0.009), SIRS 4 criteria (0.924 vs 0.509, P < 0.001), and severe sepsis (0.924 vs 0.527, P < 0.001).

We also show that DGSEA is more predictive than GSEA of the metabolic state of cancer cell lines, including lactate secretion and intracellular concentrations of lactate and AMP. Finally, we demonstrate the application of DGSEA to generate hypotheses about differential metabolic pathway activity in cellular senescence.

An early, accurate mortality-risk tool may aid in trial design for novel therapies. We assessed the performance of two generic scores that assign mortality risk within 1 hr of ICU admission: the Preintensive Care Pediatric Risk of Mortality (Pre-ICU PRISM) and Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM). DESIGN: Prospective, observational study over 21 months. SETTING: Two tertiary pediatric ICUs accepting referrals from southeast England. PATIENTS: Patients were 165 consecutive children with meningococcal disease. Ages ranged from 0.1 to 17 yrs (median 2.3 yrs). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PIM demonstrated greater sensibility, with complete data collected in 93% of cases, compared with 35% for the pre-ICU PRISM. Both scores discriminated well. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.00) for PIM and 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.88-0.98) for Pre-ICU PRISM; this did not change when applied to the subgroup of patients with complete data. Both scores calibrated poorly, overestimating mortality in the medium-risk strata (and also in the high-risk stratum in the case of Pre-ICU PRISM). When used as a stratification tool for a hypothetical trial (60% reduction in mortality, 80% power), the scores allowed for a reduction in study size by 50% (PIM) and 43% (pre-ICU PRISM). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-ICU PRISM and PIM both discriminate well but calibrate poorly when applied to a cohort of children with meningococcal sepsis.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that occupational exposure to pesticides (e.g., dieldrin, paraquat, rotenone, maneb, and ziram) is associated with a higher risk of developing PD in susceptible populations. Within dopaminergic neurons, environmental chemicals can have an array of adverse effects resulting in cell death, such as aberrant redox cycling and oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, unfolded protein response, ubiquitin-proteome system dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and metabolic disruption. More recently, our understanding of how pesticides affect cells of the central nervous system has been strengthened by computational biology. New insight has been gained about transcriptional and proteomic networks, and the metabolic pathways perturbed by pesticides. These networks and cell signaling pathways constitute potential therapeutic targets for intervention to slow or mitigate neurodegenerative diseases. Here we review the epidemiological evidence that supports a role for specific pesticides in the etiology of PD and identify molecular profiles amongst these pesticides that may contribute to the disease. Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, these transcripts were compared to those regulated by the PD-associated neurotoxicant MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine). While many transcripts are already established as those related to PD (alpha-synuclein, caspases, leucine rich repeat kinase 2, and parkin2), lesser studied targets have emerged as \"pesticide/PD-associated transcripts\" [e.g., phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class C (Pigc), allograft inflammatory factor 1 (Aif1), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3, and DNA damage inducible transcript 4]. We also compared pesticide-regulated genes to a recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in PD which revealed new genetic mutant alleles; the pesticides under review regulated the expression of many of these genes (e.g., ELOVL fatty acid elongase 7, ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a1, and bridging integrator 3). The significance is that these proteins may contribute to pesticide-related increases in PD risk.

Only PQ + MB reduced tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and DA transporter immunoreactivity and did so in dorsal striatum but not nucleus accumbens.

METHODS: A total of 20 neonates with sepsis who were hospitalized in the Department of Neonatology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, from January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2020 were enrolled as the sepsis group. Venous blood samples were collected on days 1, 4, and 7 after admission. Ten healthy neonates who underwent physical examination during the same period were enrolled as the control group. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for the metabonomic analysis of serum samples to investigate the change in metabolomics in neonates with sepsis at different time points. RESULTS: On day 1 after admission, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between the sepsis and control groups were mainly involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid skeleton. For the sepsis group, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 4 after admission were mainly involved in pyruvate metabolism, and those between days 4 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in the metabolism of cysteine and methionine. The differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in ascorbic acid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic mechanism of serum metabolites varies at different stages in neonates with sepsis and is mainly associated with terpenoid skeleton biosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism, cysteine/methionine metabolism, and ascorbic acid metabolism.

It is a long half-life derivative of glycine-proline-glutamate, the tripeptide normally excided from Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 upon degradation. Due to containing glutamate and glycine in its structure, trofinetide is thought to act through NMDA receptor modulation, thus providing a normalization of neuronal activity and survival. Trofinetide was tested in a series of short and long-term trials, showing good efficacy at improving scores on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale and Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire, with specific effect only on some subscales, ie General Mood subscale and Repetitive Face Movement subscale. No effects were documented on other subscales or on epilepsy, heart and bone -related symptoms. The main adverse effects of trofinetide, severe enough to determine discontinuation, include diarrhea, vomiting, and consequent weight loss. These may be scarcely avoidable, given the need to assume a very large amount of trofinetide per day. Other inherent limitations of use possibly regard the limited duration of drug supplies, as one bottle may last three days only, depending on weight, and the relatively high cost per bottle. Trofinetide has no direct competitors: single symptoms of the Rett Syndrome, for instance, seizures or aggressive behaviors, are currently treated with drugs that have been developed for patients without the Rett Syndrome. This leads to suboptimal efficacy and increased risk of adverse effects. The place in therapy of trofinetide is yet to be determined, based on the results of clinical trials, on its practical usability, and on the windows of opportunity for intervention. Moreover, trofinetide may be curative if given early enough during brain development, or merely symptomatic if given to young adults, and no data exist on this aspect. The place in therapy of trofinetide will require reassessment after competing treatments enter the market.", "pub_date": "2024-11-06", "authors": ["Laura Camillo", "Marco Pozzi", "Pia Bernardo", "Simone Pisano", "Maria Nobile"], "journal": "Drug design, development and therapy", "doi": "10.2147/DDDT.S383133", "source": "pubmed"}

METHODS: We assessed lifetime use of pesticides selected by mechanism in a case-control study nested in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS). PD was diagnosed by movement disorders specialists. Controls were a stratified random sample of all AHS participants frequency-matched to cases by age, sex, and state at approximately three controls:one case.

Family Talk is one of the better known interventions designed to prevent the intergenerational transmission of mental illness. However, its evidence base is small, with few robust independent randomised controlled trials, and no associated process or cost evaluations. The PRIMERA (Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children) research programme involves a mixed method evaluation of Family Talk which is being delivered in mental health settings in Ireland to improve child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness. METHODS: The study comprises a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT), with nested economic and process evaluations, to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness and implementation mechanisms of Family Talk compared to usual services. The study is being conducted in 15 adult and child mental health settings in Ireland. Families with a parent with mental illness, and children aged 5-18 years (n = 144 families) will be randomised to either the 7-session Family Talk programme (n = 96) or to standard care (n = 48) using a 2:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcomes are child psychosocial functioning and family functioning. Secondary outcomes are as follows: understanding and experience of parental mental illness, parental mental health, child and parental resilience, partner wellbeing and service utilisation. Blind assessments will take place at pre-intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Given the prevalence and burden of intergenerational mental illness, it is imperative that prevention through evidence-based interventions becomes a public health priority. The current study will provide an important contribution to the international evidence base for Family Talk whilst also helping to identify key implementation lessons in the scaling up of Family Talk, and other similar interventions, within routine mental health settings.

The primary efficacy end point was the annualized relapse rate and was lower in the ublituximab than the teriflunomide group. EXPERT OPINION: The continuation rates to oral teriflunomide in ULTIMATE were higher than in other trials, possibly because of the supervised double-dummy protocol used with intravenous ublituximab. This may have contributed to the higher efficacy with teriflunomide in this trial than previously reported. Nevertheless, ublituximab was more effective than teriflunomide at reducing the annualized relapse rates and MRI endpoints, but not for no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the ULTIMATE trials did show that ublituximab was superior to teriflunomide in NEDA. Long-term studies of the adverse effects of ublituximab are required.

The purpose of this study was to generate preliminary data on the efficacy of morphomics, as a potential risk stratification tool, in predicting abdominal donor site wound-healing complications in patients undergoing abdominal perforator flap breast reconstruction. Patients and METHODS: In total, 58 consecutive patients undergoing deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap breast reconstruction were evaluated. Using preoperative CT scan data, we quantified patients' body area, visceral and subcutaneous fat, fascia area, and body depth between T12 and L4. Associations between morphomic measures and complication rates were examined using t-tests and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 58 patients, 11 (19%) patients developed a wound dehiscence and 47 (81%) patients healed their abdominal incision without complications. Patients with a dehiscence had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) (34.32 vs. 29.26 kg/m(2), p = 0.014) than patients without a dehiscence. Multiple morphometric measures including higher visceral fat area (p = 0.003) were significant predictors of abdominal donor site wound dehiscence. BMI (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.32; p = 0.017) and visceral fat area (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.42; p = 0.002) were independently significant predictors for wound dehiscence in the entire sample. Only visceral fat area retained its predictive ability in patients with a BMI > 30 kg/m(2). CONCLUSIONS: Morphomic measurements correlate with the likelihood of developing postoperative donor site dehiscence after DIEP flap breast reconstruction.

Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors. METHODS AND DESIGN: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group.

DISCUSSION: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

In a large case-control study of Australian children born during the transition period, those with allergist diagnosed IgE-mediated food allergy were less likely to have received whole-cell vaccine in early infancy than matched population controls (OR: 0.77 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.95)). We hypothesise that a single dose of whole-cell vaccine in early infancy is protective against IgE-mediated food allergy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This adaptive double-blind randomised controlled trial is investigating whether a mixed whole-cell/aP vaccine schedule prevents allergic disease in the first year of life. The primary outcome is IgE-mediated food allergy by 12 months of age. Secondary outcomes include new onset of atopic dermatitis by 6 or 12 months of age; sensitisation to at least one allergen by 12 months of age; seroconversion in anti-pertussis toxin IgG titres after vaccination with aP booster at 18 months of age; and solicited systemic and local adverse events following immunisation with pertussis-containing vaccines.

Individuals diagnosed with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) treated with nilotinib (versus placebo) for 12 months showed reduction of amyloid plaque and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid, and attenuation of hippocampal volume loss. However, the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we explored unbiased next generation whole genome miRNA sequencing from AD patients CSF and miRNAs were matched with their corresponding mRNAs using gene ontology. Changes in CSF miRNAs were confirmed via measurement of CSF DDR1 activity and plasma levels of AD biomarkers. Approximately 1050 miRNAs are detected in the CSF but only 17 miRNAs are specifically altered between baseline and 12-month treatment with nilotinib versus placebo. Treatment with nilotinib significantly reduces collagen and DDR1 gene expression (upregulated in AD brain), in association with inhibition of CSF DDR1. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins and chemokines are reduced along with caspase-3 gene expression. Specific genes that indicate vascular fibrosis, e.g., collagen, Transforming Growth Factors (TGFs) and Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteases (TIMPs) are altered by DDR1 inhibition with nilotinib. Specific changes in vesicular transport, including the neurotransmitters dopamine and acetylcholine, and autophagy genes, including ATGs, indicate facilitation of autophagic flux and cellular trafficking. Inhibition of DDR1 with nilotinib may be a safe and effective adjunct treatment strategy involving an oral drug that enters the CNS and adequately engages its target.

METHODS: We examined the frequency of reported AEs by male research participants compared with AEs reported in prescribing information of approved female hormonal contraceptive methods. Published data from trials of the top five most-used female hormonal contraceptives, supplemented by contemporary contraceptive research, were compared with the frequency of AEs reported in a male injectable hormonal contraceptive trial. RESULTS: We observed similar frequencies of AEs reported by users of male contraceptives compared with those reported by female users. Among quantitatively comparable AEs, compared with men, women reported experiencing higher frequencies of headaches, pelvic pain, and weight gain and similar frequencies of decreased libido. Compared with women, men reported experiencing higher frequencies of acne and mood changes. Men discontinued participation due to AEs at a lower frequency than women. CONCLUSIONS: Female hormonal methods generally have similar frequencies of AEs to those reported in a recent male hormonal contraceptive trial, and male users had lower rates of discontinuation due to AEs. There were fewer serious AEs of the male contraceptive than reported in contemporary female trials which resulted in FDA licensure.

Impulsivity and several psychopathological signs are increased in chronic drug users, but the implications of recreational use are still poorly understood. METHODS: We evaluated impulsivity, sensation-seeking traits, impulsive decision-making, inhibitory control and possible symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychosis in three groups of young university adults: recreational cannabis users (N=20), alcohol binge drinkers (N=22) and non-drug users (N=26). RESULTS: The cannabis and binge drinking groups had increased scores for impulsivity and sensation-seeking traits. Both groups also exhibited increased impulsive decision-making on the two-choice task and the Iowa gambling task; however, only the cannabis group was significantly different from the non-drug group regarding inhibitory control (go/no-go and stop tasks). The cannabis and binge drinking groups did not show differences in the psychopathological symptoms evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations of this population of non-dependent drug users are consistent with the increased impulsivity traits and behaviors that have been described previously in chronic drug abusers. In this study, compared to no drug use, the recreational use of cannabis was associated with a major dysfunction of the different facets of impulsive behaviors. However, alcohol binge drinking was related only to impulsive decision-making. These results suggest that impulsivity traits and behaviors are present not only in chronic drug abusers but also in recreational drug users.

In early trials, promising outcomes have been achieved in some pediatric patients with sarcoma. However, many children do not derive benefit despite significant expression of the targeted tumor antigen. The success of CAR T cell therapy in sarcomas and other solid tumors is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).

The demographic features, risk factors, clinical and laboratory findings in sepsis types were also defined. METHODS: A total of 151 preterm infants with culture-proven neonatal sepsis were enrolled in this prospective study. The infants were classified into three groups with regard to the onset of sepsis: early onset sepsis (EOS), late-onset sepsis (LOS) and very late-onset sepsis (VLOS). A sepsis screen including whole blood count, blood smear, infection markers and cultures was performed before initiating antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: EOS, LOS and VLOS groups consisted of 23, 86 and 42 infants, respectively. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) was the most common organism in all sepsis groups. The main factors associated with EOS included presence of premature rupture of membranes, antibiotic use in pregnancy and choriamnionitis. Previous antibiotic use was the main factor associated with LOS, while low birthweight was the main factor in infants with VLOS. Although mortality rate due to Gram-negative bacteria and fungi was higher, CONS was an important cause of mortality in infants with LOS and VLOS.

Specifically, we discussed randomized clinical trials in subjects with Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis bearing pathogenic gene mutations, and glucocerebrosidase-associated Parkinson's disease. Learning potential lessons to improve future therapeutic approaches is the aim of this review. Two long-term, controlled trials on three anti-β-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab and crenezumab) in subjects carrying Alzheimer's disease-linked mutated genes encoding for amyloid precursor protein or presenilin 1 or presenilin 2 failed to show cognitive or functional benefits. A major trial on tominersen, an antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce the production of the huntingtin protein in subjects with Huntington's disease, was prematurely interrupted because the drug failed to show higher efficacy than placebo and, at highest doses, led to worsened outcomes. A 28-week trial of tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide for superoxide dismutase 1 in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with superoxide dismutase 1 gene mutations failed to show significant beneficial effects but the 1-year open label extension of this study indicated better clinical and functional outcomes in the group with early tofersen therapy. A trial of venglustat, a potent and brain-penetrant glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, in Parkinson's disease subjects with heterozygous glucocerebrosidase gene mutations revealed worsened clinical and cognitive performance of patients on the enzyme inhibitor compared to placebo.

These children are at an increased risk of developing a mental illness themselves (1) as well as a physical illness (2). While research has identified numerous evidence-based family-oriented interventions, little is known about how to implement such interventions effectively and efficiently in clinical practice in Germany. This implementation study (ci-chimps) evaluates three clinical implementation projects with three different implementation interventions for the optimal implementation of the tailored family-oriented preventive and therapeutic interventions in the CHIMPS-NET (children of mentally ill parents-research network) with an implementation model for children of mentally ill parents. METHODS: A two-group randomized controlled multicenter trial will examine changes in family-oriented practice and aspects of implementation at baseline as well as at 12- and 24-months follow-up. The CHIMPS-Network consists of 20 clinical centers. The centers in the intervention group receive the support of all of the three implementation interventions: (1) optimal pathways to care, (2) education and a training program for professionals, and (3) systematic screening for children. The centers in the control group do not receive this specific implementation support. DISCUSSION: While we know that children of mentally ill parents are an important target group to be addressed by preventive and therapeutic interventions, there is often a lack of structured implementation of family-oriented interventions in clinical practice in Germany. Using a randomized controlled multicenter trial design with a large and wide-ranging sample (clinics for adult psychiatry and clinics for child and adolescent psychiatry, university clinics and clinics at the real health care) will provide a robust understanding of implementing family-oriented changes in German clinical practice.

Six years old--the age at which children start the elementary school--is a key age for this screening. At the request of practitioners, a multidisciplinary staff had developed a screening tool: ERTLA6 (Epreuves de repérage des troubles du langage et des apprentissages de l'enfant de 6 ans). The objective was to validate the capacity of ERTLA6 to predict the school performance. A sample of 187 children was randomly constituted among the whole population of last year nursery school children in an area of France (the Académie de Nancy-Metz). Those children, aged from 5 to 6, were screened with ERTLA6 by the school practitioner during a medical visit (score from 0 [the best] to 18 [the worse]). The School outcomes (considered as judgment criteria) were assessed 2 or 3 years later, after two years of elementary school. 148 children had completed their follow-up (the others: 27 moving house, 6 absents the day of evaluation, 2 missing data). Mean age was 5; 10 years. With a threshold > or = 7, ERTLA6 sensibility and specificity were respectively 79% [63-94] and 87% [81-93]; the positive predictive value was 58% [42-74], the negative predictive value was 95% [90-99].

This review is one of a series of reviews that form an update of the Cochrane review, 'Physiotherapy interventions for shoulder pain.' OBJECTIVES: To synthesise available evidence regarding the benefits and harms of manual therapy and exercise, alone or in combination, for the treatment of patients with adhesive capsulitis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP clinical trials registries up to May 2013, unrestricted by language, and reviewed the reference lists of review articles and retrieved trials, to identify potentially relevant trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials, including adults with adhesive capsulitis, and comparing any manual therapy or exercise intervention versus placebo, no intervention, a different type of manual therapy or exercise or any other intervention. Interventions included mobilisation, manipulation and supervised or home exercise, delivered alone or in combination. Trials investigating the primary or adjunct effect of a combination of manual therapy and exercise were the main comparisons of interest. Main outcomes of interest were participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater, overall pain (mean or mean change), function, global assessment of treatment success, active shoulder abduction, quality of life and the number of participants experiencing adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted the data, performed a risk of bias assessment and assessed the quality of the body of evidence for the main outcomes using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included 32 trials (1836 participants). No trial compared a combination of manual therapy and exercise versus placebo or no intervention. Seven trials compared a combination of manual therapy and exercise versus other interventions but were clinically heterogeneous, so opportunities for meta-analysis were limited. The overall impression gained from these trials is that the few outcome differences between interventions that were clinically important were detected only up to seven weeks. Evidence of moderate quality shows that a combination of manual therapy and exercise for six weeks probably results in less improvement at seven weeks but a similar number of adverse events compared with glucocorticoid injection. The mean change in pain with glucocorticoid injection was 58 points on a 100-point scale, and 32 points with manual therapy and exercise (mean difference (MD) 26 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 15 points to 37 points; one RCT, 107 participants), for an absolute difference of 26% (15% to 37%). Mean change in function with glucocorticoid injection was 39 points on a 100-point scale, and 14 points with manual therapy and exercise (MD 25 points, 95% CI 35 points to 15 points; one RCT, 107 participants), for an absolute difference of 25% (15% to 35%). Forty-six per cent (26/56) of participants reported treatment success with manual therapy and exercise compared with 77% (40/52) of participants receiving glucocorticoid injection (risk ratio (RR) 0.6, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.83; one RCT, 108 participants), with an absolute risk difference of 30% (13% to 48%). The number reporting adverse events did not differ between groups: 56% (32/57) reported events with manual therapy and exercise, and 53% (30/57) with glucocorticoid injection (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.49; one RCT, 114 participants), with an absolute risk difference of 4% (-15% to 22%). Group differences in improvement in overall pain and function at six months and 12 months were not clinically important.We are uncertain of the effect of other combinations of manual therapy and exercise, as most evidence is of low quality. Meta-analysis of two trials (86 participants) suggested no clinically important differences between a combination of manual therapy, exercise, and electrotherapy for four weeks and placebo injection compared with glucocorticoid injection alone or placebo injection alone in terms of overall pain, function, active range of motion and quality of life at six weeks, six months and 12 months (though the 95% CI suggested function may be better with glucocorticoid injection at six weeks). The same two trials found that adding a combination of manual therapy, exercise and electrotherapy for four weeks to glucocorticoid injection did not confer clinically important benefits over glucocorticoid injection alone at each time point. Based on one high quality trial (148 participants), following arthrographic joint distension with glucocorticoid and saline, a combination of manual therapy and supervised exercise for six weeks conferred similar effects to those of sham ultrasound in terms of overall pain, function and quality of life at six weeks and at six months, but provided greater patient-reported treatment success and active shoulder abduction at six weeks. One trial (119 participants) found that a combination of manual therapy, exercise, electrotherapy and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for three weeks did not confer clinically important benefits over oral NSAID alone in terms of function and patient-reported treatment success at three weeks.On the basis of 25 clinically heterogeneous trials, we are uncertain of the effect of manual therapy or exercise when not delivered together, or one type of manual therapy or exercise versus another, as most reported differences between groups were not clinically or statistically significant, and the evidence is mostly of low quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The best available data show that a combination of manual therapy and exercise may not be as effective as glucocorticoid injection in the short-term. It is unclear whether a combination of manual therapy, exercise and electrotherapy is an effective adjunct to glucocorticoid injection or oral NSAID. Following arthrographic joint distension with glucocorticoid and saline, manual therapy and exercise may confer effects similar to those of sham ultrasound in terms of overall pain, function and quality of life, but may provide greater patient-reported treatment success and active range of motion. High-quality RCTs are needed to establish the benefits and harms of manual therapy and exercise interventions that reflect actual practice, compared with placebo, no intervention and active interventions with evidence of benefit (e.g. glucocorticoid injection).", "pub_date": "2014-08-26", "authors": ["Matthew J Page", "Sally Green", "Sharon Kramer", "Renea V Johnston", "Brodwen McBain", "Marisa Chau", "Rachelle Buchbinder"], "journal": "The Cochrane database of systematic reviews", "doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD011275", "source": "pubmed"}

Angiopoetin-1 (Ang-1), which promotes vascular integrity, was decreased in blood plasma of human and murine septic newborns. In preclinical models, administration of Ang-1 provided prophylactic protection from septic death. Arachidonic acid metabolism appears to be functionally connected to Ang-1 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a direct role of nitric oxide (NO). Strengthening this intersection via oral administration of arachidonic acid and/or the NO donor L-arginine provided prophylactic as well as therapeutic protection from septic death while also increasing plasma Ang-1 levels among septic newborns.

During last years, there has been a dramatic evolution in several key concepts of immune pathophysiology of MS and in the treatment of this disease. The demonstration of the strong efficacy and good safety profile of selective B-cell-depleting therapies (such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies) has significantly expanded the therapeutic scenario for both relapsing and progressive MS patients with the identification of a new therapeutic target. The key role of B cells in triggering MS disease has been also pointed out, determining a shift from the traditional view of MS activity as largely being 'T-cell mediated' to the notion that MS-related pathological processes involve bi-directional interactions between several immune cell types, including B cells, both in the periphery and in the CNS. This review provides an updated overview of the involvement of B cells in the immune pathophysiology and pathology of MS.

From the epidemiologic literature, there does appear to be a relatively consistent relationship between pesticide exposure and PD. This relationship appears strongest for exposure to herbicides and insecticides, and after long durations of exposure. Toxicologic data suggest that paraquat and rotenone may have neurotoxic actions that potentially play a role in the development of PD, with limited data for other pesticides. However, both the epidemiology and toxicology studies were limited by methodologic weaknesses. Particular issues of current and future interest include multiple exposures (both pesticides and other exogenous toxicants), developmental exposures, and gene-environment interactions.

ORA is therefore a critical method in the interpretation of 'omics data, relating gene lists to biological functions and themes. Although ORA is hugely popular, we and others have noticed two potentially undesired behaviours of some ORA tools. The first one we call the 'background problem', because it involves the software eliminating large numbers of genes from the background list if they are not annotated as belonging to any category. The second one we call the 'false discovery rate problem', because some tools underestimate the true number of parallel tests conducted. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate the impact of these issues on several real RNA-seq datasets and use simulated RNA-seq data to quantify the impact of these problems. We show that the severity of these problems depends on the gene set library, the number of genes in the list, and the degree of noise in the dataset. These problems can be mitigated by changing packages/websites for ORA or by changing to another approach such as functional class scoring.

Although major depression is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, neural correlates of risk for major depression remain poorly understood. This study compares amygdala and nucleus accumbens activation in children and adolescents at high and low risk for major depression under varying attentional and emotional conditions. METHOD: Thirty-nine juveniles, 17 offspring of parents with major depression (high-risk group) and 22 offspring of parents without histories of major depression, anxiety, or psychotic disorders (low-risk group) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. During imaging, subjects viewed faces that varied in intensity of emotional expressions across blocks of trials while attention was unconstrained (passive viewing) and constrained (rate nose width on face, rate subjective fear while viewing face). RESULTS: When attention was unconstrained, high-risk subjects showed greater amygdala and nucleus accumbens activation to fearful faces and lower nucleus accumbens activation to happy faces (small volume corrected for the amygdala and nucleus accumbens). No group differences emerged in amygdala or nucleus accumbens activation during constrained attention. Exploratory analysis showed that constraining attention was associated with greater medial prefrontal cortex activation in the high-risk than in the low-risk group. CONCLUSIONS: Amygdala and nucleus accumbens responses to affective stimuli may reflect vulnerability for major depression.

This etiology of a neurogenic cough has not been previously reported to our knowledge. The proportion of patients with neurogenic cough refractory to all current therapies and suffering with this treatable condition remains to be defined. We introduce the concept of Vagus Associated Neurogenic Cough Occurring due to Unilateral Vascular Encroachment of its Root (VANCOUVER syndrome) and present the salient features of this condition. METHODS: A case review is presented with details of the patient's history, examination, imaging, laryngoscopy, intraoperative findings, and long-term clinical outcome. RESULTS: A 60-year-old man presented with a 15-year history of non-productive cough refractory to antibiotics, and anti-reflux medications. Investigations by an allergist, a cardiologist, a gastroenterologist, two pulmonologists, and an otolaryngologist were negative. MRI demonstrated a vascular compression of his left vagus nerve and microvascular decompression of that nerve resolved his symptoms.

Whether exercise is associated with reductions in CVD risk in patients with breast cancer with an elevated CVD risk phenotype is not known. METHODS: Using a prospective design, women (n = 2,973; mean age, 57 years) diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer participating in two registry-based, regional cohort studies, completed a questionnaire that assessed leisure-time recreational physical activity (metabolic equivalent task [MET]-h/wk). The primary end point was the first occurrence of any of the following: new diagnosis of coronary artery disease, heart failure, valve abnormality, arrhythmia, stroke, or CVD death, occurring after study enrollment. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 8.6 years (range, 0.2 to 14.8 years). In multivariable analysis, the incidence of cardiovascular events decreased across increasing total MET-h/wk categories (Ptrend < .001).

METHODS: Single-center, retrospective review of laboratory records of bacteria and fungi, and their susceptibility profiles, isolated from blood and CSF of infants hospitalized in the neonatal unit at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa, from 1st January 2010 to 31st December 2019. Laboratory data on isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were collected. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Corynebacteria and Bacillus spp. were excluded. Patient-level clinical and laboratory data were not available. RESULTS: There were 8,319 significant isolates, giving an infection rate of 14.3/1000 patient-days. Infection rates increased from 12.0 to 15.7/1000 patient-days (estimated average yearly change 0.6[95%CI, 0.5-0.7];p = <0.001). Gram-negative infection rates increased from 4.3 to 10.8/1000 patient-days (estimated average yearly change 0.7[95%CI,0.6-0.8];p = <0.001). The 2 most commonly isolated Gram-negative organisms were Acinetobacter baumannii (44%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (39%). Carbapenem resistance was seen in 31% of all Gram-negatives and increased over time (estimated average yearly change 4.8%[95%CI,4.2%-5.3%];p<0.001). Gram-positive infection rates decreased (estimated average yearly change -0.1[95%CI,-0.2- -0.05];p = <0.001). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram-positive isolated. Rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus decreased from 91% to 55%(estimated average yearly change -2.8%[95%CI,-3.5%-2%],p< 0.001). Rates of fungal isolates decreased (estimated average yearly change -0.06[95%CI,-0.1 --0.02]);p = 0.007). Candida parapsilosis (52%) and Candida albicans (35%) were the most common fungi isolated. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a marked overall increase in rates of blood and/or CSF infections, with an absolute increase in Gram-negative infections observed, replacing Gram-positive and fungal pathogens. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase Gram-negative isolates are being replaced by carbapenem resistance, with around one third of all significant Gram-negative isolates now carbapenem resistant.

SUMMARY ANSWER: DL was able to detect retrocervical, ovarian, and bladder endometriosis with similar sensitivity and specificity as TVUS-BP, whereas for vaginal and rectosigmoid endometriosis, DL had lower sensitivity and specificity than TVUS-BP. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: TVUS-BP is a non-invasive examination with good accuracy for diagnosing ovarian and deep endometriosis. DL is expensive and can lead to surgical complications. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This prospective study included a total of 120 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for suspected endometriosis with preoperative imaging (TVUS-BP), including a video of the laparoscopic procedure, between March 2017 and September 2019. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Two radiologists performed preoperative TVUS-BP using the same protocol for diagnosing endometriosis. Two surgeons, who were blinded to the results of the preoperative imaging and clinical data, reviewed the surgical videos from the entry of the abdominal cavity until the surgeon finalized a complete and systematic review prior to beginning any dissection (considered as a DL). A data sheet was used by surgeons and radiologists to record the sites and size of disease involvement, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) stage, and the Enzian score. The surgical visualization of endometriosis lesions that were confirmed by histological analysis was the gold standard. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: DL was able to detect retrocervical, ovarian, and bladder endometriosis with similar sensitivity and specificity as TVUS-BP. DL was not able to detect vaginal endometriosis (sensitivity and specificity 0%): this is compared to a sensitivity and specificity of 85.7% and 99.1%, respectively with the utilization of a preoperative TVUS-BP. In addition, DL was notably poor at detecting rectosigmoid endometriosis, with a sensitivity of 3.7-5.6%, and this compares to 96.3% sensitivity with utilization of a preoperative TVUS (P < 0.001). For the ASRM stage, TVUS-BP results were highly correlated with the degree of endometriosis and pouch of Douglas (POD) obliteration (weighted Kappa of 0.867 and 0.985, respectively). For the Enzian score, there was a substantial correlation between TVUSP-BP and DL for compartment A (weighted Kappa = 0.827), compartment B (weighted Kappa = 0.670), and compartment C (weighted kappa = 0.814). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The number of participants included may be a limitation in this study and, as the evaluators were blinded to the physical exam, the DL accuracy could be underestimated. As biopsies of pelvic organs were obtained only if there was a suspicion of endometriosis, the gold standard was not always applicable. This aspect could underestimate the prevalence of lesions and overestimate the sensitivity and the specificity of both the TVUS-BP and the DL. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Preoperative TVUS-BP was accurate in identifying all sites of ovarian and deep endometriosis that were evaluated. It had significantly higher sensitivity than DL in detecting rectosigmoid endometriosis and predicting intraoperative ASRM staging and the Enzian score. These results suggest that TVUS-BP can replace DL for the diagnosis and treatment planning for patients with ovarian and deep endometriosis.

GSEA is especially useful when gene expression changes in a given microarray data set is minimal or moderate. RESULTS: We developed a modified gene set enrichment analysis method based on a parametric statistical analysis model. Compared with GSEA, the parametric analysis of gene set enrichment (PAGE) detected a larger number of significantly altered gene sets and their p-values were lower than the corresponding p-values calculated by GSEA. Because PAGE uses normal distribution for statistical inference, it requires less computation than GSEA, which needs repeated computation of the permutated data set. PAGE was able to detect significantly changed gene sets from microarray data irrespective of different Affymetrix probe level analysis methods or different microarray platforms. Comparison of two aged muscle microarray data sets at gene set level using PAGE revealed common biological themes better than comparison at individual gene level. CONCLUSION: PAGE was statistically more sensitive and required much less computational effort than GSEA, it could identify significantly changed biological themes from microarray data irrespective of analysis methods or microarray platforms, and it was useful in comparison of multiple microarray data sets.

Most patients with MG require induction therapy with high doses of corticosteroids and maintenance with an immunosuppressant. Severe cases and acute worsening require intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis before oral immunosuppressants start having an effect. However, biologics are emerging as important therapeutic tools that promise to provide better corticosteroid sparing effects than standard treatments and can even induce remission. In particular, eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody against complement C5, has been approved by the FDA for refractory MG on the basis of a phase III trial. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that depletes peripheral B cells, has also been effective in many large uncontrolled series, although was not in a small phase III trial. Whether the newer anti-CD20 agents ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, obinutuzumab, ublituximab or inebilizumab will be more effective remains unclear. Belimumab, an antibody against the B cell trophic factor BAFF, was ineffective in phase III trials, and efgartigimod, which depletes antibodies, was effective in a phase II study. Some anti-cytokine agents relevant to MG immunopathogenesis also seem promising. Checkpoint inhibitors can trigger MG in some patients, necessitating early intervention.

Neonates and children are among the most vulnerable population groups of developing sepsis because of their weak immune barrier. Despite major advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections, invasive infections followed by sepsis remain one of the leading causes of childhood mortality. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns of aerobic bacteria among children suspected of having sepsis. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Blood samples were collected from pediatric patients, suspected of having sepsis referred from inpatient facility of department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). Blood samples were inoculated into BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles followed by sub-culture of positive samples in blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests. Antimicrobial resistance pattern of all isolated bacteria was seen by disk diffusion method. MIC of vancomycin by agar dilution method was determined for isolated S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS). The prevalence of pediatric sepsis was 31.82% with highest isolation rate 35.55% among neonates. The isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 62.50% where S. aureus was the most common isolate 32.15% followed by CoNS 30.36%. Out of 21 gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. was the most frequent isolate 7(33.33%), all of which were resistant to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime along with all klebsiella and Acinetobacter isolates. Out of 18 S. aureus isolates, 94.44%, 88.89% and 66.67% were resistant to Azithromycin, Penicillin-G and Ciprofloxacin respectively. The MIC of Vancomycin by agar dilution method was observed <2μg/ml against all isolated S. aureus and CoNS. All the Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to Linezolid and Vancomycin.

This Commentary provides an overview of the psychiatric effects of plant-based and synthetic cannabinoids, differentiating acute effects from effects associated with persistent use. Cannabinoids produce multiphasic and dose-dependent effects on anxiety, mood, and perception, in addition to impairing cognition and psychomotor function. Generally, in healthy individuals, the acute negative psychiatric effects of cannabinoids are rated as milder in severity compared with those in individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. With chronic exposure to cannabinoids, the probability of developing tolerance and dependence can increase. A problematic pattern of cannabis use can lead to clinically significant impairment and distress. Cessation of cannabis use in individuals who are tolerant and dependent can lead to a withdrawal syndrome. Studies report long-term cannabis exposure has been linked to psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, psychotic and mood disorders. Limitations to the existing evidence notwithstanding, the plausibility of a causal relationship between cannabinoid exposure and persistent negative psychiatric outcomes, and the potential for long-term brain changes by regular exposure, especially for adolescents, are sufficient to warrant discussions with clinicians and the public.

Studying all age groups is more suitable to assess the burden of single pathogens and their clinical relevance. METHODS: This is a retrospective regional study involving paediatric departments and NICUs in Emilia-Romagna (Italy). Regional laboratory databases were searched from 2009 to 2012. Records of infants (aged 4 to 90 days) with a positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture were retrospectively reviewed and analysed according to acquisition mode (whether hospital- or community-acquired). RESULTS: During the study period, there were 146,682 live births (LBs), with 296 patients experiencing 331 episodes of LOS (incidence rate: 2.3/1000 LBs). Brain lesions upon discharge from the hospital were found in 12.3% (40/296) of cases, with death occurring in 7.1% (23/296; 0.14/1000 LBs). With respect to full-term neonates, extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight neonates had very high risk of LOS and related mortality (> 100- and > 800-fold higher respectively). Hospital-acquired LOS (n = 209) was significantly associated with very low birth weight, extremely preterm birth, pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, and death (p< 0.01). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, catecholamine support (OR = 3.2), central venous line before LOS (OR = 14.9), and meningitis (OR = 44.7) were associated with brain lesions or death in hospital-acquired LOS (area under the ROC curve 0.81, H-L p = 0.41). Commonly identified pathogens included coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS n = 71, 21.4%), Escherichia coli (n = 50, 15.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 41, 12.4%) and Enterobacteriaceae (n = 41, 12.4%).

METHODS: Multicenter cohort study including children <16 years admitted with sepsis or septic shock to ICUs in Australia and New Zealand in the period 2012-2015. We assessed septic shock criteria at ICU admission to define sepsis severity, using 30-day mortality as outcome. Through multivariable logistic regression, a pediatric sepsis score was derived using variables available within 60 min of ICU admission. RESULTS: Of 42,523 pediatric admissions, 4403 children were admitted with invasive infection, including 1697 diagnosed as having sepsis/septic shock on admission. Mortality was 8.5% (144/1697) and 50.7% of deaths occurred within 48 h of admission. The presence of septic shock as defined by the 2005 consensus was sensitive but not specific in predicting mortality (AUC = 0.69; 95% CI 0.65-0.72). Combinations of hypotension, vasopressor therapy, and lactate >2 mmol/l discriminated poorly (AUC <0.60). Multivariate models showed that oxygenation markers, ventilatory support, hypotension, cardiac arrest, serum lactate, pupil responsiveness, and immunosuppression were the best-performing predictors (0.843; 0.811-0.875). We derived a pediatric sepsis score (0.817; 0.779-0.855), and every one-point increase was associated with a 28.5% (23.8-33.2%) increase in the odds of death.

This process often involves the application of social paradigms - however, these often only include momentary affective depictions rather than unfolding interactions. This constitutes a limitation in our capacity to probe core symptoms, and leaves potential findings uncovered which could help those who are in close relationships with affected individuals. Here, we deployed a novel task in which subjects interact with four unknown virtual partners in a turn-taking paradigm akin to a dance, and report on their experience with each. The virtual partners embody four combinations of low/high expressivity of positive/negative mood. Higher scores on our symptomatic measures of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were all linked to a general negative appraisal of all the interpersonal experiences. Moreover, the negative appraisal of the partner who displayed a high negative/low positive mood was tied with attachment anxiety and BPD symptoms. The extent to which subjects felt responsible for causing partners' distress was most strongly linked to attachment anxiety. Finally, we provide a fully-fledged exploration of move-by-move action latencies and click distances from partners. This analysis underscored slower movement initiation from anxiously attached individuals throughout all virtual interactions. In summary, we describe a novel paradigm for second-person neuroscience, which allowed both the replication of established results and the capture of new behavioural signatures associated with attachment anxiety, and discuss its limitations.", "pub_date": "2024-04-17", "authors": ["Federico Mancinelli", "Tobias Nolte", "Julia Griem", "Terry Lohrenz", "Janet Feigenbaum", "Brooks King-Casas", "P Read Montague", "Peter Fonagy", "Christoph Mathys"], "journal": "Journal of psychiatric research", "doi": "10.1016/j.jpsychires.2024.03.046", "source": "pubmed"}

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of neonatal treatment with resveratrol on postural development, motor function, oxidative balance, and mitochondrial biogenesis in the brain of rats submitted to a cerebral palsy model. Neonatal treatment with resveratrol attenuated deficits in somatic growth, postural development, and muscle strength in rats submitted to cerebral palsy. Related to oxidative balance, resveratrol in cerebral palsy decreased the levels of MDA and carbonyls. Related to mitochondrial biogenesis, was observed in animals with cerebral palsy treated with resveratrol, an increase in mRNA levels of TFAM, in association with the increase of citrate synthase activity.

Given declining PICU mortality, we assessed the ability of the Pediatric Risk of Mortality-III (PRISM) and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD) scores to predict morbidity outcomes. METHODS: Among 359 survivors <18 years in the Life After Pediatric Sepsis Evaluation multicenter prospective cohort study, we assessed functional morbidity at hospital discharge (Functional Status Scale increase ≥3 points from baseline) and health-related quality of life (HRQL; Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory or Functional Status II-R) deterioration >25% from baseline at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-admission. We determined discrimination of admission PRISM and admission, maximum, and cumulative 28-day PELOD with functional and HRQL morbidity at each timepoint. RESULTS: Cumulative PELOD provided the best discrimination of discharge functional morbidity (area under the receive operating characteristics curve [AUROC] 0.81, 95% CI 0.76-0.87) and 3-month HRQL deterioration (AUROC 0.71, 95% CI 0.61-0.81). Prediction was inferior for admission PRISM and PELOD and for 6- and 12-month HRQL assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Illness severity scores have a good prediction of early functional morbidity but a more limited ability to predict longer-term HRQL. Identification of factors beyond illness severity that contribute to HRQL outcomes may offer opportunities for intervention to improve outcomes. IMPACT: Illness severity scores are commonly used for mortality prediction and risk stratification in pediatric critical care research, quality improvement, and resource allocation algorithms. Prediction of morbidity rather than mortality may be beneficial given declining pediatric intensive care unit mortality. The PRISM and PELOD scores have moderate to good ability to predict new functional morbidity at hospital discharge following pediatric septic shock but limited ability to predict health-related quality of life outcomes in the year following PICU admission.

DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). PATIENTS: Ninety-four children. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Leucocyte count, PCT and CRP were measured when considered necessary during the PICU stay. Patients were classified, when PCT and CRP were measured, into one of six categories (negative, SIRS, localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock) according to the definitions of the American College of Chest Physicians /Society of Critical Care Medicine. A total of 359 patient day episodes were obtained. Leucocyte count did not differ across the six diagnostic classes considered. Median plasma PCT concentrations were 0.17, 0.43, 0.79, 1.80, 15.40 and 19.13 ng/ml in negative, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock groups, respectively, whereas median plasma CRP concentrations were 1.35, 3.80, 6.45, 5.70, 7.60 and 16.2 mg/dl, respectively. The area under the ROC curve for the diagnosis of septic patients was 0.532 for leucocyte count (95% CI, 0.462-0.602), 0.750 for CRP (95% CI, 0.699-0.802) and 0.912 for PCT (95% CI, 0.882-0.943). We obtained four groups using CRP values and five groups using PCT values that classified a significant percentage of patients according to the severity of the different SIRS groups.

Questions concerning the efficacy and safety of antidepressant medications in the treatment of depression in children and adolescents, led us to integrate the direct and indirect evidence using network meta-analysis to create hierarchies of these drugs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Seven databases with PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, LiLACS and PsycINFO will be searched from 1966 to December 2013 (updated to May, 2015). There are no restrictions on language or type of publication. Randomised clinical trials assessing first-generation and newer-generation antidepressant medications against active comparator or placebo as acute treatment for depressive disorders in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) will be included. The primary outcome for efficacy will be mean improvement in depressive symptoms, as measured by the mean change score of a depression rating scale from baseline to post-treatment. The tolerability of treatment will be defined as side effect discontinuation, as defined by the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the trial. We will also assess the secondary outcome for efficacy (response rate), acceptability (all-cause discontinuation) and suicide-related outcomes. We will perform the Bayesian network meta-analyses for all relative outcome measures. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. DISSEMINATION: The network meta-analysis will provide useful information on antidepressant treatment for child and adolescent depression.

The aim of this narrative review is to delineate the wide array of pathways that may underpin the incapacitating fatigue occurring in systemic and neuro-inflammatory disorders. A wide array of immune, inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS), bioenergetic, and neurophysiological abnormalities are involved in the etiopathology of these disease states and may underpin the incapacitating fatigue that accompanies these disorders. This range of abnormalities comprises: increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α and interferon (IFN) α; O&NS-induced muscle fatigue; activation of the Toll-Like Receptor Cycle through pathogen-associated (PAMPs) and damage-associated (DAMPs) molecular patterns, including heat shock proteins; altered glutaminergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission; mitochondrial dysfunctions; and O&NS-induced defects in the sodium-potassium pump. Fatigue is also associated with altered activities in specific brain regions and muscle pathology, such as reductions in maximum voluntary muscle force, downregulation of the mitochondrial biogenesis master gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, a shift to glycolysis and buildup of toxic metabolites within myocytes. As such, both mental and physical fatigue, which frequently accompany immune-inflammatory and neuro-inflammatory disorders, are the consequence of interactions between multiple systemic and central pathways.", "pub_date": "2015-01-20", "authors": ["Gerwyn Morris", "Michael Berk", "Piotr Galecki", "Ken Walder", "Michael Maes"], "journal": "Molecular neurobiology", "doi": "10.1007/s12035-015-9090-9", "source": "pubmed"}

Overall, this represents a 13.6% increase since 2004, partly due to inclusion of 28 417 cycles from Turkey. European data on intrauterine insemination using husband/partner's semen (IUI-H) and donor semen (IUI-D) were reported from 21 countries and included 128 908 IUI-H and 20 568 IUI-D cycles. RESULTS: In 16 countries where all clinics reported to the IVF register, 1115 cycles were performed per million inhabitants. For IVF, the clinical pregnancy rates per aspiration and per transfer were 26.9% and 30.3%, respectively. For ICSI, the corresponding rates were 28.5% and 30.9%. After IUI-H, the clinical pregnancy rate was 12.6% per insemination in women <40. After IVF and ICSI, the distribution of transfer of one, two, three and four or more embryos was 20.0%, 56.1%, 21.5% and 2.3%, respectively. Huge differences exist between countries.

Its accurate and timely diagnosis is hindered by vague symptoms and the urgent necessity for early antibiotic intervention. The gold standard for diagnosing the condition is the identification of a pathogenic organism from normally sterile sites via laboratory testing. However, this method is resource-intensive and cannot be conducted continuously. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to predict the onset of late-onset sepsis (LOS) with good diagnostic value as early as possible using non-invasive biosignal measurements from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) monitors. METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study, we developed a multimodal machine learning algorithm based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure that uses the power spectral density (PSD) of recorded biosignals to predict the onset of LOS. This approach aimed to discern LOS-related pathogenic spectral signatures without labor-intensive manual artifact removal. RESULTS: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic score of 0.810 (95 % CI 0.698-0.922) on the validation dataset. With an optimal operating point, LOS detection had 83 % sensitivity and 73 % specificity. The median early detection was 44 h before clinical suspicion. The results highlighted the additive importance of electrocardiogram and respiratory impedance (RESP) signals in improving predictive accuracy. According to a more detailed analysis, the predictive power arose from the morphology of the electrocardiogram's R-wave and sudden changes in the RESP signal. CONCLUSION: Raw biosignals from NICU monitors, in conjunction with PSD transformation, as input to the CNN, can provide state-of-the-art prediction performance for LOS without the need for artifact removal. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to highlight the independent and additive predictive potential of electrocardiogram R-wave morphology and concurrent, sudden changes in the RESP waveform in predicting the onset of LOS using non-invasive biosignals.", "pub_date": "2024-02-04", "authors": ["Antti Kallonen", "Milla Juutinen", "Alpo Värri", "Guy Carrault", "Patrick Pladys", "Alain Beuchée"], "journal": "International journal of medical informatics", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2024.105366", "source": "pubmed"}

Disorders of neuromuscular junction transmission and metabolic diseases cause muscle fatigability, which is characterised by failure to sustain the force of muscle contraction (peripheral fatigue). Fatigue is also seen in diseases that affect the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems (central fatigue). Enhanced perception of effort and limited endurance of sustained physical and mental activities are the main characteristics of central fatigue. Metabolic and structural lesions that disrupt the usual process of activation in pathways interconnecting the basal ganglia, thalamus, limbic system, and higher cortical centre are implicated in the pathophysiological process of central fatigue. A state of pre-existing relative hypocortisolaemia might sensitise the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to development of persistent central fatigue after stress.

Inhibitory activity of cannabinoids (CB) at the CB1 and CB2 receptors centrally and peripherally mediate the therapeutic effects that are wielded for palliation of pain, anxiety, inflammation, and nausea in indicated conditions. Cannabis dependence is also associated with anxiety; however, the direction of causality is unknown, such as whether anxiety disorders lead to cannabis use, or whether cannabis contributes to the development of anxiety disorder. The evidence hints that both may have validity. Here we present a case of cannabis-associated panic attacks following 10 years of chronic cannabis dependence in an individual with no prior psychiatric history. The patient is a 32-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented complaining of five-minute episodes of palpitations, dyspnea, upper extremity paresthesia, subjective tachycardia, and cold diaphoresis occurring in a variety of circumstances for the past two years. His social history was significant for 10 years of smoking marijuana multiple times daily, which he had quit over two years ago. The patient denied past psychiatric history or known anxiety problems. Symptoms were unrelated to activity and only relieved with deep breathing. The episodes were not associated with chest pain, syncope, headache, or emotional triggers. The patient had no family history of cardiac disease or sudden death. The episodes were refractory to the elimination of caffeine, alcohol, or other sugary beverages. The patient had already stopped smoking marijuana when the episodes began. Due to the unpredictable nature of the episodes, the patient reported a growing fear of being in public. On laboratory workup, metabolic and blood panels were within normal limits, as well as thyroid studies. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, and continuous cardiac monitoring revealed no arrhythmias or abnormalities despite the patient indicating multiple triggered events within the duration of monitoring. Echocardiography also showed no abnormalities. With organic cardiac causes of the subjective palpitation episodes ruled out, a psychogenic etiology of the episodes was presumed, and the patient was referred to behavioral health services. In conclusion, cannabis-induced anxiety or panic disorders should be considered in patients with no prior psychiatric history presenting with anxiety-like attacks following a period of cannabis dependence or current use. These patients should be advised to cease cannabis use and referred to behavioral medicine.", "pub_date": "2023-01-25", "authors": ["Grace A Johnson", "Lucy Guerra", "Asa Oxner"], "journal": "Cureus", "doi": "10.7759/cureus.34197", "source": "pubmed"}

Prevalence and pathogen distribution of sepsis in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) vary with time and geographic location. Such information serves as a guide for selection of empirical antibiotics coverage. METHODS: This is a case series study performed by retrospective chart review of VLBW infants (birth body weight, BBW, <1500 g) in a medical center during a 5-year period from January 2005 to December 2009. Episodes of positive blood cultures, pathogen distribution and related clinical manifestations were described. RESULTS: A total of 158 episodes of sepsis were identified from 1042 VLBW infants. Sepsis rate was 152 per 1000 live births. The vast majority of infections (60.7%) were caused by Gram-positive organisms [G(+)], and overall Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (52.5%) were the most common pathogen identified. Prevalence for early-onset sepsis (EOS) was 1% and for late-onset sepsis (LOS) was 14.2%. Infants with EOS had a much higher case fatality rate than LOS (40% vs. 4.7%). Escherichia coli (40%) were the leading pathogen of EOS while CoNS (54.7%) was the leading pathogens of LOS. Overall, apnea and/or bradycardia and/or cyanosis (65.8%), poor activity (48.7%), and increased respiratory effort (43.0%) were the most common presenting features of sepsis.

Physiologic and laboratory variables used to define the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and organ dysfunction require modification for the developmental stages of children. An international panel of 20 experts in sepsis and clinical research from five countries (Canada, France, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States) was convened to modify the published adult consensus definitions of infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction for children. DESIGN: Consensus conference. METHODS: This document describes the issues surrounding consensus on four major questions addressed at the meeting: a) How should the pediatric age groups affected by sepsis be delineated? b) What are the specific definitions of pediatric SIRS, infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock? c) What are the specific definitions of pediatric organ failure and the validity of pediatric organ failure scores? d) What are the appropriate study populations and study end points required to successfully conduct clinical trials in pediatric sepsis? Five subgroups first met separately and then together to evaluate the following areas: signs and symptoms of sepsis, cell markers, cytokines, microbiological data, and coagulation variables. All conference participants approved the final draft of the proceedings of the meeting. RESULTS: Conference attendees modified the current criteria used to define SIRS and sepsis in adults to incorporate pediatric physiologic variables appropriate for the following subcategories of children: newborn, neonate, infant, child, and adolescent. In addition, the SIRS definition was modified so that either criteria for fever or white blood count had to be met. We also defined various organ dysfunction categories, severe sepsis, and septic shock specifically for children. Although no firm conclusion was made regarding a single appropriate study end point, a novel nonmortality end point, organ failure-free days, was considered optimal for pediatric clinical trials given the relatively low incidence of mortality in pediatric sepsis compared with adult populations. CONCLUSION: We modified the adult SIRS criteria for children. In addition, we revised definitions of severe sepsis and septic shock for the pediatric population.

Clinical examination, transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are significant preoperative non-invasive diagnosis procedures for the accurate assessment of endometriosis. Although TVS is used as the primary line for diagnosis, MRI is commonly utilized to achieve a better anatomical overview of the entire pelvic organs. The aim of this systematic review article is to thoroughly summarize the research on various endometriosis diagnosis methods that are less invasive. (2) Methods: To find relevant studies, we examined electronic databases, such as MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar, choosing 70 papers as references. (3) Results: The findings indicate that various approaches can contribute to diagnosis in different ways, depending on the type of endometriosis. For patients suspected of having deep pelvic endometriosis, transvaginal sonography should be the first line of diagnosis. Endometriosis cysts are better diagnosed with TVS, whereas torus, uterosacral ligaments, intestine, and bladder endometriosis lesions are best diagnosed using MRI. When it comes to detecting intestine or rectal nodules, as well as rectovaginal septum nodules, MRI should be the imaging tool of choice. (4) Conclusions: When diagnosing DE (deep infiltrative endometriosis), the examiner's experience is the most important criterion to consider. In the diagnosis of endometriosis, expert-guided TVS is more accurate than routine pelvic ultrasound, especially in the deep infiltrative form.

Hormonal male contraceptive methods have undergone extensive clinical trials in healthy men and shown to be efficacious, reversible and appear to be well tolerated. RECENT FINDINGS: The success rate of male hormonal contraception using injectable testosterone alone is high and comparable to methods for women. Addition of progestins to androgens improved the rate of suppression of spermatogenesis. Supported by government or nongovernment organizations, current studies aim to find the best combination of testosterone and progestins for effective spermatogenesis suppression and to explore other delivery methods for these hormones. Translation of these advances to widespread use in the developed world will need the manufacturing and marketing skills of the pharmaceutical industry. Availability of male contraceptives to the developing world may require commitments of governmental and nongovernmental agencies. In a time when imbalance of basic resources and population needs are obvious, this may prove to be a very wise investment. SUMMARY: Male hormonal contraception is efficacious, reversible and well tolerated for the target population of younger men in stable relationships. Suppression of spermatogenesis is achieved with a combination of an androgen and a progestin. Partnership with industry will accelerate the marketing of a male hormonal contraceptive. Research is ongoing on selective androgen and progesterone receptor modulators that suppress spermatogenesis, minimize potential adverse events while retaining the androgenic and gonadotropin suppressive actions.", "pub_date": "2010-11-01", "authors": ["Christina Wang", "Ronald S Swerdloff"], "journal": "Current opinion in urology", "doi": "10.1097/MOU.0b013e32833f1b4a", "source": "pubmed"}

Despite a variety of female contraceptive options, male contraceptive options are limited to the condom and vasectomy. Condoms have high failure rates and surgical vasectomy is not reliably reversible. There is a global need and desire for novel male contraceptive methods. Hormonal methods have progressed the furthest in clinical development and androgen plus progestin formulations hold promise as a marketable, reversible male contraceptive over the next decade. Investigators have tested androgen plus progestin approaches using oral, transdermal, subdermal, and injectable drug formulations and demonstrated the short-term safety and reversibility of hormonal male contraception. The most commonly reported side effects associated with hormonal male contraception include weight gain, acne, slight suppression of serum high-density cholesterol, mood changes, and changes in libido. Efficacy trials of hormonal male contraceptives have demonstrated contraceptive efficacy rates greater than that of condoms. Although there has been less progression in the development of nonhormonal male contraceptives, potentially reversible vaso-occlusive methods are currently in clinical trials in some countries. Various studies have confirmed both men and women's desire for novel male contraceptives. Barriers to development include an absence of investment from pharmaceutical companies, concerns regarding side effects and spermatogenic rebound with hormonal methods, and lack of clear reversibility and proven effectiveness of nonhormonal methods.

Data were collected from patient records, the Swedish Neonatal Quality Register, the microbiological laboratory at KUH and the Swedish Public Health Agency. RESULTS: We identified 357 infants with GPB-BSI, representing an incidence of 1.47/1000 live births (LB). Group B streptococcus (GBS) was the most common pathogen causing BSI in full-term infants and early-onset sepsis (EOS) (0.20/1000 LB), while coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were predominant in infants born very preterm and in late-onset sepsis (LOS) (0.79/1000 LB).

There is a paucity of data on the criteria used to define sepsis and septic shock and predict mortality. Schlapbach et al. published Phoenix criteria to define sepsis in JAMA in 2024. Previously, paediatricians have used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, but these criteria lack sensitivity and specificity. This group recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Though included in the 8-point criteria, important criteria like renal and liver are missing from the main criteria. We remain worried about the way these criteria got excluded from the main criteria. Therefore, in this brief report, whilst commending the authors for this stelar task, we highlight the main pitfalls in these criteria especially the renal, neurologic, and liver criteria. These criteria have been shown to be independently associated with outcomes, and we recommend that in the future iterations of the criteria, renal and liver criteria should be defined according to latest definitions and the task force consider utilizing latest criteria for each organ system involved within the formulated criteria. CONCLUSION:  In conclusion, Phoenix criteria are a step in the right direction to define life-threatening organ dysfunction in sepsis, but clinicians need to be mindful that diagnosis/treatment of less severe sepsis should not be delayed if these criteria are not met. Therefore, local early detection and management tools for sepsis should be followed. WHAT IS KNOWN: • There has always been a quest for a definition for pediatric sepsis. There are limitations to the previous pediatric sepsis criteria which were published in 2005 by the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC). IPSCC defines sepsis as a suspected or confirmed infection in the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). These new Phoenix Pediatric Sepsis (PPS) criteria for sepsis and septic shock are intended to identify children with life-threatening organ dysfunction due to infection, and the score was developed based on a very large pediatric dataset. WHAT IS NEW: • Though the intention of Phoenix criteria is to help identify children with life threatening organ dysfunction, unfortunately the crietria will miss signs of early sepis. In this manuscript, we point out some of the drawbacks of these criteria which need to be borne in mind while applying these criteria.", "pub_date": "2024-09-11", "authors": ["Isadora Rodriguez", "Akash Deep"], "journal": "European journal of pediatrics", "doi": "10.1007/s00431-024-05767-1", "source": "pubmed"}

About 5% of total paediatric admissions to all the government hospitals in Singapore were due to acute gastroenteritis. Some 50% of the cases had no identifiable organism in the stools. Most of the remaining cases were due to bacterial or viral infections. The commonest bacteria responsible for acute gastroenteritis nowadays is Salmonella species. Other bacteria such as E. coli, Shigella and Campylobacter were responsible for a smaller proportion of bacterial diarrhoea in children. Rotavirus was the commonest viral agent responsible for acute diarrhoea among Singapore children. Most patients had mild diarrhoea and severe dehydration following acute gastroenteritis was not common. About 60% of the patients admitted to hospital were younger than two years of age. Bacterial infections were more common in infancy. Viral diarrhoea were more likely to be watery and bacterial diarrhoea were more likely to be bloody and mucoid. With regard to chronicity, it was the groups with mixed infection or bacteria infection which had a prolonged course. Treatment was directed at maintaining hydration and prevention of complications.

The side effects of the pill on the skin do not pertain, in general, to those (like thrombo-embolism or, perhaps, breast cancer) which might be life-threatening, but they are probably more frequent and may have a potential to alter the quality of life of women who use it. The aim of this paper is to review the dermatological effects of hormonal contraceptives from the point of view of everyday prescribing, with the emphasis on the quality of life of patients. The reported side effects of the pill are therefore classified according to their real or probable frequency, not to their severity or the theoretical importance of their mechanisms. As it would be unwise to speak of the risks without consideration for the benefits, an attempt is made to compare the dermatological safety profile of oral contraceptives to that of other birth control methods (barrier contraceptive methods, intrauterine devices, etc.) on the one hand; on the other hand, one insists upon the fact that the pill in itself may have health benefits, general (reduction in the incidence of some cancers) or dermatological (e. g. an effect on acne).", "pub_date": "1990-01-01", "authors": ["M Girard"], "journal": "Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie", "doi": "", "source": "pubmed"}

The United States (US) currently has the highest annual prevalence rate of cannabis consumption in the world, 17.9% in individuals aged 12 or older, and it is on the rise. With increasing cannabis use comes the potential for an increase in abuse, and according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), approximately 5.1% of Americans had Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) in 2020. Research has shown that genetics and epigenetics play a significant role in cannabis use and CUD. In fact, approximately 50-70% of liability to CUD and 40-48% of cannabis use initiation have been found to be the result of genetic factors. Cannabis usage and CUD have also been linked to an increased risk of psychiatric disorders and Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) subsets like schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. Comprehension of the genetic and epigenetic aspects of cannabinoids is necessary for future research, treatment plans, and the production of pure cannabinoid compounds, which will be essential for FDA approval.

We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.", "pub_date": "2021-03-25", "authors": ["María Cernada", "Alejandro Pinilla-González", "Julia Kuligowski", "José Manuel Morales", "Sheila Lorente-Pozo", "José David Piñeiro-Ramos", "Anna Parra-Llorca", "Inmaculada Lara-Cantón", "Máximo Vento", "Eva Serna"], "journal": "Pediatric research", "doi": "10.1038/s41390-021-01444-3", "source": "pubmed"}

We performed an external validation of the quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2, including its performance in predicting mortality in specific age groups. DESIGN: Analysis of retrospective data obtained from the Virtual Pediatric Systems PICU registry. SETTING: Prospectively collected clinical records from 130 participating PICUs in North America. PATIENTS: Children admitted between January 2009 and December 2014, with a diagnosis of infection at discharge, for whom all required data were available. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Systolic blood pressures, heart rates, and Glasgow Coma Scale scores were used to evaluate the quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Performance was compared with Pediatric Risk of Mortality 3 and Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 risk scores. Data from 42,196 children with complete data were analyzed, with median age 2.7 years (interquartile range, 0.7-8.8 yr; range 0-18 yr) and a 4.27% mortality rate. Mortality was 13.4% for quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 greater than or equal to 2 and 2.5% for quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 less than 2, representing a false-negative rate of 49.5%. Also 311 children (17%) who died had a quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 score of 0. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 72.6% (95% CI, 71.4-73.8%) for quick Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2, compared with 85.0% (95% CI, 84.0-86.0%) for Pediatric Risk of Mortality 3 and 81.5% (95% CI, 80.5-82.5%) for Pediatric Index of Mortality 2.

METHODS: The descriptive study was conducted on 278 children with SLD. Strengths and difficulties in children were evaluated by the SDQ applied to their mothers. The percentage of cases above the cut-off limits of the SDQ was calculated. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis were used for analysis. RESULTS: The mean (SD) total SDQ score was 15.8 (6.5). The percentage of scores of abnormal total difficulties in SLD was 47.8%. Multivariate analysis revealed that cases exposed to antenatal smoking had higher odds ratio of abnormal emotional symptoms and abnormal total difficulties; cases with poor familial income and the presence of a history of antenatal smoking exposure showed considerably higher odds ratio of conduct problems; cases with younger age at the diagnosis of SLD, dyscalculia, extreme duration of preschool screen time (≥4 h), and history of hospitalization had significantly higher odds ratio for hyperactivity-inattention problems; and cases having shorter breastfeeding duration had higher odds ratio of peer problems compared to counterparts.

Nevertheless, scientific research thereon is scarce which might be due to the high prevalence of sexual trauma and fear of overwhelming patients with explicit sexual content. METHODS: We investigated a clinical sample of patients diagnosed with BPD (n = 114) and compared them to a sample of matched healthy controls (HC) (n = 114) concerning the dissociative symptoms derealization, depersonalization, and conversion in sexual situations. In a subgroup of patients with BPD (n = 41) and matched HC (n = 40) dissociative symptoms after exposure to an acoustically presented erotic narrative were assessed in the lab. Regression analyses were used to examine the associations between sexual trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dissociation in sexual situations, and risky sexual behavior. RESULTS: Patients diagnosed with BPD endorsed higher dissociative symptoms in sexual situations retrospectively and in the lab compared to HC. Regression analyses revealed that depersonalization and conversion symptoms in sexual situations were explained by severity of BPD, while derealization was explained by PTSD symptomatology. Impulsive and sexual behavior with an uncommitted partner were higher in the BPD group and explained by derealization, while conversion showed an inverse association. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the importance of addressing distinct dissociative symptoms in sexual situations when counselling and treating women with BPD. In the long term, this could contribute to a reduction in sexual risk behavior in patients with BPD.

Limited knowledge of the underlying causes of ALS has made it difficult to target upstream biological mechanisms of disease, and therapeutic interventions are usually administered relatively late in the course of disease. Genetic forms of ALS offer a unique opportunity for therapeutic development, as genetic associations may reveal potential insights into disease etiology. Genetic ALS may also be amenable to investigating earlier intervention given the possibility of identifying clinically presymptomatic, at-risk individuals with causative genetic variants. There is increasing evidence for a presymptomatic phase of ALS, with biomarker data from the Pre-Symptomatic Familial ALS (Pre-fALS) study showing that an elevation in blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) precedes phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease.

The search for molecules interfering with the binding of NTCP and HBV/HDV led to design bulevirtide (BLV). This large polypeptide mimics a region of the pre-S1 HBsAg and blocks viral entry by inhibitory competition. BLV was initially tested in cell cultures, animal models and more recently in Phase I-III human trials (called 'MYRS'). As monotherapy or in combination with peginterferon, BLV is well tolerated and exhibits potent antiviral activity. Plasma viremia significantly declines and/or becomes undetectable in more than 75% of patients treated for >24 weeks. However, serum HBsAg concentrations remain unchanged. No selection of BLV resistance in HBV/HDV has been reported in vivo to date. BLV is administered subcutaneously once daily at doses between 2 and 10 mg. BLV received conditional approval in Europe in 2020 to treat chronic hepatitis delta. The advent of peginterferon lambda or new specific anti-HDV antivirals (lonafarnib, etc.) will open the door for combination therapies with BLV. Since there is no stable reservoir for HDV-RNA within infected hepatocytes, viral clearance might be achieved using antivirals for a minimum timeframe. This is what happens in hepatitis C combining several antivirals, curing nearly all patients treated for 3 months. Clearance of HDV-RNA genomes may occur despite HBV persistence as cccDNA or chromosome integrated HBV-DNA within hepatocytes. This is supported by cases of HDV elimination using BLV despite persistence of serum HBsAg. Another path for HDV cure will derive from achieving HBsAg clearance, the goal of new promising anti-HBV gene therapies (bepirovirsen, etc.). In summary, the advent of BLV has triggered a renovated interest for antiviral therapy in hepatitis delta.

The present purpose was to review relevant studies to investigate whether cannabis use can be linked to the onset of mania in bipolar disorder. METHODS: Articles published between 1972 and December 2013 were searched on Medline and PsychInfo using the following keywords: first manic episode, or onset mania, or bipolar disorder and cannabis. Relevant papers cited in the references of selected articles were further considered for inclusion into the review. RESULTS: Lifetime use of cannabis among bipolar patients appears to be around 70% and approximately 30% of patients with a bipolar disorder present a comorbidity of cannabis abuse or dependence. Cannabis use is associated with younger age at onset of first mania and with more frequent depressive or manic episodes, although the evidence is somewhat inconsistent. Likewise cannabis consumption is related to poorer outcome and an increased risk of rapid cycling or mixed episodes. In contrast, neuro-cognitive functioning seems to be positively affected in patients with psychiatric comorbidity. While cannabis use often precedes first manic episodes, the causal direction remains to be determined. LIMITATIONS: Variations in definition of cannabis use/dependence. Lack of controlled studies limiting definite conclusions about a putative causal relationship between cannabis and onset of mania. CONCLUSIONS: Further investigations are needed to clarify the relationships between cannabis use and first manic episode.", "pub_date": "2014-04-24", "authors": ["Nathalie Bally", "Daniele Zullino", "Jean-Michel Aubry"], "journal": "Journal of affective disorders", "doi": "10.1016/j.jad.2014.04.038", "source": "pubmed"}

The recent classification of vestibular migraine, jointly proposed by the Bárány Society and the International Headache Society, allows identification of vestibular migraine and probable vestibular migraine based on explicit criteria. The diagnosis is based on symptom type, severity and duration, a history of migraine, temporal association of migraine symptoms with vertigo attacks, and exclusion of other causes. Because headache is often absent during acute attacks, other migraine features such as photophobia or auras have to be specifically inquired about. During acute attacks, one may find central spontaneous or positional nystagmus, and less commonly, unilateral vestibular hypofunction. In the symptom-free interval, vestibular testing adds little to the diagnosis as findings are mostly minor and nonspecific. The pathophysiology of vestibular migraine is unknown, but several mechanisms link the trigeminal system, which is activated during migraine attacks, and the vestibular system.

As a result, tumor tissues for molecular studies and pathologic diagnosis are infrequent. New clinical trials are investigating novel medications and therapeutic techniques in an effort to improve treatment of patients with DIPGs. OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety, tolerability, and toxicity of an oncolytic adenovirus, DNX-2401, injected into the cerebellar peduncle in pediatric subjects with DIPG and to collect tumor samples of this type of tumor. METHODS: Phase I, single-center, uncontrolled trial. A tumor biopsy will be performed through the cerebellar peduncle, and DNX-2401 will be injected immediately after the biopsy. Standard therapy consisting of radiotherapy and chemotherapy will follow in 2 to 6 wk. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: Improvement of overall survival and quality of life in patients with DIPG and collection of tumor specimens to study the molecular profiling of these tumors. DISCUSSION: The aims of this trial are to contribute to the sample collection of DIPG and to offer treatment during the tumor tissue biopsy using the virus. If this virus works as expected, it could kill the tumor cells with no damage to healthy tissue, functioning as a targeted therapy.

This contributes to the delay in the diagnosis of endometriosis which is 6-11 years. So far non-invasive diagnostic approaches such as ultrasound (US), MRI or blood tests do not have sufficient diagnostic power. Our aim was to develop and validate a non-invasive diagnostic test with a high sensitivity (80% or more) for symptomatic endometriosis patients, without US evidence of endometriosis, since this is the group most in need of a non-invasive test. METHODS: A total of 28 inflammatory and non-inflammatory plasma biomarkers were measured in 353 EDTA plasma samples collected at surgery from 121 controls without endometriosis at laparoscopy and from 232 women with endometriosis (minimal-mild n = 148; moderate-severe n = 84), including 175 women without preoperative US evidence of endometriosis. Surgery was done during menstrual (n = 83), follicular (n = 135) and luteal (n = 135) phases of the menstrual cycle. For analysis, the data were randomly divided into an independent training (n = 235) and a test (n = 118) data set. Statistical analysis was done using univariate and multivariate (logistic regression and least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) approaches in training- and test data set separately to validate our findings. RESULTS: In the training set, two models of four biomarkers (Model 1: annexin V, VEGF, CA-125 and glycodelin; Model 2: annexin V, VEGF, CA-125 and sICAM-1) analysed in plasma, obtained during the menstrual phase, could predict US-negative endometriosis with a high sensitivity (81-90%) and an acceptable specificity (68-81%). The same two models predicted US-negative endometriosis in the independent validation test set with a high sensitivity (82%) and an acceptable specificity (63-75%). CONCLUSIONS: In plasma samples obtained during menstruation, multivariate analysis of four biomarkers (annexin V, VEGF, CA-125 and sICAM-1/or glycodelin) enabled the diagnosis of endometriosis undetectable by US with a sensitivity of 81-90% and a specificity of 63-81% in independent training- and test data set.

The cohort study described here is designed as a large-scale clinical validation of this previous work. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre observational study will prospectively recruit a total of 1445 newborn infants (all gestations)-1084 with suspected early-or late-onset sepsis, and 361 controls-over 4 years. A small volume of whole blood will be collected from infants with suspected sepsis at the time of presentation. This sample will be used for integrated transcriptomic, lipidomic and targeted proteomics profiling. In addition, a subset of samples will be subjected to cellular phenotype and proteomic analyses. A second sample from the same patient will be collected at 24 hours, with an opportunistic sampling for stool culture. For control infants, only one set of blood and stool sample will be collected to coincide with clinical blood sampling. Along with detailed clinical information, blood and stool samples will be analysed and the information will be used to identify and validate the efficacy of immune-metabolic networks in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal sepsis and to identify new host biomarkers for viral sepsis.

While GSEA has been playing a significant role in understanding transcriptomic data, no similar tools are currently available for understanding metabolomic data. Here, we introduce a web-based server, called Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA), to help researchers identify and interpret patterns of human or mammalian metabolite concentration changes in a biologically meaningful context. Key to the development of MSEA has been the creation of a library of approximately 1000 predefined metabolite sets covering various metabolic pathways, disease states, biofluids, and tissue locations. MSEA also supports user-defined or custom metabolite sets for more specialized analysis. MSEA offers three different enrichment analyses for metabolomic studies including overrepresentation analysis (ORA), single sample profiling (SSP) and quantitative enrichment analysis (QEA). ORA requires only a list of compound names, while SSP and QEA require both compound names and compound concentrations. MSEA generates easily understood graphs or tables embedded with hyperlinks to relevant pathway images and disease descriptors. For non-mammalian or more specialized metabolomic studies, MSEA allows users to provide their own metabolite sets for enrichment analysis. The MSEA server also supports conversion between metabolite common names, synonyms, and major database identifiers. MSEA has the potential to help users identify obvious as well as 'subtle but coordinated' changes among a group of related metabolites that may go undetected with conventional approaches.

The pathophysiology of these symptoms may in part, be ascribed to activated immune pathways, although it is unclear whether muscular factors play a role in their onset. The aim of the present study is to examine the role of muscle proteins in major depression in association with symptoms of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. We measured serum levels of agrin, talin-2, titin, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) as well as the FibroFatigue (FF), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) scores in 60 MDD patients and 30 healthy controls. The results show a significant increase in agrin and talin-2 in MDD patients as compared with controls. There were highly significant correlations between agrin and HAM-D, BDI-II and FF scores. Agrin, but not talin or titin, was significantly and positively associated with all 12 items of the FF scale. We found that a large part of the variance in HAM-D (47.4%), BDI-II (43.4%) and FF (43.5%) scores was explained by the regression on agrin, smoking, female sex (positively associated) and education (inversely associated). CPK was significantly and inversely associated with the total FF score and with muscle and gastro-intestinal symptoms, fatigue, a flu-like malaise, headache and memory, autonomic and sleep disturbances. These results suggest that aberrations in neuromuscular (NMJs) and myotendinous junctions play a role in MDD and that the aberrations in NMJs coupled with lowered CPK may play a role in chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia symptoms in MDD. Moreover, the increase of agrin in MDD probably functions as part of the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS).", "pub_date": "2019-11-16", "authors": ["Hussein Kadhem Al-Hakeim", "Ameer Abdul Razzaq Al-Issa", "Michael Maes"], "journal": "Metabolic brain disease", "doi": "10.1007/s11011-019-00506-0", "source": "pubmed"}

Fatigue is a symptom often associated with autoimmune diseases. Chronic inflammatory response and activated cell-mediated immunity are associated with cardiovascular myopathies which can be driven by muscle weakness and fatigue. Thus, we hypothesize that immune dysfunction-driven changes in myocyte mitochondria may play a critical role in fatigue-related pathogenesis. We show that persistent low-level expression of IFN-γ in designated IFN-γ AU-Rich Element deletion mice (ARE mice) under androgen exposure resulted in mitochondrial and metabolic deficiencies in myocytes from male or castrated ARE mice. Most notably, echocardiography unveiled that low ejection fraction in the left ventricle post-stress correlated with mitochondrial deficiencies, explaining how heart function decreases under stress. We report that inefficiencies and structural changes in mitochondria, with changes to expression of mitochondrial genes, are linked to male-biased fatigue and acute cardiomyopathy under stress. Our work highlights how male androgen hormone backgrounds and active autoimmunity reduce mitochondrial function and the ability to cope with stress and how pharmacological blockade of stress signal protects heart function. These studies provide new insight into the diverse actions of IFN-γ in fatigue, energy metabolism, and autoimmunity. © 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

The B-Together study investigated if sequential bepirovirsen and pegylated interferon-α-2a (Peg-IFN) therapy can reduce relapse rates and improve response rates. METHODS: In this phase IIb, multicentre, open-label trial, participants on stable nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy were randomised 1:1 to bepirovirsen 300 mg once weekly (plus loading dose on Days 4 and 11) for 24 (Arm 1) or 12 (Arm 2) weeks followed by Peg-IFN 180 μg once weekly for up to 24 weeks, with up to 36 weeks follow-up. Participants continued NA therapy throughout. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with HBsAg <0.05 IU/ml and HBV DNA <LLOQ for 24 weeks after planned end of Peg-IFN treatment, in the absence of newly initiated antiviral therapy. RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 108 participants (Arm 1, n = 55; Arm 2, n = 53). The primary outcome was achieved by 5 (9%) participants in Arm 1 and 8 (15%) in Arm 2. All responders had baseline HBsAg ≤3,000 IU/ml. Indirect comparison with the phase IIb study B-Clear indicates that sequential addition of Peg-IFN may reduce the relapse rates previously observed with bepirovirsen alone. The proportions of participants with adverse events and treatment-related adverse events in both treatment windows were similar between treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential therapy with bepirovirsen followed by Peg-IFN is tolerable and effective in participants with chronic HBV infection on stable NA therapy. This proof-of-concept trial demonstrates a potential strategy to extend responses to bepirovirsen by reducing relapse. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This phase IIb study investigated whether sequential therapy with bepirovirsen followed by Peg-IFN could improve off-treatment response rates to bepirovirsen alone by converting partial bepirovirsen responders to full responders and/or reducing relapse rates in participants with chronic HBV. These data show that sequential therapy with bepirovirsen followed by Peg-IFN is tolerable and effective; in patients with a bepirovirsen response, sequential treatment with Peg-IFN may help to reduce off-treatment relapses in participants on stable NA. Participants had a similar response during bepirovirsen treatment as seen in B-Clear, with increased response rates in participants with lower baseline HBsAg; all responders to the sequential regimen had baseline HBsAg <3000 IU/mL. As the first study of antisense oligonucleotide-mediated RNA silencing followed by interferon immunomodulation in patients with chronic HBV infection, this study is an important proof-of-concept for sequential therapy, shedding light on the therapeutic potential of utilising immunomodulators following suppression of HBV antigens.

The advantages of early detection for patients and their caregivers include early receipt of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies, and early access to appropriate agencies and/or support networks. The disadvantages include psychological damage related to anxiety and depression, and risk of stigmatization and/or social exclusion. The possibility of false positive diagnoses is also problematic. For detection of dementia, various screening tests and questionnaires have been developed. However, none of these techniques are sensitive and specific enough to avoid false positives. Thus, these screening tools are recommended for assessment of the severity of functional decline after sufficient information has been gathered to suspect dementia.

For effective implementation of early diagnosis and management of dementia, measures are required to improve social and human resources, including the following: improvement of the diagnostic abilities of general practitioners, improvement of necessary care and support systems after diagnosis, and organizing volunteers to support local communities. Under a community-based integrated care system, each community will create a \"tailored\" system that meets the health needs, health status and values of the community. Promoting social participation and community involvement of the residents should be one of the key strategies to address the shortage of human resources.", "pub_date": "2014-04-01", "authors": ["Yohko Maki", "Haruyasu Yamaguchi"], "journal": "Geriatrics & gerontology international", "doi": "10.1111/ggi.12259", "source": "pubmed"}

Lecanemab, defined as an anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) drug, comprises an antibody against Aβ, a protein structure believed to cause Alzheimer's disease. This drug represents a new direction in dementia treatment. In a phase III study, lecanemab was found to significantly slow cognitive decline, while showing manageable levels of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, which are side-effects of lecanemab. Furthermore, lecanemab has been shown to effectively reduce Aβ accumulation in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, which might contribute not only to delaying the progression of cognitive decline, but also to improving the quality of life of patients and their families. However, there are conditions for the use of lecanemab, for which the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has issued the Guidelines for Promotion of Optimal Use. These guidelines specify requirements for appropriate patient selection, prescribing physicians and administering medical institutions to ensure safe and effective use. Particular emphasis is placed on the confirmation of amyloid-β accumulation, amyloid-related imaging abnormalities risk management and appropriate handling of side-effects. The clinical use of lecanemab represents an important advancement in the treatment of dementia; however, the understanding and cooperation of healthcare professionals, patients and families are essential to maximize its efficacy and safety. Future issues to be addressed include the sustainability and long-term efficacy of treatment, improvement of clinical symptoms after removal of Aβ and motivation to administer the drug. Although lecanemab offers hope for the treatment of dementia, its use requires careful management.

Since this law took effect, increased availability and use of cannabis in Michigan have led to increased emergency department (ED) visits associated with the drug's psychiatric effects. OBJECTIVES: To describe cannabis-induced anxiety disorder's prevalence, clinical features, and disposition in a community-based study. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive patients diagnosed with acute toxicity related to cannabis use (ICD-10 code F12). Patients were seen at seven EDs over a 24-month study period. Data collected included demographics, clinical features, and treatment outcomes in ED patients who met the criteria for cannabis-induced anxiety disorder. This group was compared to a cohort experiencing other forms of acute cannabis toxicity. Chi-squared and t-tests were used to compare these two groups across key demographic and outcome variables. RESULTS: During the study period, 1135 patients were evaluated for acute cannabis toxicity. A total of 196 patients (17.3%) had a chief complaint of anxiety, and 939 (82.7%) experienced other forms of acute cannabis toxicity, predominantly symptoms of intoxication or cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. Patients with anxiety symptoms had panic attacks (11.7%), aggression or manic behavior (9.2%), and hallucinations (6.1%). Compared to patients presenting with other forms of cannabis toxicity, those with anxiety were likelier to be younger, ingested edible cannabis, had psychiatric comorbidities, or had a history of polysubstance abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis-induced anxiety occurred in 17.3% of ED patients in this community-based study.

Recently, a new market for cannabidiol (CBD) products has emerged called \"cannabis light\" or \"cannabis well-being\". In parallel, the experimentation of medical cannabis began on March 26, 2021, for specific indications. Some clinical effects of cannabis have been put forward for medical purposes; however, these are counterbalanced by adverse events (AEs). Data from addictovigilance and international literature on the risks associated with non-medical cannabis use have helped establish exclusion criteria for patients at risk of complications when using medical cannabis (such as those with psychotic disorders, severe cardiovascular, renal, or liver conditions). This also enables the early identification of AEs. Cannabis-based medications are composed of cannabidiol (CBD) and/or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in varying concentrations. We aimed to present the contribution of the addictovigilance data regarding cannabis-related reports to the ongoing French experimentation on cannabis used for medical purposes, to anticipate potential adverse drug reactions in the treated patients. Among the 3164 patients included in the French experimentation, 1186 of them presented at least one AE. Some of the AEs reported in addictovigilance surveys on non-medical cannabis and CBD were observed during the experimentation of medical cannabis such as cardiovascular AEs (myocardial infarction, strokes, transient ischemic attack), psychiatric AEs (suicidal idea and attempt, depression), worsening of epilepsy, cognitive and/or sedative disorders. Given the potential for pharmacodependence of cannabis medications, it seems important for clinicians to gather the addiction history of their patients (past or present), particularly the use of non-medical cannabis (illicit) and non-medical CBD, to prevent and early detect any risk of abuse. The generalization of the use of medical cannabis was adopted and defined in the 2024 Social Security Financing Act. These medications will be accessible to patients by medical prescription for defined indications. Addictovigilance as well as pharmacovigilance monitoring is crucial in this context of continuing to make medical cannabis available in France. Adverse effects of interest will need to be monitored in particular, including neurological disorders (epilepsy exacerbation, cognitive disorders), psychiatric disorders (substance use disorder, suicidal behaviour), and cardiovascular disorders as well as any unexpected AEs.

The current study is aimed at discovering reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal EOS through transcriptomic analysis of publicly available datasets. Whole blood mRNA expression profiling of neonatal EOS patients in the GSE25504 dataset was downloaded and analyzed. The binomial LASSO model was constructed to select genes that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS. Then, ROC curves were generated to assess the performance of the predictive features in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network was established to explore the potential biological mechanisms of genes within the model. Four genes (CST7, CD3G, CD247, and ANKRD22) were identified that most accurately predicted neonatal EOS and were subsequently used to construct a diagnostic model. ROC analysis revealed that this diagnostic model performed well in differentiating between neonatal EOS and normal infants in both the GSE25504 dataset and our clinical cohort. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA network consisting of the four genes and potential target miRNAs was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, a diagnostic four-gene model that can accurately distinguish neonatal EOS in newborns with bacterial infection was constructed, which can be used as an auxiliary test for diagnosing neonatal EOS with bacterial infection in the future. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of neonatal EOS patients from public databases to develop a genetic model for predicting sepsis, which could provide insight into early molecular changes and biological mechanisms of neonatal EOS. WHAT IS KNOWN: • Infants with suspected EOS usually receive empiric antibiotic therapy directly after birth. • When blood cultures are negative after 48 to 72 hours, empirical antibiotic treatment is often halted. Needless to say, this is not a short time. Additionally, because of the concern for inadequate clinical sepsis production and the limited sensitivity of blood cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy for the kid is typically extended. WHAT IS NEW: • We established a 4-gene diagnostic model of neonatal EOS with bacterial infection by bioinformatics analysis method. The model has better diagnostic performance compared with conventional inflammatory indicators such as CRP, Hb, NEU%, and PCT.", "pub_date": "2022-12-17", "authors": ["Yong Bai", "Na Zhao", "Zhenhua Zhang", "Yangjie Jia", "Genhao Zhang", "Geng Dong"], "journal": "European journal of pediatrics", "doi": "10.1007/s00431-022-04753-9", "source": "pubmed"}

We examined preferences based on their rankings and conducted bivariate analyses. Collapsing the various specialists (men's health doctor, hormonal doctor, reproductive health doctor, and family planning clinician) into a single provider type, we examined participant demographics against provider preference (regular doctor, pharmacist, or specialist).

This study investigated the relationship between intimate partner violence, severe acute maternal morbidity in the intensive care unit (ICU), and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study in a hospital in Lima, Peru, with 109 cases (maternal ICU admissions) and 109 controls (obstetric patients not admitted to the ICU). Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and medical record review. Partner violence was assessed using the World Health Organization instrument. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the association between intimate partner violence and severe acute maternal morbidity. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher rate of intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy among cases (58.7%) than controls (27.5%). In multivariate analysis, intimate partner violence both before and during pregnancy (aOR 3.83 (95% CI: 1.99-7.37)), being married (3.86 (1.27-11.73)), having <8 antenatal care visits (2.78 (1.14-6.80)), and having previous abortions (miscarriage, therapeutic, or unsafe) (1.69 (1.13-2.51)) were significantly associated with severe acute maternal morbidity.

This study compares the effectiveness of an at-home high-intensity stretch (HIS) device to traditional physical therapy (PT) and to PT in combination with the HIS device. We hypothesize that the HIS device will be as effective as PT alone or as combination therapy in the first-line treatment of AC and use of the HIS device will exhibit improvement at higher rate. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with idiopathic adhesive capsulitis and a minimum of 12 months follow-up were included in this study. Patients were randomized into one of the three groups: HIS device, PT alone, or HIS device + PT. Passive range of motion (ROM), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), and Simple Shoulder Test (SST) scores were measured. Additionally, patient satisfaction, compliance and complications were recorded. Paired t-test, ANOVA and Chi-squared tests were used in analysis. RESULTS: Final ROM in all planes improved for all groups compared to baseline (p < 0.001), with only HIS device group able to restore > 95% of contralateral ROM in all planes at final follow-up. Patients with PT alone were on average slowest to improve ROM from baseline, at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year in all planes except internal rotation.

A primary condition observed in septic patients is the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils into the lung. Prior studies have shown differences in pulmonary neutrophil accumulation in C57BL/6J (B6) and A/J mice after endotoxic and septic shock. However, the mechanism by which neutrophils accumulate in the lung after polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture still remains to be fully elucidated. We show in this study that lung inflammation, characterized by neutrophil infiltration and expression of inflammatory cytokines, was aggravated in B6 as compared with A/J mice and correlated with a high expression of p19, the interleukin 23 (IL-23)-specific subunit. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide stimulation of B6- and A/J-derived macrophages, one of the main producers of IL-23 and IL-12, revealed that B6 mice favored the production of IL-23, whereas A/J-derived macrophages expressed higher levels of IL-12. In addition, expression of IL-17, known to be upregulated by IL-23, was also more elevated in the lung of B6 mice when compared with that in the lung of A/J mice. In contrast, pulmonary expression of interferon-γ was much more pronounced in A/J than that in B6 mice, which was most likely a result of a higher production of IL-12. The expression of the IL-17-dependent neutrophil recruitment factors chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 2 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was also higher in B6 mice. Altogether, these results suggest that increased activation of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway has detrimental effects on sepsis-induced lung inflammation, whereas activation of the IL-12/interferon-γ pathway may lead, in contrast, to less pronounced inflammatory events. These two pathways may become possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.", "pub_date": "2014-09-01", "authors": ["David M Cauvi", "Michael R Williams", "Jose A Bermudez", "Gabrielle Armijo", "Antonio De Maio"], "journal": "Shock (Augusta, Ga.)", "doi": "10.1097/SHK.0000000000000207", "source": "pubmed"}

METHODS: Three datasets (GSE77087, GSE69606 and GSE41374) containing 183 blood samples of RSV infected patients and 33 blood samples of healthy controls from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were downloaded and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out. The function and pathway enrichments were analyzed through Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for DEGs was constructed through Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). The module analysis was performed by Cytoscape software and hub genes were identified. Clinical verification was employed to verify the expression level of top five hub genes among 72 infants including 50 RSV infected patients and 22 non-RSV-infected patients hospitalized in our center. Further, the RSV infected infants with high-expression IFI27 and those with low-expression IFI27 were compared (defined as higher or lower than the median mRNA level). Finally, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) focusing on IFI27 was carried out. RESULTS: Totally, 4028 DEGs were screened out and among which, 131 most significant DEGs were selected. Subsequently, 13 hub genes were identified, and function and pathway enrichments of hub genes mainly were: response to virus, defense response to virus, regulation of viral genome replication and regulation of viral life cycle. Furthermore, IFI27 was confirmed to be the most significantly expressed in clinical verification. Gene sets associated with calcium signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix receptor interaction and so on were significantly enriched when IFI27 was highly expressed. Moreover, high-expression IFI27 was associated with more severe cases (p = 0.041), more requirements of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.034), more frequent hospitalization (p < 0.001) and longer cumulative hospital stay (p = 0.012).

The pathophysiology of these symptoms is not entirely clear, and current treatments are only partially effective. Clinically, these symptoms share signs of anhedonia, such as reduced motivation and a lack of positive affect. In the brain, they are associated with overlapping structural and functional alterations in areas involved in reward processing. Moreover, neuroinflammation has been shown to directly impede monoaminergic neurotransmission that plays a key role in reward processing. Here, we review recent neuroimaging and neuroimmunological findings, which indicate that dysfunctional reward processing might represent a shared functional mechanism fostering the symptom cluster of fatigue, depression, and pain in MS.

However, there is very little known about TMEM gene expression, especially in cancer tissue. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequence may facilitate the understanding of this poorly characterized protein genes in PDAC. METHODS: We selected the TMEM family genes through the Human Protein Atlas and characterized their expression by single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. Identification of the key TMEM genes was performed through three machine learning algorithms: LASSO, SVM-RFE and RF-SRC. Then, we established TMEM gene riskscore and estimate its implication in predicting survival and response to systematic therapy. Additionally, we explored the difference and impact of TMEM gene expression in PDAC through immunohistochemistry and cell line research. RESULTS: 5 key TMEM genes (ANO1, TMEM59, TMEM204, TMEM205, TMEM92) were selected based on the single-cell analysis and machine learning survival outcomes. Patients stratified into the high and low-risk groups based on TMEM riskscore, were observed with distinct overall survival in internal and external datasets. Moreover, through bulk RNA-sequence and immunohistochemical staining we verified the protein expression of TMEM genes in PDAC and revealed TMEM92 as an essential regulator of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSION: Our study on TMEM gene expression and behavior in PDAC has revealed unique characteristics, offering potential for precise therapeutic approaches.

METHODS: Retrospective study, which evaluated data from patients admitted from January to December 2011 in the pediatric intensive care unit of the Children's Hospital of the University of Cairo. RESULTS: Out of 237 patients in the study, 72% had multiple organ dysfunctions, and 45% had sepsis with multiple organ dysfunctions. The mortality rate in patients with multiple organ dysfunction was 73%. Independent risk factors for death were mechanical ventilation and neurological failure [OR: 36 and 3.3, respectively]. The PRISM III score was more accurate than the PELOD score in predicting death, with a Hosmer-Lemeshow X2 (Chi-square value) of 7.3 (df = 8, p = 0.5). The area under the curve was 0.723 for PRISM III and 0.78 for PELOD. CONCLUSION: A multiple organ dysfunctions was associated with high mortality. Sepsis was the major cause. Pneumonia, diarrhea and central nervous system infections were the major causes of sepsis. PRISM III had a better calibration than the PELOD for prognosis of the patients, despite the high frequency of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

Given its importance in terms of morbidity and mortality, a number of initiatives by several professional societies in recent years have led to the development of guidelines for the recognition and timely management of sepsis. The principal elements of the most recent guidelines are summarized in this practice point. These elements include recognition of changes in clinical condition and vital signs, such as fever, tachycardia, and changes in peripheral perfusion, which should raise concern for sepsis; initial stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation; timely administration of empiric antimicrobial therapy; use of fluid boluses and vasoactive medications; and specific considerations in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as the use of corticosteroids for possible adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic-adrenal suppression. Two changes from previous guidelines are the concern for fluid overload, implying the need for clinical re-assessment after administration of each fluid bolus, and the removal of dopamine as the initial vasoactive agent for use in hypotensive paediatric patients, with recommendations for the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine as dictated by the clinical context.

However, the SOFA score is not adjusted for age and therefore not suitable for children. OBJECTIVES: To adapt and validate a pediatric version of the SOFA score (pSOFA) in critically ill children and to evaluate the Sepsis-3 definitions in patients with confirmed or suspected infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective observational cohort study included all critically ill children 21 years or younger admitted to a 20-bed, multidisciplinary, tertiary pediatric intensive care unit between January 1, 2009 and August 1, 2016. Data on these children were obtained from an electronic health record database. The pSOFA score was developed by adapting the original SOFA score with age-adjusted cutoffs for the cardiovascular and renal systems and by expanding the respiratory criteria to include noninvasive surrogates of lung injury. Daily pSOFA scores were calculated from admission until day 28 of hospitalization, discharge, or death (whichever came first). Three additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were calculated for comparison. EXPOSURES: Organ dysfunction measured by the pSOFA score, and sepsis and septic shock according to the Sepsis-3 definitions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The daily pSOFA scores and additional pediatric organ dysfunction scores were compared. Performance was evaluated using the area under the curve. The pSOFA score was then used to assess the Sepsis-3 definitions in the subgroup of children with confirmed or suspected infection. RESULTS: In all, 6303 patients with 8711 encounters met inclusion criteria. Each encounter was treated independently. Of the 8482 survivors of hospital encounters, 4644 (54.7%) were male and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 69 (17-156) months. Among the 229 nonsurvivors, 127 (55.4%) were male with a median (IQR) age of 43 (8-144) months. In-hospital mortality was 2.6%. The maximum pSOFA score had excellent discrimination for in-hospital mortality, with an area under the curve of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92-0.95). The pSOFA score had a similar or better performance than other pediatric organ dysfunction scores. According to the Sepsis-3 definitions, 1231 patients (14.1%) were classified as having sepsis and had a mortality rate of 12.1%, and 347 (4.0%) had septic shock and a mortality rate of 32.3%. Patients with sepsis were more likely to die than patients with confirmed or suspected infection but no sepsis (odds ratio, 18; 95% CI, 11-28). Of the 229 patients who died during their hospitalization, 149 (65.0%) had sepsis or septic shock during their course. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The pSOFA score was adapted and validated with age-adjusted variables in critically ill children. Using the pSOFA score, the Sepsis-3 definitions were assessed in children with confirmed or suspected infection. This study is the first assessment, to date, of the Sepsis-3 definitions in critically ill children.

Over 60 years later, this is still the case as the only practical, effective contraceptive options available to men are condoms and vasectomy. However, there are now a variety of promising hormonal and non-hormonal male contraceptive options being studied. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide clinicians and laypeople with focused, up-to-date descriptions of novel strategies and targets for male contraception. We include a cautiously optimistic discussion of benefits and potential drawbacks, highlighting several methods in preclinical and clinical stages of development. RESULTS: As of June 2023, two hormonal male contraceptive methods are undergoing phase II clinical trials for safety and efficacy. A large-scale, international phase IIb trial investigating efficacy of transdermal segesterone acetate (Nestorone) plus testosterone gel has enrolled over 460 couples with completion estimated for late 2024. A second hormonal method, dimethandrolone undecanoate, is in two clinical trials focusing on safety, pharmacodynamics, suppression of spermatogenesis and hormones; the first of these two is estimated for completion in December 2024. There are also several non-hormonal methods with strong potential in preclinical stages of development. CONCLUSIONS: There exist several hurdles to novel male contraception. Therapeutic development takes decades of time, meticulous work, and financial investment, but with so many strong candidates it is our hope that there will soon be several safe, effective, and reversible contraceptive options available to male patients. RéSUMé: CONTEXTE: Depuis la sortie de la pilule contraceptive orale combinée en 1960, les femmes ont assumé le fardeau de la contraception et de la planification familiale. Plus de 60 ans plus tard, c’est toujours le cas, car les seules options contraceptives pratiques et efficaces disponibles pour les hommes sont les préservatifs et la vasectomie. Cependant, il existe maintenant une variété d’options contraceptives masculines hormonales et non hormonales prometteuses qui sont à l’étude. Le but de cette revue narrative est de fournir aux cliniciens et aux profanes des descriptions ciblées et à jour de nouvelles stratégies et cibles pour la contraception masculine. Nous incluons une discussion prudemment optimiste sur les avantages et les inconvénients potentiels, en soulignant plusieurs méthodes aux stades précliniques et cliniques du développement. RéSULTATS: En juin 2023, deux méthodes contraceptives masculines hormonales faisaient l’objet d’essais cliniques de phase II pour leur innocuité et leur efficacité. Un essai international de phase IIb à grande échelle, portant sur l’efficacité de l’acétate de ségestérone transdermique (Nestorone) et du gel de testostérone, a recruté plus de 460 couples et devrait être achevé pour la fin de 2024. Une seconde méthode hormonale, l’undécanoate de diméthandrolone, fait l’objet de deux essais cliniques axés sur l’innocuité, la pharmacodynamique, la suppression de la spermatogenèse et des hormones; le premier de ces deux essais devrait être achevé en décembre 2024. Il existe également plusieurs méthodes non hormonales à fort potentiel aux stades précliniques de développement. CONCLUSIONS: Il existe plusieurs obstacles à la nouvelle contraception masculine.

Therapeutic strategies for this serious condition are very limited. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is a cytokine that is implicated in cancer cachexia and may represent both a biomarker of cancer cachexia and a potential therapeutic target. Ponsegromab is a potent and selective humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits GDF-15-mediated signalling. Preclinical and preliminary phase 1 data suggest that ponsegromab-mediated inactivation of circulating GDF-15 may lead to improvement in key characteristics of cachexia. The primary objective of this phase 2 study is to assess the effect of ponsegromab on body weight in patients with cancer, cachexia and elevated GDF-15 concentrations. Secondary objectives include assessing physical activity, physical function, actigraphy, appetite, nausea and vomiting, fatigue and safety. Exploratory objectives include evaluating pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, lumbar skeletal muscle index and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. METHODS: Approximately 168 adults with non-small-cell lung, pancreatic or colorectal cancers who have cachexia and elevated GDF-15 concentrations will be randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT05546476). Participants meeting eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to one of three dose groups of ponsegromab (100, 200 or 400 mg) or matching placebo administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for an initial 12-week treatment period. This is followed by optional open-label treatment with ponsegromab of 400 mg administered every 4 weeks for up to 1 year. The primary endpoint is mean change from baseline in body weight at Week 12.

Treatment effects vary widely with no clear superiority of a single treatment approach. Further evaluation of contemporary and effective treatments in CYP is needed. Metacognitive therapy (MCT) has shown enhanced efficacy over 'gold standard' approaches in adult mental health, but so far has not been evaluated in a randomised trial of CYP. As such, we aim to assess the acceptability and feasibility of group-MCT for CYP with common mental health problems in comparison to usual treatment within Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). METHOD: YoMeta is a multicentre, two-arm, single-blind randomised feasibility trial comparing group-MCT to usual care in CYP with common mental health problems in CAMHS. CYP (target sample n = 100) with a common mental health problem will be recruited across at least three CAMHS services in the UK. Participants in the intervention arm will receive up to eight sessions of group-MCT delivered by a CAMHS mental health practitioner. The control arm will receive usual care in CAMHS which includes individual or group-based therapy. Feasibility will be assessed by the success of recruitment, retention, and data quality. Acceptability of the intervention will be assessed by the number of sessions attended and through qualitative interviews aimed at exploring CYP acceptability and understanding of the intervention. Symptoms of psychological distress will be assessed using the Revised Children Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) at 20 weeks. We will also assess psychological well-being, symptoms of depression, metacognitive beliefs, quality of life, and measures to support economic evaluation (health status and health and social care use). Qualitative interviews will be conducted to understand practitioner's views on training and delivery of group-MCT. DISCUSSION: The trial is designed to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of group-MCT for CYP with common mental health problems. Group-MCT may aid in improving access to treatment, reduce waiting times, and improve outcomes for CYP with common mental health disorders. The study will provide important information and data to evaluate future research potential and confirm sample size estimation for a definitive large-scale RCT to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group-MCT in CYP.

Globally, cannabis is among the most commonly used drugs, and cannabis use frequently begins in adolescence or emerging adulthood, both important periods of development and periods in which psychiatric symptoms and disorders frequently emerge. Thus, the relationships between cannabis use and mental illnesses are essential for nurses and other healthcare professionals and researchers to explore and understand. This literature review examines the relationships between cannabis use and depression, anxiety, and suicide. It includes a primer on the neurobiology of cannabis effects; an overview on the epidemiological evidence on the associations between cannabis use and depression, anxiety, and suicide; and a discussion of implications for nurses, particularly important given changes in the medical and recreational cannabis legislation in North America. Overall, this review found consistent evidence showing a cross-sectional association between recreational cannabis use and depression, anxiety, and suicide, despite some limitations and conflicts in the literature.

Expanding research on the human microbiome now allows ME/CFS-associated pathogens to be studied as interacting members of human microbiome communities. Humans harbor these vast ecosystems of bacteria, viruses and fungi in nearly all tissue and blood. Most well-studied inflammatory conditions are tied to dysbiosis or imbalance of the human microbiome. While gut microbiome dysbiosis has been identified in ME/CFS, microbes and viruses outside the gut can also contribute to the illness. Pathobionts, and their associated proteins/metabolites, often control human metabolism and gene expression in a manner that pushes the body toward a state of illness. Intracellular pathogens, including many associated with ME/CFS, drive microbiome dysbiosis by directly interfering with human transcription, translation, and DNA repair processes. Molecular mimicry between host and pathogen proteins/metabolites further complicates this interference. Other human pathogens disable mitochondria or dysregulate host nervous system signaling. Antibodies and/or clonal T cells identified in patients with ME/CFS are likely activated in response to these persistent microbiome pathogens. Different human pathogens have evolved similar survival mechanisms to disable the host immune response and host metabolic pathways. The metabolic dysfunction driven by these organisms can result in similar clusters of inflammatory symptoms.

Administration of sex steroids to men can shut off sperm production through effects on the pituitary and hypothalamus. However, this approach also decreases production of testosterone, so \"add-back\" therapy is needed. OBJECTIVES: To summarize all randomized controlled trials of male hormonal contraception. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the computerized databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Popline, and LILACS (each from inception to February, 2003) for randomized controlled trials of hormonal contraception in men. We wrote to authors of identified trials to seek unpublished or published trials that we might have missed. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized controlled trials in any language that compared a steroid hormone with another contraceptive. We excluded non-steroidal male contraceptives, such as gossypol. We included both placebo and active-regimen control groups. All trials identified included only healthy men with normal semen analyses. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Azoospermia (absence of spermatozoa on semen examination) was the primary outcome measure. Data were insufficient to examine pregnancy rates and side effects. MAIN RESULTS: The proportion of men who achieved azoospermia varied widely in reports to date. Few significant differences emerged from these trials. Levonorgestrel implants combined with injectable testosterone enanthate (100 mg IM) was significantly more effective than was levonorgestrel 125 mcg by mouth daily combined with testosterone patches (10 mg/d) (OR for azoospermia with the oral levonorgestrel regimen 0.03; 95%CI 0.00-0.29). The addition of levonorgestrel 500 mcg by mouth daily improved the effectiveness of testosterone enanthate 100 mg IM weekly by itself (OR for azoospermia with the combined regimen 4.0; 95%CI 1.00-15.99). Several regimens, including testosterone alone and GnRH agonists and antagonists, had disappointing results. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: No male hormonal contraceptive is ready for clinical use. All trials published to date have been small exploratory studies. As a result, their power to detect important differences has been limited and their results imprecise. In addition, the definition of oligospermia has been imprecise or inconsistent in many reports. To avoid bias, future trials need more attention to the methodological requirements for randomized controlled trials.

This study aims to explore how different types of childhood trauma affect these features in bipolar versus unipolar depressive disorders. METHODS: We included 839 participants of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) with a lifetime diagnosis of major depressive disorder single episode (MDDS; N = 443), recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD-R; N = 331), or bipolar disorder (BD; N = 65). Multivariate regression was used to analyze data from the Childhood Trauma Interview and borderline features (from the self-report Personality Assessment Inventory). RESULTS: On average, participants were 48.6 years old (SD: 12.6), with 69.2 % being women, and 50.3 % of participants assessed positive for childhood trauma. Adjusted analyses revealed that participants diagnosed with BD, followed by MDD-R, exhibited the highest number of borderline personality features. Additionally, within the entire group, a strong association was found between childhood trauma, especially emotional neglect, and the presence of borderline personality features.

There is no definitive gold standard for its treatment, the primary therapeutic objectives of which are the reduction of pain and the restoration of shoulder range of motion. The aim of our study was to analyze treatment outcomes based on quantitative measures of shoulder function and symptom relief. METHOD: Conducted between January 2022 and April 2023, the research involved 45 patients initially diagnosed with adhesive capsulitis and associated fibroadhesive bursitis. After excluding nine patients for other concomitant pathologies (five for calcific tendinopathy and four for rotator cuff injury), 36 patients were randomized into two groups: one group was treated with glenohumeral hydrodistension, the other with glenohumeral hydrodistension combined with bursal injection. Assessments were conducted at baseline and then 2, 4, and 6 months after treatment, focusing on changes in pain levels, functional scores, and range of motion in all planes. Each group followed a home-based rehabilitation protocol. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in both treatment groups, with the combined hydrodistension and bursal injection group showing notably superior outcomes. Specifically, the range of motion in flexion improved from an initial median of 80° to 155° in the combined treatment group, compared to an increase from 75.5° to 129° in the group treated with hydrodistension alone. This enhancement was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Regarding pain reduction, the combined treatment group demonstrated a dramatic decrease in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, from a baseline median of 7 to 1 at the 6-month follow-up. In contrast, the hydrodistension-only group showed a reduction from 7 to 3, with these differences also proving statistically significant (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided hydrodistension of the glenohumeral joint, if combined with bursal injection and specific exercises, effectively reduces pain, decreases disability, and improves range of motion in patients with second-stage adhesive capsulitis. This study highlights the importance of a combined approach in the management of this complex condition, especially after the histological changes that occurred after COVID-19 and related vaccinations.

Originally GSEA was developed for interpreting microarray gene expression data, but it can be applied to any sorted list of genes. Given the gene list and an arbitrary biological category, GSEA evaluates whether the genes of the considered category are randomly distributed or accumulated on top or bottom of the list. Usually, significance scores (p-values) of GSEA are computed by nonparametric permutation tests, a time consuming procedure that yields only estimates of the p-values. RESULTS: We present a novel dynamic programming algorithm for calculating exact significance values of unweighted Gene Set Enrichment Analyses. Our algorithm avoids typical problems of nonparametric permutation tests, as varying findings in different runs caused by the random sampling procedure. Another advantage of the presented dynamic programming algorithm is its runtime and memory efficiency. To test our algorithm, we applied it not only to simulated data sets, but additionally evaluated expression profiles of squamous cell lung cancer tissue and autologous unaffected tissue.", "pub_date": "2007-08-06", "authors": ["Andreas Keller", "Christina Backes", "Hans-Peter Lenhof"], "journal": "BMC bioinformatics", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-8-290", "source": "pubmed"}

OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the performance of a multicenter network for ultra-rapid genomic diagnosis in a public health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Descriptive feasibility study of critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions treated at 12 Australian hospitals between March 2018 and February 2019, with data collected to May 2019. A formal implementation strategy emphasizing communication and feedback, standardized processes, coordination, distributed leadership, and collective learning was used to facilitate adoption. EXPOSURES: Ultra-rapid exome sequencing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report. The secondary outcomes were the molecular diagnostic yield, the change in clinical management after the ultra-rapid exome sequencing report, the time from hospital admission to the laboratory report, and the proportion of laboratory reports returned prior to death or hospital discharge. RESULTS: The study population included 108 patients with a median age of 28 days (range, 0 days to 17 years); 34% were female; and 57% were from neonatal intensive care units, 33% were from pediatric intensive care units, and 9% were from other hospital wards. The mean time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 3.3 days (95% CI, 3.2-3.5 days) and the median time was 3 days (range, 2-7 days). The mean time from hospital admission to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 17.5 days (95% CI, 14.6-21.1 days) and 93 reports (86%) were issued prior to death or hospital discharge. A molecular diagnosis was established in 55 patients (51%). Eleven diagnoses (20%) resulted from using the following approaches to augment standard exome sequencing analysis: mitochondrial genome sequencing analysis, exome sequencing-based copy number analysis, use of international databases to identify novel gene-disease associations, and additional phenotyping and RNA analysis. In 42 of 55 patients (76%) with a molecular diagnosis and 6 of 53 patients (11%) without a molecular diagnosis, the ultra-rapid exome sequencing result was considered as having influenced clinical management.

Meanwhile, unfortunately, the specific biomarkers for the early and timely diagnosis of sepsis in infants and for the determination of the severity of this disease are lacking in clinical practice. METHODS: Samples from 18 sepsis infants with comorbidities, 25 sepsis infants without comorbidities, and 25 infants with noninfectious diseases were evaluated using a serum metabolomics approach based on liquid chromatography‒mass spectrometry (LC‒MS) technology. Differentially abundant metabolites were screened via multivariate statistical analysis. In addition, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) analyses were conducted to identify the key metabolites in infants with sepsis and without infections. The random forest algorithm was applied to determine key differentially abundant metabolites between sepsis infants with and without comorbidities. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for biomarker value testing. Finally, a metabolic pathway analysis was conducted to explore the metabolic and signaling pathways associated with the identified differentially abundant metabolites. RESULTS: A total of 189 metabolites exhibited significant differences between infectious infants and noninfectious infants, while 137 distinct metabolites exhibited differences between septic infants with and without comorbidities. After screening for the key differentially abundant metabolites using LASSO and SVM-RFE analyses, hexylamine, psychosine sulfate, LysoPC (18:1 (9Z)/0:0), 2,4,6-tribromophenol, and 25-cinnamoyl-vulgaroside were retained for the diagnosis of infant sepsis. ROC curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.9200 for hexylamine, 0.9749 for psychosine sulfate, 0.9684 for LysoPC (18:1 (9Z)/0:0), 0.7405 for 2,4,6-tribromophenol, 0.8893 for 25-cinnamoyl-vulgaroside, and 1.000 for the combination of all metabolites. When the septic infants with comorbidities were compared to those without comorbidities, four endogenous metabolites with the greatest importance were identified using the random forest algorithm, namely, 12-oxo-20-trihydroxy-leukotriene B4, dihydrovaltrate, PA (8:0/12:0), and 2-heptanethiol. The ROC curve analysis of these four key differentially abundant metabolites revealed that the AUC was 1 for all four metabolites. Pathway analysis indicated that phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and porphyrin metabolism play important roles in infant sepsis.

Proportions of late and early onset were 25 (83.3%) and 5(17.7%) respectively.In blood culture Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism(80%),followed by Coagulase negative Staphylococcus (6.66%), Acinetobacter (6.66%), Enterobacter species(3.33%) and Morgonellamorgoni (3.33.5%).Gram positive organisms were isolated in all cases of early onset sepsis and in 84% of late onset sepsis. Most of the isolated organisms showed sensitivity to amikacin, cloxacillin, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS: This study has indicated possible emergence of Staphylococcus aureus as the dominant cause of neonatal sepsis. Cloxacillin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin have high proportion of efficacy against the commonly isolated bacteria in neonatal sepsis.", "pub_date": "2015-01-01", "authors": ["R H Chapagain", "R Acharya", "N Shrestha", "B R Giri", "B B Bagale", "M Kayastha"], "journal": "Journal of Nepal Health Research Council", "doi": "", "source": "pubmed"}

A high prevalence of morbidity and comorbidity is associated with dysthymia: major depression, alcoholism, anxiety and personality disorders are present in the vast majority of sufferers. It is also very unusual for people with dysthymia to not develop superimposed episodes of major depressive disorder, resulting in a longer time to recover and high rates of recurrence and chronicity. Approximately 3.1% of the population have dysthymia including children and adolescents who, like adults, exhibit a higher risk for new episodes of depressive illness if they have this disorder. Children and adolescents with depressive illnesses have higher rates of scholastic failure and school-related problems. Dysthymia can affect every aspect of a person's quality of life including relationships with significant others, earning potential and, most importantly, mental and physical well-being.

Biomarkers characterising the dysregulated host response in sepsis are lacking. We aimed to develop host gene expression signatures to predict organ dysfunction in children with bacterial or viral infection. METHODS: This cohort study was done in emergency departments and intensive care units of four hospitals in Queensland, Australia, and recruited children aged 1 month to 17 years who, upon admission, underwent a diagnostic test, including blood cultures, for suspected sepsis. Whole-blood RNA sequencing of blood was performed with Illumina NovaSeq (San Diego, CA, USA). Samples with completed phenotyping, monitoring, and RNA extraction by March 31, 2020, were included in the discovery cohort; samples collected or completed thereafter and by Oct 27, 2021, constituted the Rapid Paediatric Infection Diagnosis in Sepsis (RAPIDS) internal validation cohort. An external validation cohort was assembled from RNA sequencing gene expression count data from the observational European Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS), which recruited children with severe infection in nine European countries between 2012 and 2016. Feature selection approaches were applied to derive novel gene signatures for disease class (bacterial vs viral infection) and disease severity (presence vs absence of organ dysfunction 24 h post-sampling). The primary endpoint was the presence of organ dysfunction 24 h after blood sampling in the presence of confirmed bacterial versus viral infection. Gene signature performance is reported as area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 95% CI. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2017, and Oct 27, 2021, 907 patients were enrolled. Blood samples from 595 patients were included in the discovery cohort, and samples from 312 children were included in the RAPIDS validation cohort. We derived a ten-gene disease class signature that achieved an AUC of 94·1% (95% CI 90·6-97·7) in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in the RAPIDS validation cohort. A ten-gene disease severity signature achieved an AUC of 82·2% (95% CI 76·3-88·1) in predicting organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling in the RAPIDS validation cohort. Used in tandem, the disease class and disease severity signatures predicted organ dysfunction within 24 h of sampling with an AUC of 90·5% (95% CI 83·3-97·6) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 94·7% (87·8-100·0) for patients with predicted viral infection. In the external EUCLIDS validation dataset (n=362), the disease class and disease severity predicted organ dysfunction at time of sampling with an AUC of 70·1% (95% CI 44·1-96·2) for patients with predicted bacterial infection and 69·6% (53·1-86·0) for patients with predicted viral infection. INTERPRETATION: In children evaluated for sepsis, novel host transcriptomic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infection can identify dysregulated host response leading to organ dysfunction.

Median overall survival is only one year. Currently, the scientific focus is on expanding the knowledge base of the molecular biology of DIPG, and identifying effective therapies. Oncolytic adenovirus DNX-2401 is a replication-competent, genetically modified virus capable of infecting and killing glioma cells, and stimulating an anti-tumor immune response. Clinical trials evaluating intratumoral DNX-2401 in adults with recurrent glioblastoma have demonstrated that the virus has a favorable safety profile and can prolong survival. Subsequently, these results have encouraged the transition of this biologically active therapy from adults into the pediatric population. To this aim, we have designed a clinical Phase I trial for newly diagnosed pediatric DIPG to investigate the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of delivering DNX-2401 into tumors within the pons following biopsy. This case report presents a pediatric patient enrolled in this ongoing Phase I trial for children and adolescents with newly diagnosed DIPG. The case involves an 8-year-old female patient with radiologically diagnosed DIPG who underwent stereotactic tumor biopsy immediately followed by intratumoral DNX-2401 in the same biopsy track. Because there were no safety concerns or new neurological deficits, the patient was discharged 3 days after the procedures.

The results revealed that, with the exception of Eu, concentrations of the REEs in hair were higher in the cases than in the controls. The univariate odds ratios (ORs) of the 14 REEs were >1, and four of the REEs (Dy, Tm, Yb, and Y) also had adjusted ORs > 1. The increasing dose-response trends of the four REEs further indicated the potential for increased hypertension risk. Moreover, the REEs were negatively correlated with Ca content in hair.

Several brainstem-regulated physiological processes undergo disruption during neonatal sepsis. Mechanistic knowledge gaps exist at the interplay between metabolism and immune activation to brainstem neural circuits and pertinent physiological functions in neonates. To delineate this association, we induced systemic inflammation either by TLR4 (LPS) or TLR1/2 (PAM3CSK4) ligand administration in postnatal day 5 mice (PD5). Our findings show that LPS and PAM3CSK4 evoke substantial changes in respiration and metabolism. Physiological trade-offs led to hypometabolic-hypothermic responses due to LPS, but not PAM3CSK4, whereas to both TLR ligands blunted respiratory chemoreflexes. Neuroinflammatory pathways modulation in brainstem showed more robust effects in LPS than PAM3CSK4. Brainstem neurons, microglia, and astrocyte gene expression analyses showed unique responses to TLR ligands. PAM3CSK4 did not significantly modulate gene expression changes in GLAST-1 positive brainstem astrocytes. PD5 pups receiving PAM3CSK4 failed to maintain a prolonged metabolic state repression, which correlated to enhanced gasping latency and impaired autoresuscitation during anoxic chemoreflex challenges. In contrast, LPS administered pups showed no significant changes in anoxic chemoreflex. Electrophysiological studies from brainstem slices prepared from pups exposed to either TLR4 or PAM3CSK4 showed compromised transmission between preBötzinger complex and Hypoglossal as an exclusive response to the TLR1/2 ligand. Spatial gene expression analysis demonstrated a region-specific modulation of PAM3CSK4 within the raphe nucleus relative to other anatomical sites evaluated.

Given the widespread usage of these medicines, even a small increase in psychiatric risk could be of clinical significance. Although mood-related side effects are a common reason for OC hesitancy and discontinuation, studies investigating psychiatric responses to OC treatment have had inconsistent results. SUMMARY: While OCs are beneficial for most users, there is evidence that a subgroup of users is susceptible to mood side effects. Randomized controlled trials have generally failed to find differences in mood symptoms between OC and placebo users, but observational studies comparing OC users to non-users have reported increases in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. Additionally, observational evidence suggests that OC users may be more likely to use prescription psychotropic medications and to attempt or die by suicide. However, responses to OC treatment are highly heterogeneous, and some users report mood improvement. A variety of factors may increase the likelihood of negative psychiatric side effects, including younger age, previous experience of side effects from OCs, and preexisting psychiatric disorders. Progestin-only pills may confer a higher psychiatric risk than combination pills. KEY MESSAGES: Further research investigating factors that contribute to susceptibility to the mood-related side effects of OCs is clearly warranted. Genomic approaches may provide insight as to why some users experience side effects while others do not.

Promising pre-clinical and clinical data of CAR T-cell activity have emerged from targeting surface antigens such as GD2 and B7H3 in childhood cancer neuroblastoma. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is expressed in a majority of neuroblastomas at low antigen density but is largely absent from healthy tissues. METHODS: To explore an alternate target antigen for neuroblastoma CAR T-cell therapy, the authors generated and screened a single-chain variable fragment library targeting ALK extracellular domain to make a panel of new anti-ALK CAR T-cell constructs. RESULTS: A lead novel CAR T-cell construct was capable of specific cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma cells expressing low levels of ALK, but with only weak cytokine and proliferative T-cell responses. To explore strategies for amplifying ALK CAR T cells, the authors generated a co-CAR approach in which T cells received signal 1 from a first-generation ALK construct and signal 2 from anti-B7H3 or GD2 chimeric co-stimulatory receptors. The co-CAR approach successfully demonstrated the ability to avoid targeting single-antigen-positive targets as a strategy for mitigating on-target off-tumor toxicity.

Although there is uncertainty around causality, cannabis use may be one of a few modifiable risk factors for conversion to psychotic disorders in individuals with Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P) syndromes, characterized by functionally impairing and distressing subthreshold psychotic symptoms. To date, few recommendations beyond abstinence to reduce adverse psychiatric events associated with cannabis use have been made. This narrative review synthesizes existing scientific literature on cannabis' acute psychotomimetic effects and epidemiological associations with psychotic disorders in both CHR-P and healthy individuals to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and practical mental health intervention. There is compelling evidence for cannabis acutely exacerbating psychotic symptoms in CHR-P, but its impact on conversion to psychotic disorder is unclear. Current evidence supports a harm reduction approach in reducing frequency of acute psychotic-like experiences, though whether such interventions decrease CHR-P individuals' risk of conversion to psychotic disorder remains unknown. Specific recommendations include reducing frequency of use, lowering delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol content in favor of cannabidiol-only products, avoiding products with inconsistent potency like edibles, enhancing patient-provider communication about cannabis use and psychotic-like experiences, and utilizing a collaborative and individualized therapeutic approach.

We show that DDR1 nuclear translocation requires collagen-mediated receptor activation and interaction of DDR1 with SEC61B, a component of the Sec61 translocon, and nonmuscle myosin IIA and  CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a novel mechanism whereby activated DDR1 translates to the nucleus to regulate synthesis of profibrotic molecules.", "pub_date": "2019-08-05", "authors": ["Manuel Chiusa", "Wen Hu", "Hong-Jun Liao", "Yan Su", "Corina M Borza", "Mark P de Caestecker", "Nataliya I Skrypnyk", "Agnes B Fogo", "Vadim Pedchenko", "Xiyue Li", "Ming-Zhi Zhang", "Billy G Hudson", "Trayambak Basak", "Roberto M Vanacore", "Roy Zent", "Ambra Pozzi"], "journal": "Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN", "doi": "10.1681/ASN.2018111160", "source": "pubmed"}

METHODS: Descriptive retrospective study of children under 14 years of age diagnosed with IBIs in a PED of a tertiary hospital between January 2008 and December 2009. RESULTS: In this period we registered 123 396 episodes and 59 patients who were diagnosed with IBIs (22 patients under 1 year of age, 37.2%). Of these, 11 (18.6%) had some severe underlying condition and 38 (64.4%) were stable on arrival. The most common diagnoses were sepsis with/without meningitis (23, 38.9%) and bacteraemia (14, 23.7%), while the pathogens most frequently isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (23, 38.9%) and Neisseria meningitidis (18, 30.5%). Pathogens were isolated from blood in 57 patients and from the cerebrospinal fluid in eight (in these, the same bacterial species was isolated in the blood, except for two cases with S. pneumoniae). Of the pneumococci isolated, 80% corresponded to serotypes included in the 13-valent PCV13. In seven cases, pathogens were detected using only PCR analysis (N. meningitidis, four; S. pneumoniae, three). Twenty-five patients were admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit.

The main objective is to characterize the emergency presentation of the IBI among children aged younger than 14 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective registry-based cohort study including all patients aged younger than 14 years diagnosed with confirmed IBI (culture or genomic detection using the polymerase chain reaction) was carried out in a paediatric emergency department between 2008 and 2015. Severity criteria were as follows: death, sequelae or admission to the ICU. RESULTS: Of the 223 IBIs reported, 187 (83.9%) corresponded to previously healthy patients (median age=19 months) and 165 (74%) were well appearing. The most common diagnoses were occult bacteraemia [60 (26.9%)] and sepsis [56 (25.1%)]. The most frequent pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae [68 (30.5%)] and Neisseria meningitidis [42 (18.8%)]. Four (1.8) patients died (S. pneumoniae, 2) and eight (3.5%) had sequelae (S. pneumoniae, 5). The diagnoses and clinical characteristics of the children varied significantly depending on the isolated pathogen.

We sought to describe the prevalence of four pathogens that are not part of routine empiric coverage (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium difficile, and fungal infections) in pediatric sepsis patients in a contemporary nationally representative sample. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study using administrative data. SETTING: We used the Nationwide Readmissions Database from 2014, which is a nationally representative dataset that contains data from nearly half of all discharges from nonfederal hospitals in the United States. PATIENTS: Discharges of patients who were less than 19 years old at discharge and were not neonatal with a discharge diagnosis of sepsis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 19,113 pediatric admissions with sepsis (6,300 [33%] previously healthy and 12,813 [67%] with a chronic disease), 31% received mechanical ventilation, 19% had shock, and 588 (3.1%) died during their hospitalization. Among all admissions, 8,204 (42.9%) had a bacterial or fungal pathogen identified. S. aureus was the most common pathogen identified in previously healthy patients (n = 593, 9.4%) and those with any chronic disease (n = 1,430, 11.1%). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, C. difficile, and fungal infections all had high prevalence in specific chronic diseases associated with frequent contact with the healthcare system, early surgery, indwelling devices, or immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationally representative administrative database, the most common identified pathogen was S. aureus in previously healthy and chronically ill children. In addition, a high proportion of children with sepsis and select chronic diseases had infections with methicillin-resistant S. aureus, fungal infections, Pseudomonas infections, and C. difficile.

Vorasidenib, an oral brain-penetrant inhibitor of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 enzymes, showed preliminary activity in IDH-mutant gliomas. METHODS: In a double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with residual or recurrent grade 2 IDH-mutant glioma who had undergone no previous treatment other than surgery to receive either oral vorasidenib (40 mg once daily) or matched placebo in 28-day cycles. The primary end point was imaging-based progression-free survival according to blinded assessment by an independent review committee. The key secondary end point was the time to the next anticancer intervention. Crossover to vorasidenib from placebo was permitted on confirmation of imaging-based disease progression. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 331 patients were assigned to receive vorasidenib (168 patients) or placebo (163 patients). At a median follow-up of 14.2 months, 226 patients (68.3%) were continuing to receive vorasidenib or placebo. Progression-free survival was significantly improved in the vorasidenib group as compared with the placebo group (median progression-free survival, 27.7 months vs. 11.1 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27 to 0.56; P<0.001). The time to the next intervention was significantly improved in the vorasidenib group as compared with the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.43; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 22.8% of the patients who received vorasidenib and in 13.5% of those who received placebo. An increased alanine aminotransferase level of grade 3 or higher occurred in 9.6% of the patients who received vorasidenib and in no patients who received placebo.

The use of these three procedures to diagnose comorbid learning problems produced significantly different results. All methods identified significant numbers of children in the clinical population as learning disabled; however, each method identified children with differing characteristics. Consistent with predictions from measurement theory, the commonly used simple standard score discrepancy method was more likely to identify children with above-average IQs as learning disabled, whereas a regression approach identified learning disabilities more consistently across the ability range.

In contrast to sepsis definition in adults and children, clinical and laboratory criteria for defining neonatal sepsis have been inconclusive. More recently, studies have attempted to better understand the clinical progression of neonatal sepsis and associated mortality. This data has guided the development of a neonatal SOFA (nSOFA) score, based on common patterns of organ dysfunction observed in this population. RECENT FINDINGS: Although SOFA scores in the adult and pediatric populations have their limitations with moderate sensitivities and specificities depending on the clinical setting, the nSOFA score has been validated in predicting sepsis attributable mortality in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants across several patient cohorts. Furthermore, the nSOFA score has been adapted for use in neonatal disease states, other than sepsis, with similar prognostic utility. SUMMARY: Utilizing an nSOFA scoring system for prediction of sepsis attributable mortality in preterm infants allows for targeted interventions based on risk stratification, as well as better delineation of neonatal sepsis with subsequent improvements in research and patient safety outcomes.", "pub_date": "2022-11-29", "authors": ["Noa Fleiss", "Richard A Polin"], "journal": "Current opinion in pediatrics", "doi": "10.1097/MOP.0000000000001207", "source": "pubmed"}

Cord blood vitamin D has been suggested to modify or mediate the effects of environmental exposures. However, none has investigated these roles of cord blood vitamin D in the associations of prenatal exposure to REEs with fetal growth. Maternal trimester-specific urinary concentrations of 13 REEs, cord blood total 25-hydroxyvitamin D at delivery, and birth weight (BW)-for-gestational age (GA) were determined in 710 mother-newborn pairs from Wuhan, China. Higher maternal average urinary concentrations of europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), dysprosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), and ytterbium (Yb) across three trimesters, either individually or jointly, were significantly associated with lower BW-for-GA Z-scores and higher odds of small for gestational age (SGA) [β = -0.092; 95 % confidence interval (CI): -0.149, -0.035 for BW-for-GA Z-scores, and odds ratio = 1.60; 95 % CI: 1.14, 2.24 for SGA involved in each unit increase in weighted quantile sum index of REEs mixture].

The mediation analyses taking account of exposure-mediator interaction showed that the relationships between REEs (as individual and mixture) exposure and lower BW-for-GA were partly mediated through decreasing cord blood vitamin D levels. The proportions mediated by cord blood vitamin D levels were 24.48 % for BW-for-GA Z-scores and 29.05 % for SGA corresponding to the REEs mixture exposure. Conclusively, our study revealed that prenatal exposures to Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, and Yb were related to fetal growth restriction.

Participants were older than 56 days and younger than 18 years, had suspected sepsis, and had not received broad-spectrum antibiotics in the previous 4 hours. Primary outcome was source pathogen, defined as confirmed bacterial source from sterile body fluid or confirmed viral source. Secondary outcome was sepsis severity, defined as maximum therapy required for shock reversal in the first 3 hospital days.

RESULTS: We collected ribonucleic acid samples from a convenience sample of 122 children with suspected sepsis and 12 healthy controls. We compared the 66 children (54%) with confirmed bacterial or viral infection and found 558 differentially expressed genes, many related to interferon signaling or viral immunity.

On the other hand, air pollution may be associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Unlike other environmental causes of cancer (e.g., irradiation), air pollution cannot efficiently be controlled by geographical borders, regulations, and policies. The unavoidable exposure to air pollution can modify cancer incidence and mortality. GBM treatment with chemotherapy or even its surgical removal has proven insufficient (100% recurrence rate; patient's survival mean of 15 months; 90% fatality within five years) due to glioma infiltrative and migratory capacities. Given the barrage of attention and research investments currently plowed into next-generation cancer therapy, oncolytic viruses are perhaps the most vigorously pursued. Provision of an insight into the current state of the research and future direction is essential for stimulating new ideas with the potentials of filling research gaps. This review manuscript aims to overview types of brain cancer, their burden, and different causative agents. It also describes why air pollution is becoming a concerning factor. The different opinions on the association of air pollution with brain cancer are reviewed. It tries to address the significant controversy in this field by hypothesizing the air-pollution-brain-cancer association via inflammation and atopic conditions. The last section of this review deals with the oncolytic viruses, which have been used in, or are still under clinical trials for GBM treatment. Engineered adenoviruses (i.e., DNX-2401, DNX-2440, CRAd8-S-pk7 loaded Neural stem cells), herpes simplex virus type 1 (i.e., HSV-1 C134, HSV-1 rQNestin34.5v.2, HSV-1 G207, HSV-1 M032), measles virus (i.e., MV-CEA), parvovirus (i.e., ParvOryx), poliovirus (i.e., Poliovirus PVSRIPO), reovirus (i.e., pelareorep), moloney murine leukemia virus (i.e., Toca 511 vector), and vaccinia virus (i.e., vaccinia virus TG6002) as possible life-changing alleviations for GBM have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first review that comprehensively discusses both (i) the negative/positive association of air pollution with GBM; and (ii) the application of oncolytic viruses for GBM, including the most recent advances and clinical trials. It is also the first review that addresses the controversies over air pollution and brain cancer association. We believe that the article will significantly appeal to a broad readership of virologists, oncologists, neurologists, environmentalists, and those who work in the field of (bio)energy. Policymakers may also use it to establish better health policies and regulations about air pollution and (bio)fuels exploration, production, and consumption.", "pub_date": "2021-05-15", "authors": ["Hamed Kazemi Shariat Panahi", "Mona Dehhaghi", "Su Shiung Lam", "Wanxi Peng", "Mortaza Aghbashlo", "Meisam Tabatabaei", "Gilles J Guillemin"], "journal": "Seminars in cancer biology", "doi": "10.1016/j.semcancer.2021.05.013", "source": "pubmed"}

Despite having potentially life-threatening toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, the benefits of CAR T-cell therapy far outweigh these risks, particularly as increased experience and improved supportive care measures are mitigating these toxicities. CAR T cells can result in complete remission for significant proportion of patients with relapsed and refractory B-ALL and permit them to proceed to potentially curative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). CAR T cells may also be curative by themselves. Herein lie the greatest challenges and questions for clinical investigators, specifically, how are CAR T cells best employed and how do we overcome mechanisms of resistance to them? The primary clinical question is the timing and even the necessity of allo-HSCT. Relative to resistance, we know that target antigen loss, specifically CD19, is a major contributor to resistance. However, current investigations of alternative targets, such CD22, and CAR T cells expressing dual targeting antigen receptors have demonstrated encouraging initial results and provide a high degree of optimism that the efficacy and the broader application of CAR T-cell therapy will gradually increase in B-ALL. That optimism is not as high and the challenges are increased for the application of CAR T cells in T-cell leukemias and acute myeloid leukemia due to the relative lack of suitable leukemia surface targets that are not also expressed on normal hematopoietic progenitors. Despite these significant challenges, considerable research is being conducted into the development of CAR T cells for these diseases utilizing unique technologies, which may be applicable to other diseases.", "pub_date": "2021-06-07", "authors": ["Katherine Harris", "James L LaBelle", "Michael R Bishop"], "journal": "Current treatment options in oncology", "doi": "10.1007/s11864-021-00859-8", "source": "pubmed"}

Consequently, within the VII Framework Programme, the European Commission funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in eleven European countries, with Sweden as the coordinating centre, and was designed to identify an effective way to promote mental health and reduce suicidality and risk taking behaviours among adolescents. OBJECTIVE: To describe the methodological and field procedures in the SEYLE RCT among adolescents, as well as to present the main characteristics of the recruited sample. METHODS: Analyses were conducted to determine: 1) representativeness of study sites compared to respective national data; 2) response rate of schools and pupils, drop-out rates from baseline to 3 and 12 month follow-up, 3) comparability of samples among the four Intervention Arms; 4) properties of the standard scales employed: Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), World Health Organization Well-Being Scale (WHO-5). RESULTS: Participants at baseline comprised 12,395 adolescents (M/F: 5,529/6,799; mean age=14.9±0.9) from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. At the 3 and 12 months follow up, participation rates were 87.3% and 79.4%, respectively. Demographic characteristics of participating sites were found to be reasonably representative of their respective national population. Overall response rate of schools was 67.8%. All scales utilised in the study had good to very good internal reliability, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (BDI-II: 0.864; Z-SAS: 0.805; SDQ: 0.740; WHO-5: 0.799). CONCLUSIONS: SEYLE achieved its objective of recruiting a large representative sample of adolescents within participating European countries. Analysis of SEYLE data will shed light on the effectiveness of important interventions aimed at improving adolescent mental health and well-being, reducing risk-taking and self-destructive behaviour and preventing suicidality.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate memory complaints, a mental status test, and several cognitive tests as dementia screens in primary care. DESIGN: Cross-sectional clinical epidemiologic study. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred thirty-nine comprehensively assessed, primary care patients aged > or = 65 years. MEASUREMENTS: Memory complaints were abstracted from chart review. Scores on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and domain-specific cognitive testing were compared to a dementia diagnosis based on Clinical Dementia Rating score > or = 1, and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated. Classification and regression tree analyses were performed on memory complaints and tests with the highest AUCs. RESULTS: Of 33 patients with dementia, only 5 had documented memory complaints. In 25 patients with documented memory complaints, no cognitive tests further improved identification of the 5 with dementia. In 28 patients with dementia but without memory complaints, an MMSE score < 20 identified 8 cases; among those with MMSE scores 20-21, a visual memory test identified a further 11 cases. Further cognitive testing could not detect 9 dementia cases without memory complaints and with MMSE scores > or = 22. CONCLUSIONS: In older primary care patients with memory complaints, cognitive screening does not help identify those who require further examination for dementia. Most patients with dementia do not report memory complaints. In these asymptomatic individuals, general mental status testing, supplemented by a memory test when the mental status score is equivocal, will identify lower-scoring patients who need dementia assessment.

For clinical trials, individual patient management, and quality improvement efforts, it is unclear which patients are least likely to survive and thus benefit from alternative treatment approaches. A robust risk stratification tool would greatly aid decision-making. The objective of our study was to derive and test a multi-biomarker-based risk model to predict outcome in pediatric septic shock. METHODS: Twelve candidate serum protein stratification biomarkers were identified from previous genome-wide expression profiling. To derive the risk stratification tool, biomarkers were measured in serum samples from 220 unselected children with septic shock, obtained during the first 24 hours of admission to the intensive care unit. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to generate a decision tree to predict 28-day all-cause mortality based on both biomarkers and clinical variables. The derived tree was subsequently tested in an independent cohort of 135 children with septic shock. RESULTS: The derived decision tree included five biomarkers. In the derivation cohort, sensitivity for mortality was 91% (95% CI 70 - 98), specificity was 86% (80 - 90), positive predictive value was 43% (29 - 58), and negative predictive value was 99% (95 - 100). When applied to the test cohort, sensitivity was 89% (64 - 98) and specificity was 64% (55 - 73). In an updated model including all 355 subjects in the combined derivation and test cohorts, sensitivity for mortality was 93% (79 - 98), specificity was 74% (69 - 79), positive predictive value was 32% (24 - 41), and negative predictive value was 99% (96 - 100). False positive subjects in the updated model had greater illness severity compared to the true negative subjects, as measured by persistence of organ failure, length of stay, and intensive care unit free days. CONCLUSIONS: The pediatric sepsis biomarker risk model (PERSEVERE; PEdiatRic SEpsis biomarkEr Risk modEl) reliably identifies children at risk of death and greater illness severity from pediatric septic shock.

To test whether progestagen and androgen delivery systems designed to produce steady serum levels will be as effective as other androgen plus progestagen combinations, we compared Norplant II and testosterone (T) transdermal patch to T patch alone on the suppression of spermatogenesis in normal men. Thirty-nine healthy male volunteers (age, 20-45 yr) were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 (n = 19) received two transdermal T patches daily (Testoderm TTS, each patch designed to deliver about 5 mg/d T) alone, and group 2 (n = 20) received combined Norplant II [Jadelle, four capsules delivering approximately 160 microg/d levonorgestrel (LNG)] plus T patch. Neither of these regimens were very effective, with suppression of spermatogenesis to severe oligozoospermia occurring in less than 60% of subjects. We then expanded the study to include two more groups to determine whether T patch or Norplant II was the main factor causing the inadequate suppression of spermatogenesis. Another 29 subjects were randomized to one of two groups. Group 3 (n = 15) received oral LNG (125 microg/d) plus T patch, and group 4 (n = 14) received Norplant II plus T enanthate (TE) injection (100 mg/wk i.m.). After a pretreatment phase of 4 wk, all subjects received treatment for 24 wk, followed by a recovery period of 12-24 wk. Steady-state serum LNG levels (800-1200 pmol/liter) were achieved from wk 3-24 after Norplant II insertion and decreased rapidly after the removal of the implants at wk 24. Trough serum LNG levels after oral LNG administration were at a comparable range (940-1300 pmol/liter). Azoospermia was achieved in 24%, 35%, 33%, and 93%, and severe oligozoospermia (<1 x 10(6)/ml) developed in 24%, 60%, 42%, and 100% of the subjects in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, during treatment phase. All subjects in the Norplant II plus TE groups had persistent sperm concentrations less than 3 x 10(6)/ml from wk 12 until the end of treatment. Concomitant with the marked suppression of spermatogenesis in the Norplant II plus TE group, serum FSH and LH levels were most decreased in this group compared with all other groups. In the T patch-only group, serum SHBG was not suppressed, and total serum T was higher than baseline levels. In the other three groups administered progestagens, serum SHBGs were significantly suppressed, and serum total T remained similar to baseline levels. Serum free T levels were not changed in any group. Except for a suppression of serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, there was no significant change in weight, hematocrit, clinical chemistry, or prostate-specific antigen levels in any of the treatment groups. Although more efficacious than T patch alone, Norplant II or oral LNG plus T patch was not as effective in suppressing spermatogenesis to severe oligo- or azoospermia as in previous reports using oral LNG plus TE. This relative lesser efficacy occurred despite the achievement of serum LNG levels by Norplant II that were equivalent to those reported after administration of oral LNG. Substituting the transdermal T delivery system with TE injections resulted in very effective suppression of sperm output. The difference in spermatogenesis suppression of these combined regimens is likely due to less T delivered by the transdermal patch compared with the TE weekly injections. We conclude that Norplant II implants plus TE 100 mg/wk were very efficient in suppressing spermatogenesis to a level acceptable for contraceptive efficacy. This study demonstrates that the dose or route of administration of androgens is critical for sperm suppression in combined androgen-progestagen regimens for hormonal male contraception.", "pub_date": "2002-08-01", "authors": ["I T Gaw Gonzalo", "R S Swerdloff", "A L Nelson", "B Clevenger", "R Garcia", "N Berman", "C Wang"], "journal": "The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism", "doi": "10.1210/jcem.87.8.8710", "source": "pubmed"}

To assess the effectiveness and safety of lecanemab in treating AD, we thoroughly examined the studies that are currently accessible. METHOD: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations were followed. In order to find relevant studies on lecanemab, we carried out a thorough literature search utilizing the electronic databases MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, and Scopus. Excluding any research using experimental animals, we looked at lecanemab's effectiveness and side effects in treating AD in human clinical trials. Three randomized controlled studies were included. FINDINGS: According to studies, lecanemab lessens clinical deterioration and reduces brain amyloid-beta plaques (difference,.45; 95% confidence interval,.67 to.23; p < .001). Participants who received lecanemab saw a greater frequency of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA)-H (17.3% vs. 9.0%) and ARIA-E (12.6% vs. 1.7%), which is a significant adverse outcome.

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) typically tests hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and offers opportunity to evaluate aggregated effects of many genetic variants with effects that are too small to detect individually. The gene-set-enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a pathway-based approach that tests for such aggregated effects of genes that are linked by biological functions. A key step in GSEA is the summary statistic (gene score) used to measure the overall relevance of a gene based on all SNPs tested in the gene. Existing GSEA methods use maximum statistics sensitive to gene size and linkage equilibrium. We propose the approach of variable set enrichment analysis (VSEA) and study new gene score methods that are less dependent on gene size. The new method treats groups of variables (SNPs or other variants) as base units for summarizing gene scores and relies less on gene definition itself. The power of VSEA is analyzed by simulation studies modeling various scenarios of complex multiloci interactions. Results show that the new gene scores generally performed better, some substantially so, than existing GSEA extension to GWAS.

Madrid study on dual pathology prevalence.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Cannabis use has been associated to a wide variety of mental disorders, the possible causal role of this use in the etiology of severe mental disorders as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder standing out. Moreover, the cannabinoid system is involved in emotional regulation, so cannabis use could disturb this process and provoke anxiety and mood disorders. The main objective of this study was to analyze the cannabis addict subgroup from Madrid study of prevalence of dual disorders in community mental health and substance misuse services. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 837 outpatients under treatment in the mental health network or drug network of the Community of Madrid (Spain). Of these, 353 subjects had a lifetime diagnosis of cannabis abuse or dependence and 357 subjects did not have cannabis substance use disorder. We used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to evaluate axis I mental disorders, and Personality Disorder Questionnaire to evaluate personality disorders. RESULTS: It was considered that 76.5% of the cannabis addicts had a current dual disorder. The most prevalent ones were mood and anxiety disorders. Of those addicted to cannabis, 51% had a personality disorder. Most of them had several substance use disorders. Cannabis abuse or dependence subjects had an earlier onset in consumption of other drugs such as alcohol, cocaine, and tobacco than addicts without cannabis abuse or dependence. The cannabis addicts also differed from the other addicts because of an association to antisocial personality disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis and agoraphobia.

Cinpanemab, a human-derived monoclonal antibody that binds to α-synuclein, is being evaluated as a disease-modifying treatment for Parkinson's disease. METHODS: In a 52-week, multicenter, double-blind, phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 2:1:2:2 ratio, participants with early Parkinson's disease to receive intravenous infusions of placebo (control) or cinpanemab at a dose of 250 mg, 1250 mg, or 3500 mg every 4 weeks, followed by an active-treatment dose-blinded extension period for up to 112 weeks. The primary end points were the changes from baseline in the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) total score (range, 0 to 236, with higher scores indicating worse performance) at weeks 52 and 72. Secondary end points included MDS-UPDRS subscale scores and striatal binding as assessed on dopamine transporter single-photon-emission computed tomography (DaT-SPECT). RESULTS: Of the 357 enrolled participants, 100 were assigned to the control group, 55 to the 250-mg cinpanemab group, 102 to the 1250-mg group, and 100 to the 3500-mg group. The trial was stopped after the week 72 interim analysis owing to lack of efficacy. The change to week 52 in the MDS-UPDRS score was 10.8 points in the control group, 10.5 points in the 250-mg group, 11.3 points in the 1250-mg group, and 10.9 points in the 3500-mg group (adjusted mean difference vs. control, -0.3 points [95% confidence interval {CI}, -4.9 to 4.3], P = 0.90; 0.5 points [95% CI, -3.3 to 4.3], P = 0.80; and 0.1 point [95% CI, -3.8 to 4.0], P = 0.97, respectively). The adjusted mean difference at 72 weeks between participants who received cinpanemab through 72 weeks and the pooled group of those who started cinpanemab at 52 weeks was -0.9 points (95% CI, -5.6 to 3.8) for the 250-mg dose, 0.6 points (95% CI, -3.3 to 4.4) for the 1250-mg dose, and -0.8 points (95% CI, -4.6 to 3.0) for the 3500-mg dose. Results for secondary end points were similar to those for the primary end points. DaT-SPECT imaging at week 52 showed no differences between the control group and any cinpanemab group. The most common adverse events with cinpanemab were headache, nasopharyngitis, and falls. CONCLUSIONS: In participants with early Parkinson's disease, the effects of cinpanemab on clinical measures of disease progression and changes in DaT-SPECT imaging did not differ from those of placebo over a 52-week period.

The level of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a circulating cytokine, is elevated in cancer cachexia. In a small, open-label, phase 1b study involving patients with cancer cachexia, ponsegromab, a humanized monoclonal antibody inhibiting GDF-15, was associated with improved weight, appetite, and physical activity, along with suppressed serum GDF-15 levels. METHODS: In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, 12-week trial, we assigned patients with cancer cachexia and an elevated serum GDF-15 level (≥1500 pg per milliliter) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive ponsegromab at a dose of 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg or to receive placebo, administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for three doses. The primary end point was the change from baseline in body weight at 12 weeks. Key secondary end points were appetite and cachexia symptoms, digital measures of physical activity, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 187 patients underwent randomization. Of these patients, 40% had non-small-cell lung cancer, 32% had pancreatic cancer, and 29% had colorectal cancer. At 12 weeks, patients in the ponsegromab groups had significantly greater weight gain than those in the placebo group, with a median between-group difference of 1.22 kg (95% credible interval, 0.37 to 2.25) in the 100-mg group, 1.92 (95% credible interval, 0.92 to 2.97) in the 200-mg group, and 2.81 (95% credible interval, 1.55 to 4.08) in the 400-mg group. Improvements were observed across measures of appetite and cachexia symptoms, along with physical activity, in the 400-mg ponsegromab group relative to placebo. Adverse events of any cause were reported in 70% of the patients in the ponsegromab group and in 80% of those in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with cancer cachexia and elevated GDF-15 levels, the inhibition of GDF-15 with ponsegromab resulted in increased weight gain and overall activity level and reduced cachexia symptoms, findings that confirmed the role of GDF-15 as a driver of cachexia.

Due to the complex nature of LD and multiple disadvantages posed to the child due to LD, a multidisciplinary approach towards intervention is warranted. Given the paucity of evidence-based standardized treatment approaches, consensus guidelines for management of LD are needed. PROCESS: The meeting on formulation of national consensus guidelines on neurodevelopmental disorders was organized by Indian Academy of Pediatrics in Mumbai on 18th and 19th December, 2015. The invited experts included Pediatricians, Developmental Pediatricians, Pediatric Neurologists, Psychiatrists, Remedial Educators and Clinical Psychologists. The participants framed guidelines after extensive discussions. Thereafter, a committee was established to review and finalize the points discussed in the meeting. OBJECTIVE: To provide guidelines on evaluation and management of LD in children in India. RECOMMENDATIONS: A basic intervention approach should focus on: (i) interpretation of evaluation reports; (ii) description of specific skills that may be delayed (e.g., phoneme awareness and phonics; reading comprehension; spelling; number sense and organizational skills) and (iii) identification of co-morbidities. The intervention should be inter-disciplinary and individualized to each child.

Such correlations may reveal patterns of co-regulation that are indicative of biochemical pathways or common mechanisms of response to a related set of treatments. However, analyses of correlations are usually conducted by either subjective interpretation of the univariate covariance matrix or by applying multivariate modeling techniques, which do not take prior biological knowledge into account. Over-representation analysis (ORA) is a simple method for objectively deciding whether a set of variables of known or suspected biological relevance, such as a gene set or pathway, is more prevalent in a set of variables of interest than we expect by chance. However, ORA is usually applied to a set of variables differentiating a single experimental variable and does not take into account correlations. RESULTS: Over-representation of correlation analysis (ORCA) is a novel combination of ORA and correlation analysis that provides a means to test whether more associations exist between two specific groups of variables than expected by chance. The method is exemplified by application to drug sensitivity and microRNA expression data from a panel of cancer cell lines (NCI60). ORCA highlighted a previously reported correlation between sensitivity to alkylating anticancer agents and topoisomerase inhibitors. We also used this approach to validate microRNA clusters predicted by mRNA correlations. These observations suggest that ORCA has the potential to reveal novel insights from these data, which are not readily apparent using classical ORA.

It has been posited that characteristics of SMWGD's substance use companions (i.e., sexual orientation, gender identity) may influence their own use, but few studies have tested this. The current study aimed to examine whether quantity and consequences of substance use varied based on sexual orientations and gender identities (SOGI) of SMWGD's substance use companions. METHODS: We utilized a 30-day ecological momentary assessment study of substance use among a sample of 429 SMWGD. We examined event-level associations between characteristics of substance use companions and quantity and consequences of substance use. RESULTS: When SMWGD used alcohol/cannabis with most SOGI groups, they engaged in heavier drinking and cannabis use. Drinking with heterosexual men and SMW was associated with more drinking consequences. Drinking in settings with more SOGI groups and with both LGBTQ+ and heterosexual individuals was associated with heavier drinking and more consequences. Many contextual aspects of cannabis use settings predicted an increased likelihood of alcohol and cannabis co-use, while few contextual aspects of drinking settings were associated with co-use. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that SMWGD engage in heavier substance use when individuals from a range of SOGI groups are present, highlighting that heavy alcohol and cannabis use is not limited to use with SMW and nonbinary individuals.

The objective of this analysis is to report results from study 201 blinded period (core), the open-label extension (OLE), and gap period (between core and OLE) supporting the effectiveness of lecanemab. METHODS: The lecanemab study 201 core was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 856 patients randomized to one of five dose regimens or placebo. An OLE of study 201 was initiated to allow patients to receive open-label lecanemab 10mg/kg biweekly for up to 24 months, with an intervening off-treatment period (gap period) ranging from 9 to 59 months (mean 24 months). RESULTS: At 12 and 18 months of treatment in the core, lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly demonstrated dose-dependent reductions of brain amyloid measured PET and corresponding changes in plasma biomarkers and slowing of cognitive decline. The rates of clinical progression during the gap were similar in lecanemab and placebo subjects, with clinical treatment differences maintained after discontinued dosing over an average of 24 months in the gap period. During the gap, plasma Aβ42/40 ratio and p-tau181 levels began to return towards pre-randomization levels more quickly than amyloid PET. At OLE baseline, treatment differences vs placebo at 18 months in the randomized period were maintained across 3 clinical assessments. In the OLE, lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly treatment produced dose-dependent reductions in amyloid PET SUVr, improvements in plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, and reductions in plasma p-tau181. CONCLUSIONS: Lecanemab treatment resulted in significant reduction in amyloid plaques and a slowing of clinical decline. Data indicate that rapid and pronounced amyloid reduction correlates with clinical benefit and potential disease-modifying effects, as well as the potential to use plasma biomarkers to monitor for lecanemab treatment effects.

BAN2401-G000-201, a randomized double-blind clinical trial, utilized a Bayesian design with response-adaptive randomization to assess 3 doses across 2 regimens of lecanemab versus placebo in early Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild AD dementia. METHODS: BAN2401-G000-201 aimed to establish the effective dose 90% (ED90), defined as the simplest dose that achieves ≥90% of the maximum treatment effect. The primary endpoint was Bayesian analysis of 12-month clinical change on the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) for the ED90 dose, which required an 80% probability of ≥25% clinical reduction in decline versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints included 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses of brain amyloid reduction using positron emission tomography; clinical decline on ADCOMS, Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14); changes in CSF core biomarkers; and total hippocampal volume (HV) using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: A total of 854 randomized subjects were treated (lecanemab, 609; placebo, 245). At 12 months, the 10-mg/kg biweekly ED90 dose showed a 64% probability to be better than placebo by 25% on ADCOMS, which missed the 80% threshold for the primary outcome. At 18 months, 10-mg/kg biweekly lecanemab reduced brain amyloid (-0.306 SUVr units) while showing a drug-placebo difference in favor of active treatment by 27% and 30% on ADCOMS, 56% and 47% on ADAS-Cog14, and 33% and 26% on CDR-SB versus placebo according to Bayesian and frequentist analyses, respectively. CSF biomarkers were supportive of a treatment effect. Lecanemab was well-tolerated with 9.9% incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema/effusion at 10 mg/kg biweekly. CONCLUSIONS: BAN2401-G000-201 did not meet the 12-month primary endpoint. However, prespecified 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses demonstrated reduction in brain amyloid accompanied by a consistent reduction of clinical decline across several clinical and biomarker endpoints.

It is increasingly appreciated that metabolic pathways are not only crucial for nutrition but also play important roles in regulating inflammation and the host response to infection. Neonatal susceptibility to infection is increased due to a functionally distinct immune response characterized by high reliance on innate immune mechanisms. Interactions between metabolism and the immune response are increasingly recognized, as changes in metabolic pathways drive innate immune cell function and activation and consequently host response to pathogens. Moreover, metabolites, such as acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and succinate have immunoregulatory properties and serve as cofactors for enzymes involved in epigenetic reprogramming or \"training\" of innate immune cells after an initial infectious exposure. Highly sensitive metabolomic approaches allow us to define alterations in metabolic signatures as they change during ontogeny and as perturbed by immunization or infection, thereby linking metabolic pathways to immune cell effector functions.

Recently, Trofinetide was approved by the USFDA on 10 March 2023 as the first RTT treatment. This article underlines the pharmaceutical advancement, patent literature, and prospects of Trofinetide. The data for this study were gathered from the PubMed database, authentic websites (Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Neuren Pharmaceuticals, and USFDA), and free patent databases. Trofinetide was first disclosed by Neuren Pharmaceuticals in 2000 as a methyl group containing analog of the naturally occurring neuroprotective tripeptide called glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE). The joint efforts of Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Neuren Pharmaceuticals have developed Trofinetide. The mechanism of action of Trofinetide is not yet well established. However, it is supposed to improve neuronal morphology and synaptic functioning. The patent literature revealed a handful of inventions related to Trofinetide, providing excellent and unexplored broad research possibilities with Trofinetide. The development of innovative Trofinetide-based molecules, combinations of Trofinetide, patient-compliant drug formulations, and precise MECP2-mutation-related personalized medicines are foreseeable. Trofinetide is in clinical trials for some neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including treating Fragile X syndrome (FXS). It is expected that Trofinetide may be approved for treating FXS in the future.

Asundexian, an activated factor XI (XIa) inhibitor, is an oral anticoagulant that may prevent strokes with less bleeding. METHODS: In a phase 3, international, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation in a 1:1 ratio to receive asundexian at a dose of 50 mg once daily or standard-dose apixaban. The primary efficacy objective was to determine whether asundexian is at least noninferior to apixaban for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety objective was to determine whether asundexian is superior to apixaban with respect to major bleeding events. RESULTS: A total of 14,810 randomly assigned patients were included in the intention-to-treat population. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 73.9±7.7 years, 35.2% were women, 18.6% had chronic kidney disease, 18.2% had a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, 16.8% had received oral anticoagulants for no more than 6 weeks, and the mean CHA CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke, treatment with asundexian at a dose of 50 mg once daily was associated with a higher incidence of stroke or systemic embolism than treatment with apixaban in the period before the trial was stopped prematurely. There were fewer major bleeding events with asundexian than with apixaban during this time.

The incidence of bacterial sepsis during the neonatal period is high. Mannan-binding lectin (MBL), L-ficolin, and H-ficolin recognize microorganisms and activate the complement system via MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs). This study investigated whether cord blood concentrations of the lectin pathway proteins are associated with neonatal sepsis. METHODS. This was a case-control study including 47 infants with culture-proven sepsis during the first month of life and 94 matched controls. MBL, L-ficolin, H-ficolin, MASP-2, and MASP-3 levels were measured in cord blood with use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and time-resolved immunofluorometric assay. Multivariate logistic regression was performed. RESULTS. Infants with gram-positive sepsis had significantly lower H-ficolin cord blood concentrations than controls (multivariate odds ratio [OR], 4.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51-10.56; P = .005), whereas infants with gram-negative sepsis had lower MBL cord blood concentrations (OR, 2.99; 95% CI, 0.86-10.33; P = .084). When excluding patients with postoperative sepsis, multivariate analysis confirmed that low H-ficolin was associated with a significantly higher risk of gram-positive sepsis (OR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.26-10.92; P = .017) and late-onset sepsis (OR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.07-9.21; P = .037). In contrast, low MBL was associated with a significantly higher risk of gram-negative sepsis (OR, 4.39; 95% CI, 1.10-17.45; P = .036) and early-onset sepsis (OR, 3.87; 95% CI, 1.05-14.29; P = .042). The concentrations of all the lectin pathway proteins increased with gestational age (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS.

Evidence from single-country samples suggests that IPV may be an important risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services, but there is little large-scale evidence on this association. This paper evaluates whether IPV is a risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services in a large cross-country sample, and also compiles evidence on the relative effects of different forms of IPV. METHODS: We analyze the association between intimate partner violence and utilization of maternal health care, using a dataset compiling all Demographic and Health Surveys that report data on intimate partner violence. Using data on 166,685 women observed in 36 countries between 2005 and 2016, we estimate logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between lifetime experience of IPV and utilization of antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery care, and postnatal care. We estimate both unadjusted models and models adjusted for geographic and sociodemographic characteristics that are generally correlated with utilization of maternal health care (including age, education, number of children, wealth status, marital status, and urbanity). RESULTS: Lifetime experience of any IPV is associated with decreased use of maternal health services in a broad sample of births observed in lower and middle-income countries: in particular, the utilization of four or more ANC visits, the number of ANC visits, and the utilization of facility care at birth. This association remains statistically significant even after adjusting for country of residence, subnational region of residence, and additional individual-level covariates; however, there is no statistically significant association between experience of any IPV and postnatal care. The only form of IPV significantly associated with care utilization is physical IPV. CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing physical intimate partner violence show lower levels of utilization of maternal health services in a large sample of developing and middle-income countries. Given that reduced utilization of maternal health services is correlated with maternal and neonatal health outcomes, this pattern suggests that IPV prevention may be an important component of interventions targeting enhanced maternal and neonatal health.", "pub_date": "2021-02-25", "authors": ["Jessica Leight", "Nicholas Wilson"], "journal": "BMC public health", "doi": "10.1186/s12889-021-10447-y", "source": "pubmed"}

Trofinetide is the first approved treatment for people living with Rett syndrome, a rare genetic condition affecting brain development. This approval was based on the findings of clinical studies in which trofinetide showed significant improvements in the symptoms of Rett syndrome. In this study researchers were looking to see if the level of trofinetide in the blood was related to the level of improvement in symptoms observed in clinical studies. Information on the effectiveness of trofinetide was obtained from the phase 3 LAVENDER study which used doses of trofinetide according to body weight. Trofinetide’s effectiveness was assessed on the basis of clinical measurements of key Rett syndrome symptoms. All the information on trofinetide dose, blood levels, and how much symptoms changed (i.e., effectiveness of trofinetide) was then used to develop models to predict symptom responses in the observed population. Researchers found that as the blood levels of trofinetide increased the symptom improvement also increased. When the blood levels were at the recommended level that was achieved in the LAVENDER study, the model predicted that symptom improvement was up to seven times greater with trofinetide than having no treatment (i.e., placebo). This study shows a positive relationship between trofinetide blood levels and improvement in the symptoms of Rett syndrome.

Transgender adolescents are being treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues and subsequently cross-sex hormones at early or midpuberty, with genital surgery as the presumed final step in treatment for female-affirmed (male-to-female) individuals. Despite the minimum age of 18 as eligibility to undergo irreversible procedures, anecdotal reports show that vaginoplasties of female-affirmed patients under 18 have been performed by surgeons, thereby contravening the World Professional Association for Transgender Health Standards of Care. AIM: The purpose of this article is (i) to provide a review of salient factors regarding genital surgery in transgender adolescents; (ii) to review various ethical protocols for determining maturity in gender dysphoric individuals under 18; and (iii) to present a new systematic set of ethical principles largely derived from the surgical management of youths with disorders of sex development and adapted to the needs of transitioning adolescents. METHODS: A literature review of the topic was performed. Ethical guidelines derived from applied treatment protocols of children with disorders of sex development were written. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Progressing from the current state of ethical standards and clinical assumptions, a new development of ethical guidelines for genital surgery in the female-affirmed transgender adolescent was created. RESULTS: There were no controlled studies of vaginoplasties performed on female-affirmed adolescents under 18 years of age. A new set of ethical guidelines was created in order to support treatment professionals in their decision making process. CONCLUSIONS: Professionals across disciplines treating female-affirmed adolescents can utilize the proposed ethical guidelines to facilitate decision making on a case-by-case basis in order to protect both patients and practitioners. These guidelines may also be used in support of more open discussions and disclosures of surgical results that could further the advancement of treatment in this emerging population.", "pub_date": "2013-11-18", "authors": ["Christine Milrod"], "journal": "The journal of sexual medicine", "doi": "10.1111/jsm.12387", "source": "pubmed"}

To learn of the relevant biological pathways involved in fatigue among cancer survivors, the authors tested for an association between fatigue levels and leukocyte gene expression profiles and determined the specific mediating immune cell types. METHODS: A sample of 89 Hispanic/Latino adults aged 60.5 years, 62% of whom were male, who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer and were 2.9 years since diagnosis provided blood for transcriptome profiling and completed a validated measure of fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form). The authors applied genome-wide transcriptional profiling of leukocyte RNA to identify gene expression activity associated with fatigue, tested for the activity of specific transcription factors involved in previously established markers of inflammation and immunologic activation, and identified the specific cell types mediating these transcriptional alterations. RESULTS: In analyses adjusting for demographic and behavioral health risk factors, results linked fatigue with increased activation of B lymphocytes and CD8-positive T cells, as well as several transcription factors involved in immune activation (nuclear factor κB [NF-κB], signal transducer and activator of transcription [STAT], and cAMP responsive element-binding protein [CREB]). Results also replicated several specific genomic effects previously observed in fatigued cancer survivors, including upregulated expression of α-synuclein (SNCA) and hemoglobin subunits (HBA and HBB). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors' heightened fatigue levels may be partially explained by activation of specific immune cell subsets, thereby providing a potential molecular biomarker for clinical interventions targeting the remediation of fatigue.

Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms.

One IC child had polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome and the other child had graft-versus-host disease. Both of the children had a long course of diarrhea and no response to traditional treatment. FMT was performed on both patients via nasojejunal tubes under guidance of gastroduodenoscopy. After FMT, the patients achieved remission of symptoms and neither of them had related infectious complications.

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Nine Canadian ICUs. SUBJECTS: Three-hundred fifty-six septic patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical data and plasma levels of biomarkers were collected longitudinally. We used a complementary log-log model to account for the daily mortality risk of each patient until death in ICU/hospital, discharge, or 28 days after admission. The model, which is a versatile version of the Cox model for gaining longitudinal insights, created a composite indicator (the daily hazard of dying) from the \"day 1\" and \"change\" variables of six time-varying biological indicators (cell-free DNA, protein C, platelet count, creatinine, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and lactate) and a set of contextual variables (age, presence of chronic lung disease or previous brain injury, and duration of stay), achieving a high predictive power (conventional area under the curve, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94). Including change variables avoided misleading inferences about the effects of day 1 variables, signifying the importance of the longitudinal approach. We then generated mortality risk profiles that highlight the relative contributions among the time-varying biological indicators to overall mortality risk. The tool was validated in 28 nonseptic patients from the same ICUs who became septic later and was subject to 10-fold cross-validation, achieving similarly high area under the curve.

AREAS COVERED: A phase 3 clinical trial of solanezumab in preclinical Alzheimer's disease. In the A4 study, solanezumab did not reduce the decline in cognition or function and had no effect on brain amyloid burden. EXPERT OPINION: After the poor results in the EXPEDITION series of trials, the development of solanezumab should have been terminated. The rationale for undertaking the A4 trial was questionable, and the lack of benefit was probable. The controversial approval of two anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (aducanumab and lecanemab) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), despite a high incidence of amyloid-related imagining abnormalities (ARIA), may be fueling this continuation of clinical development of agents such as solanezumab.

Due to the transformation of food habits in developed countries over the last five decades, vitamin K and, specifically, vitamin K2 intakes among parents and their offspring have decreased significantly, resulting in serious health implications. The therapeutics used in pediatric practice (antibiotics and glucocorticoids) are also to blame for this situation. Low vitamin K status is much more frequent in newborns, due to both endogenous and exogenous insufficiencies. Just after birth vitamin K stores are low, and since human milk is relatively poor in this nutrient, breast-fed infants are at particular risk of a bleeding disorder called vitamin K deficiency bleeding. A pilot study showed that better vitamin K status is associated with lower rate of low-energy fracture incidence. An ongoing clinical trial is intended to address whether vitamin K2 and D3 supplementation might positively impact the biological process of bone healing. Vitamin K2 as menaquinone-7 (MK-7) has a documented history of safe and effective use.

Sepsis can be caused by a broad range of pathogens; however, bacterial infections represent the majority of sepsis cases. Up to 42% of sepsis presentations are culture negative, suggesting a non-bacterial cause. Despite this, diagnosis of viral sepsis remains very rare. Almost any virus can cause sepsis in vulnerable patients (e.g., neonates, infants, and other immunosuppressed groups). The prevalence of viral sepsis is not known, nor is there enough information to make an accurate estimate. The initial standard of care for all cases of sepsis, even those that are subsequently proven to be culture negative, is the immediate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the absence of definite diagnostic criteria for viral sepsis, or at least to exclude bacterial sepsis, this inevitably leads to unnecessary antimicrobial use, with associated consequences for antimicrobial resistance, effects on the host microbiome and excess healthcare costs. It is important to understand non-bacterial causes of sepsis so that inappropriate treatment can be minimised, and appropriate treatments can be developed to improve outcomes.

However, trofinetide neither improved the Caregiver Top 3 Concerns Visual Analog Scale nor the Rett Motor Behavioral Assessment. Regarding safety, trofinetide was significantly associated with vomiting compared to placebo (odds ratio (OR): 3.17, 95% CI: 1.57 to 6.43, P = 0.001). After solving heterogeneity, results showed a statistically significant incidence of diarrhea in the trofinetide (200 mg) group compared to placebo (OR: 18.51, 95% CI: 9.30 to 36.84, P ≤ 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Trofinetide demonstrated statistically significant improvements in CGI-I and RSBQ in pediatrics and adult patients with Rett. Side effects are limited to vomiting and diarrhea. Although diarrhea yielded an insignificant result in our analysis, it emerged as a cause for treatment discontinuation in the participating trials, and a statistically significant risk for diarrhea emerged when excluding the study using a lower dose of the drug, hence causing heterogeneity, in the meta-analysis. Given the diverse genetic landscape of RTT, future RCTs investigating correlations between RTT genotype and phenotypic improvements by trofinetide will be beneficial.

It is the manifestation of a cerebral lesion that took place during the maturing process of the brain. Spastic cerebral palsy is the most frequent variety. The spasticity presented by these patients strongly influences their functioning and gives rise to several complications that affect their quality of life. AIMS AND DEVELOPMENT: The main aim of this study is to determine a set of suitable and effective therapeutic steps that can be used to improve patients' spasticity and to prevent the complications that stem from them, such as contractures, deformities, surgery, etc. Multiple treatments were used, including physiotherapy, rehabilitation and oral pharmacotherapy, with few satisfactory results. At present there are two very promising therapeutic alternatives for patients with infantile cerebral palsy: Botulinum toxin, which we already have a great deal of experience with, and intrathecal treatment with baclofen. We report on a series of 10 patients aged between 8 and 15 years who had had an intrathecal baclofen infusion pump implanted. To date (maximum follow-up: 12 months), their clinical course has been satisfactory in most cases, with no severe complications related to the surgical technique, except in one individual who presented a fistula that resolved spontaneously. CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal baclofen seems to be a very useful alternative in the treatment of spasticity to improve the quality of life of these patients and those around them.", "pub_date": "2005-01-01", "authors": ["M Téllez de Meneses", "P Barbero", "J A Alvarez-Garijo", "F Mulas"], "journal": "Revista de neurologia", "doi": "", "source": "pubmed"}

Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are being explored to help children living with this disease. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been successful in some children with ulcerative colitis. However, the mechanism of its therapeutic effect in this patient population is not well understood. To characterize changes in gut microbial and metabolomic profiles after FMT, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, virome analysis and untargeted metabolomics by gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry on stool samples collected before and after FMT from four children with ulcerative colitis who responded to this treatment. Alpha diversity of the gut microbiota increased after intervention, with species richness rising from 251 (S.D. 125) to 358 (S.D. 27). In responders, the mean relative abundance of bacteria in the class Clostridia shifted toward donor levels, increasing from 33% (S.D. 11%) to 54% (S.D. 16%). Patient metabolomic and viromic profiles exhibited a similar but less pronounced shift toward donor profiles after FMT.

Accordingly, we undertook this systematic review of the literature to examine the evidence on the association between physical and emotional abuse and pregnancy outcomes. STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: A comprehensive literature search was carried out using pertinent key words that would retrieve any research article pertaining to the topic. This was supplemented by cross-referencing of the articles. A total of 296 articles were found; case reports and articles that failed to satisfy the study inclusion criteria were removed and 30 articles were included in the review. RESULTS: Overall, adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight, maternal mortality and infant mortality are significantly more likely among abused than nonabused mothers. Abused pregnant mothers present more often than nonabused mothers with kidney infections, gain less weight during pregnancy, and are more likely to undergo operative delivery. Fetal morbidity, such as low birth weight, preterm delivery, and small size for gestational age are more frequent among abused than nonabused gravidas. The risk for maternal mortality is three times as high for abused mothers. Black abused mothers are 3-4 times as likely to die as their white counterparts. Unmarried victims are also three times as likely to die as married abused mothers. Intimate partner violence is also responsible for increased fetal deaths in affected pregnancies (about 16.0 per 1000). CONCLUSION: Intimate partner violence is often a life-threatening event to both the mother and the fetus. This, in addition to the heightened level of feto-maternal morbidity and mortality, represents clear-cut justification for routine systematic screening for the presence of abuse during pregnancy.", "pub_date": "2004-01-01", "authors": ["Angie Boy", "Hamisu M Salihu"], "journal": "International journal of fertility and women's medicine", "doi": "", "source": "pubmed"}

This female preponderance for abnormal autoimmune function has largely gone unexplained. Many investigations have concentrated on the effects of female and male sex hormones on immune function, by suggesting that estrogens favor the antibody production-enhancing Th2 response and, by doing so, possibly, increase the risk towards abnormal autoimmune function. Others have suggested that women are genetically predisposed towards abnormal autoimmune function, possibly because the X chromosome may confer susceptibility towards tolerance breakdown. Recent developments have, however, opened new research avenues. The possible association between persistent fetal-maternal microchimerism and the development of autoimmune diseases has attracted special interest. Since, in analogy to allogeneic organ transplantation, fetal-maternal (and maternal-fetal) microchimerism may play an important role in the immunologic tolerance of the fetal semi-allograft, female preponderance for autoimmune diseases may be understood as a consequence of increased allogeneic cell traffic in females (in comparison to males), increased risk for long-term microchimerism and, therefore, as a consequence of the former two, the development of abnormal autoimmunity. Under an evolutionary view point the occurrence of autoimmune diseases, in general, can be seen as the price to be paid for successful reproduction. In view of increased exposure to cell traffic, women, of course, would be expected to pay a higher price, reflected in more autoimmunity.", "pub_date": "2007-01-29", "authors": ["Norbert Gleicher", "David H Barad"], "journal": "Journal of autoimmunity", "doi": "10.1016/j.jaut.2006.12.004", "source": "pubmed"}

DESIGN: This was a multicenter, phase III, contraceptive efficacy clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1045 healthy fertile Chinese men were recruited throughout China into the study. INTERVENTION(S): Injections of 500 mg TU were administered monthly for 30 months. A definition of severe oligozoospermia (< or =1 x 10(6)/ml) was used as a criterion of spermatogenic suppression and as the threshold for entering the contraceptive efficacy phase. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The primary outcome was pregnancy rate in the partner. Other outcomes include: semen parameters, testis volumes, reproductive hormone levels, and safety laboratory tests. RESULTS: Forty-three participants (4.8%) did not achieve azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia within the 6-month suppression phase. A total of 855 participants entered into the efficacy phase, and 733 participants completed monthly TU treatment and follow-up.

A menaquinone form of vitamin K, MK4, is increasingly recognized for its key roles in mitochondrial electron transport, as a ligand for the nuclear receptor SXR, which controls the expression of genes involved in transport and metabolism of endo- and xenobiotics, and as a pharmacotherapeutic in the treatment of osteoporosis. Although cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4F2 activity is recognized as an important determinant of phylloquinone (K1) metabolism, the enzymes involved in menaquinone catabolism have not been studied previously. CYP4F2 and CYP4F11 were expressed and purified and found to be equally efficient as in vitro catalysts of MK4 ω-hydroxylation. CYP4F2, but not CYP4F11, catalyzed sequential metabolism of MK4 to the ω-acid without apparent release of the intermediate aldehyde. The ω-alcohol could also be metabolized to the acid by microsomal NAD(+)-dependent alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases. LC-MS/MS analysis of trypsinized human liver microsomes (using a surrogate peptide approach) revealed the mean concentrations of CYP4F2 and CYP4F11 to be 14.3 and 8.4 pmol/mg protein, respectively. Microsomal MK4 ω-hydroxylation activities correlated with the CYP4F2 V433M genotype but not the CYP4F11 D446N genotype.

METHODS: A rat model of cerebral palsy was established using perinatal anoxia and sensorimotor restriction of hindlimbs during infancy. Kaempferol (1 mg/ kg) was intraperitoneally administered during the neonatal period. RESULTS: Neonatal treatment with kaempferol reduces the impact of the cerebral palsy model on reflex ontogeny and on the maturation of physical features. Impairment of locomotor activity development and motor coordination was found to be attenuated by kaempferol treatment during the neonatal period in rats exposed to cerebral palsy. Neonatal treatment of kaempferol in cerebral palsy rats prevents a substantial reduction in the number of neural precursor cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, an activated microglia profile, and increased proliferation of microglia in the sub-granular zone and in the granular cell layer. Neonatal treatment with kaempferol increases gene expression of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the hippocampus of rats submitted to the cerebral palsy model. DISCUSSION: Kaempferol attenuates the impact of cerebral palsy on neuromotor behavior development, preventing altered hippocampal microglia activation and mitigating impaired cell proliferation in a neurogenic niche in these rats. Neonatal treatment with kaempferol also increases antioxidant defense gene expression in the hippocampus of rats submitted to the cerebral palsy model.", "pub_date": "2022-12-28", "authors": ["Diego Bulcão Visco", "Raul Manhães-de-Castro", "Márcia Maria da Silva", "Bárbara J R Costa-de-Santana", "Joaci Pereira Dos Santos Junior", "Luís Miguel Saavedra", "Maria Daniele Teixeira Beltrão de Lemos", "Juan José Valdéz-Alarcón", "Claudia Jacques Lagranha", "Omar Guzman-Quevedo", "Luz Torner", "Ana Elisa Toscano"], "journal": "Nutritional neuroscience", "doi": "10.1080/1028415X.2022.2156034", "source": "pubmed"}

The pathogenesis of ALS is associated with the accumulation of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) proteins and neurofilaments in motor neurons, highlighting the critical need for disease-modifying treatments. Current therapies, such as riluzole and edaravone, provide only symptomatic relief. Recently, tofersen gained approval from the US FDA under the brand name Qalsody as the first and only gene therapy for ALS, addressing a significant pathological aspect of the disease. METHODS: We carried out a literature survey using PubMed, Scopus, National Institutes of Health, and Biogen for articles published in the English language concerned with \"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\", pathophysiology, current treatment, treatment under clinical trial, and the newly approved drug \"tofersen\" and its detailed summary. RESULTS: A comprehensive review of the literature on the pathophysiology, available treatment, and newly approved drug for this condition revealed convincing evidence that we are now able to better monitor and treat ALS. CONCLUSIONS: Although treatment of ALS is difficult, the newly approved drug tofersen has emerged as a potential therapy to slow down the progression of ALS by targeting SOD1 mRNA, representing a significant advancement in the treatment of ALS.", "pub_date": "2023-11-17", "authors": ["Aniket Saini", "Pooja A Chawla"], "journal": "European journal of neurology", "doi": "10.1111/ene.16140", "source": "pubmed"}

Inactivation of TMEM116 reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness of human cancer cells and suppressed A549 induced tumor metastasis in mouse lungs. In addition, TMEM116 deficiency inhibited PDK1-AKT-FOXO3A signaling pathway, resulting in accumulation of TAp63, while activation of PDK1 largely reversed the TMEM116 deficiency induced defects in cancer cell motility, migration and invasive.

In PD, as well as in other neurodegenerative disorders, it has been proposed that the combination of multiple factors might contribute to the onset of the disease. Indeed, several authors have suggested that environmental factors, such as pollutants and chemicals, might be associated with the onset of several neurodegenerative disorders. On the other hand, several studies have described that the nociceptin/orphanin-NOP and prodynorphin-KOP opioid systems are implicated in the pathology of Parkinson's disease. Considering the nonrestricted commercial availability and common use of several pesticides, such as paraquat and maneb, in agriculture of less developed countries, the aim of our study was to investigate the involvement of nociceptin/orphanin-NOP and prodynorphin-KOP systems in a chronic paraquat and maneb animal model of Parkinson's disease. Our results showed that after paraquat/maneb (5/15 mg kg(-1) ) treatment, a significant reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis, was observed. Also, the association of paraquat and maneb (5/15 mg kg(-1) ) induced an increase in nociceptin/orphanin and a decrease of prodynorphin gene expression levels in the substantia nigra with a down-regulation of NOP and KOP receptors after both treatments in the substantia nigra and caudate putamen. These data further confirm that paraquat and maneb toxicity can modulate gene expression of the nociceptin/orphanin-NOP receptor and prodynorphin-KOP receptor systems in the substantia nigra and caudate putamen, offering further support to the hypothesis that chronic exposure to these agrochemicals might be implicated in the mechanisms underlying sporadic Parkinson's disease. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The development of innovative and efficacious targeted treatments for fatigue in multiple sclerosis has been marred by the limited knowledge of the underlying mechanisms. One of the hypotheses postulates that multiple sclerosis pathology might cause reduced monoaminergic release in the central nervous system with consequences on motivation, mood and attention. Here, we applied the recently developed Receptor-Enriched Analysis of Functional Connectivity by Targets method to investigate whether patients with high and low fatigue differ in the functional connectivity (FC) of the monoamine circuits in the brain. We recruited 55 patients with multiple sclerosis, which were then classified as highly fatigued or mildly fatigued based on their scores on the cognitive sub-scale of the Modified Fatigue Impact scale. We acquired resting-state functional MRI scans and derived individual maps of connectivity associated with the distribution of the dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin transporters as measured by positron emission tomography. We found that patients with high fatigue present decreased noradrenaline transporter (NAT)-enriched connectivity in several frontal and prefrontal areas when compared to those with lower fatigue. The NAT-enriched FC predicted negatively individual cognitive fatigue scores. Our findings support the idea that alterations in the catecholaminergic functional circuits underlie fatigue in multiple sclerosis and identify the NAT as a putative therapeutic target directed to pathophysiology.", "pub_date": "2021-03-05", "authors": ["Mara Cercignani", "Ottavia Dipasquale", "Iulia Bogdan", "Tiziana Carandini", "James Scott", "Waqar Rashid", "Osama Sabri", "Swen Hesse", "Michael Rullmann", "Leonardo Lopiano", "Mattia Veronese", "Daniel Martins", "Marco Bozzali"], "journal": "Brain communications", "doi": "10.1093/braincomms/fcab023", "source": "pubmed"}

The name of the disease indicates that in addition to the typical symptoms of conventional MPS, patients develop other features such as congenital heart defects and kidney and hematopoietic system disorders. The symptoms are highly advanced, and patients usually do not survive past the second year of life. MPSPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a homozygous-specific mutation in the gene encoding the VPS33A protein. To date, it has been described in 41 patients. Patients with MPSPS exhibited excessive excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the urine and exceptionally high levels of heparan sulfate in the plasma, but the accumulation of substrates is not caused by a decrease in the activity of any lysosomal enzymes. Here, we discuss the pathomechanisms and symptoms of MPSPS, comparing them to those of MPS. Moreover, we asked the question whether MPSPS should be classified as a type of MPS or a separate disease, as contrary to 'classical' MPS types, despite GAG accumulation, no defects in lysosomal enzymes responsible for degradation of these compounds could be detected in MPSPS. The molecular mechanism of the appearance of GAG accumulation in MPSPS is suggested on the basis of results available in the literature.", "pub_date": "2024-09-04", "authors": ["Zuzanna Cyske", "Lidia Gaffke", "Karolina Pierzynowska", "Grzegorz Węgrzyn"], "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "doi": "10.3390/ijms25179570", "source": "pubmed"}

Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.", "pub_date": "2023-09-05", "authors": ["Soumya Jha", "Rupa Jha", "Wenona Fernandes", "Ashish Srivastava"], "journal": "Indian journal of psychiatry", "doi": "10.4103/indianjpsychiatry.indianjpsychiatry_239_23", "source": "pubmed"}

Our aim was to estimate the prevalence and perinatal and early life factors associated with symptoms of depression in children aged 7 to 11 years from two Brazilian birth cohorts. METHODS: The study was conducted on 1444 children whose data were collected at birth and at school age, in 1994 and 2004/2005 in Ribeirao Preto, where they were aged 10-11 years and in 1997/98 and 2005/06 in São Luís, where children were aged 7-9 years. Depressive symptoms were investigated with the Child Depression Inventory(CDI), categorized as yes (score ≥ 20) and no (score < 20). Adjusted and non-adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated by Poisson regression with robust estimation of the standard errors. RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 3.9% (95%CI = 2.5-5.4) in Ribeirão Preto and 13.7% (95%CI = 11.0-16.4) in São Luís. In the adjusted analysis, in Ribeirão Preto, low birth weight (PR = 3.98; 95%CI = 1.72-9.23), skilled and semi-skilled manual occupation (PR = 5.30; 95%CI = 1.14-24.76) and unskilled manual occupation and unemployment (PR = 6.65; 95%CI = 1.16-38.03) of the household head were risk factors for depressive symptoms.

Recent research, however, suggests a role of vitamin K in bone metabolism. The metabolic role of vitamin K is to facilitate the carboxylation of glutamyl to gamma-carboxyglutamyl residues. Besides the hepatic tissue, in which the clotting factors are produced gamma-carboxyglutamyl-containing proteins are also abundantly available in bone tissue. Osteocalcin accounts for up to 80% of the total gamma-carboxyglutamyl content of mature bone. Human carboxylated osteocalcin contains 3 gamma-carboxyglutamyl residues which confer a highly specific affinity to the calcium ion of the hydroxyapatite molecule. Besides the gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin vitamin K may also affect other parameters of bone metabolism, such as calcium hemostasis, and prostaglandin E2 and interleukin 6 production. Evidence from observational studies and first intervention trials indicate that vitamin K intakes much higher than the current recommendations improved biochemical markers of bone formation as well as bone density.

Evidence-based psychological treatments for common childhood mental health disorders (anxiety, depression and disruptive behaviour disorders) have not been systematically evaluated in young people with epilepsy despite their high prevalence in this population. The aim of this multi-site randomised controlled trial is to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of adding a modular psychological intervention to usual care for the mental health disorders in comparison to assessment-enhanced usual care alone. METHODS: In total, 334 participants aged 3-18 years attending epilepsy services will be screened for mental health disorders with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the diagnostic Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA). Those identified as having a mental health disorder and consenting to the trial will be randomised to either receive up to 22 sessions of the modular psychological intervention (MATCH-ADTC) delivered over the telephone over 6 months by non-mental health professionals in addition to usual care or to assessment-enhanced usual care alone. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6 months and 12 months post-randomisation. It is hypothesised that MATCH-ADTC plus usual care will be superior to assessment-enhanced usual care in improving emotional and behavioural symptoms. The primary outcome is the SDQ reported by parents at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include parent-reported mental health measures such as the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale, quality of life measures such as the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory and physical health measures such as the Hague Seizure Severity Scale. Outcome assessors will be blinded to group assignment. Qualitative process evaluations and a health economic evaluation will also be completed. DISCUSSION: This trial aims to determine whether a systematic and integrated approach to the identification and treatment of mental health disorders in children and young people with epilepsy is clinically and cost-effective. The findings will contribute to policies and practice with regard to addressing mental health needs in children and young people with other long-term conditions.

However, the clinical criteria for this definition were neither designed for nor validated in children. We validated the performance of SIRS, age-adapted SOFA, quick SOFA and PELOD-2 scores as predictors of outcome in children. METHODS: We performed a multicentre binational cohort study of patients < 18 years admitted with infection to ICUs in Australia and New Zealand. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. SIRS, age-adapted SOFA, quick SOFA and PELOD-2 scores were compared using crude and adjusted area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis. RESULTS: Of 2594 paediatric ICU admissions due to infection, 151 (5.8%) children died, and 949/2594 (36.6%) patients died or experienced an ICU length of stay ≥ 3 days. A ≥ 2-point increase in the individual score was associated with a crude mortality increase from 3.1 to 6.8% for SIRS, from 1.9 to 7.6% for age-adapted SOFA, from 1.7 to 7.3% for PELOD-2, and from 3.9 to 8.1% for qSOFA (p < 0.001). The discrimination of outcomes was significantly higher for SOFA (adjusted AUROC 0.829; 0.791-0.868) and PELOD-2 (0.816; 0.777-0.854) than for qSOFA (0.739; 0.695-0.784) and SIRS (0.710; 0.664-0.756). CONCLUSIONS: SIRS criteria lack specificity to identify children with infection at substantially higher risk of mortality. We demonstrate that adapting Sepsis-3 to age-specific criteria performs better than Sepsis-2-based criteria.

DEVELOPMENT: The neurological evaluation of learning disorders is based on clinical examination which includes the so-called minor signs of the noetic functions, specifically language, the praxes, gnosias, perceptive-motor function, laterality and the lexical, graphic and calculation functions together with the modulating element, mentioned above, of the level of attention with or without hyperactivity. These semiological elements are grouped into three major categories of syndromes: motor syndrome, dyslexic-dysgraphic-dyscalculation syndrome and the hyperkinetic syndrome or attention deficit with hyperactivity. We also note the differential diagnosis. We review the neurophysiological biological markers (EEG and brain mapping, cerebral evoked potentials, neurometry) and those based on neuroimaging techniques (cerebral CT, MR, SPECT and PET).

Disease-modifying therapies targeting T cells have, indeed, shown remarkable efficacy in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. However, these therapies do also target B cells, and a B-cell-depleting monoclonal antibody (ocrelizumab) has recently been approved for MS therapy and is efficacious not only in relapsing forms of MS but also in some patients with primary progressive MS. This suggests that B cells may play a more important role in the pathogenesis of MS than previously appreciated. We review the potential roles of B cells, which are the precursors of antibody-secreting plasma cells in the pathogenesis of MS. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the characteristics and clinical data for the four monoclonal antibodies (ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, rituximab, and ublituximab) that have been approved, are currently been used off-label or are being investigated as treatments for MS. These antibodies all target the cluster of differentiation (CD)-20 molecule and bind to distinct or overlapping epitopes on B cells and a subset of T cells that express CD20. This leads to B-cell depletion and, possibly, to depletion of CD20-positive T cells.

This has led to the emergence of  OBJECTIVE: This paper analyzes the role and functions of a neuropsychologist in primary schools and the possibilities of his/her collaboration with other specialists in diagnosing children's problems and organizing remediation for problematic kids. DESIGN: We established four steps for launching neuropsychological work at primary schools: 1) setting up a screening group for neuropsychological assessment of all children entering the first year of school; 2) a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of the children who showed poor results in the first step of the study; 3)ateam remediation program; and 4) evaluation of the remediation results by a new neuropsychological assessment at the end of the remediation program. RESULTS: The results of the first step of our study showed a very high percentage of children with cognitive problems- 37% of 202 6-8 year-old schoolchildren entering the first year of school. They formed a group at risk for future learning disabilities and maladjustment at school. Age and gender differences, and the structure of cognitive underdevelopment, were discussed in the second step of our study. In the third step, a team of school specialists, including a neuropsychologist, a teacher, a school psychologist, and a school social worker, implemented a remediation program which was created and supervised by a neuropsychologist. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of the pupils revealed a complex structure of cognitive disturbances which interfere with pupils' learning abilities in primary school.

Growing evidence suggests B cells to play a crucial role in its pathogenesis and progression. Over the last decades, monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against the surface protein CD20 have been intensively studied as a B cell targeting therapy in relapsing MS (RMS) as well as primary progressive MS (PPMS). Pivotal studies on anti-CD20 therapy in RMS showed remarkable clinical and radiological effects, especially on acute inflammation and relapse biology. These results paved the way for further research on the implication of B cells in the pathogenesis of MS. Besides controlling relapse development in RMS, ocrelizumab (OCR) also showed clinical benefits in patients with PPMS and became the first approved drug for this disease course. In this review, we provide an overview of the current anti-CD20 mabs used or tested for the treatment of MS-namely rituximab (RTX), OCR, ofatumumab (OFA), and ublituximab (UB).

These disabilities are due to the neurological disorders which affects brain functions. Early diagnosis of these disabilities in kids from age 3 to 6 will help to start early medical treatments and get them back to the normal condition. MATERIAL AND METHOD: we developed a software-based Learning Disability Evaluation Kit called YALU with computer Game Modules for kids targeting their learning disabilities. These Computer game-based modules of the YALU consist of different tasks for the different age levels to identify the symptoms of the disabilities mentioned above. The children's interaction results to each task of the game modules with the answers of the questioner about the children given by the parents will be evaluated with the threshold values given by a panel of consultant psychologist and paediatrician of the normal kids to identify the learning disabilities in kids aged 3-6 years. The result will be given to the respective parties and uploaded to the Website under the child's name. RESULT: YALU has been tested using 50 students in age 3-5 in three preschools. The teachers have identified Fourteen students with some learning disability symptoms. Using YALU, twelve out of fourteen students had been clearly identified. Hence, the YALU Evaluation Kit to have an accuracy 85% in diagnosing the right disability.

This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the association between early pregnancy REE exposure and maternal thyroid function, as well as neonatal birth outcomes, in a cohort of pregnant women in Beijing, China. Additionally, the study explored the mediating role of thyroid homeostasis in the effects of REE exposure. Serum concentrations of fifteen REEs, along with Free Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), were measured in 195 pregnant women. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified significant correlations between REE exposure and disruptions in maternal thyroid homeostasis. Specifically, Praseodymium (Pr) and Lutetium (Lu) were positively associated with FT4 levels, while Gadolinium (Gd) showed a positive correlation with TSH levels. Conversely, Thulium (Tm) was negatively associated with FT4 levels, and Yttrium (Y) was negatively correlated with TSH levels, indicating distinct interactions of specific REEs with thyroid regulation. Notably, Lu remained positively correlated with FT4 levels (β = 1.39, 95% CI = 0.55, 2.22) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding neonatal birth outcomes, Dysprosium (Dy) was found to be negatively associated with infant birth weight (β = -0.09, 95% CI = -0.170, -0.002).

We examined their respective performance in identifying children who had a discharge diagnosis of infection at high risk of mortality using PICU registry data, with additional focus on the influence of age on performance. DESIGN: Analysis of retrospective data obtained from the Virtual Pediatric Systems PICU database. The performance in predicting observed mortality was assessed for the three candidate approaches using receiver operating characteristics analysis, including age group effects. SETTING: The Virtual Pediatric Systems database contains data on diagnosis, clinical markers, and outcomes in prospectively collected clinical records from 130 participating PICUs in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: Children who had a discharge diagnosis of infection in a participating PICU between 2009 and 2014, for which all required data were available. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data from 40,228 children revealed an overall mortality of 4.22%. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (95% CI) was 0.760 (0.749-0.771) for Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 with mechanical ventilation, 0.700 (0.689-0.712) for Pediatric Advanced Life Support, and 0.709 (0.696-0.721) for International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference. When split by age group, the performance of Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 with mechanical ventilation was lowest in the youngest neonates (under 1 wk old), with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (95% CI) of 0.724 (0.656-0.791), and in the teenagers (13-18 yr), with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.710 (0.682-0.738), yet it still outperformed Pediatric Advanced Life Support and International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among critically ill children who had a discharge diagnosis of infection in the PICU, quick Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment score performs best when using the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 age thresholds with mechanical ventilation, while all definitions performed worse at extremes of pediatric age. Thus, mortality risk varies with vital sign thresholds, and although Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 with mechanical ventilation performed marginally better, it is unlikely to be of use to clinicians.

Lecanemab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid protofibrils for the treatment of early AD. In the phase II BAN2401-G000-201 trial (NCT01767311), lecanemab reduced amyloid accumulated in the brain and slowed progression on key global and cognitive scales evaluating efficacy after 18 months of treatment. METHODS: A disease simulation model was used to predict the long-term clinical outcomes of lecanemab for patients with early AD [i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and mild AD dementia] on the basis of BAN2401-G000-201 trial data and published literature. The model captures the pathophysiology and management of AD, with a focus on simulating the effects of disease modification and early intervention on disease progression. The model compares lecanemab in addition to standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone. RESULTS: Lecanemab treatment was estimated to slow the rate of disease progression, resulting in an extended duration of MCI due to AD and mild AD dementia and shortened duration in moderate and severe AD dementia. The mean time to mild, moderate, and severe AD dementia was longer for patients in the lecanemab + SoC group than for patients in the SoC group by 2.51, 3.13, and 2.34 years, respectively. On base-case analysis, lecanemab was associated with 0.73 incremental life years (LY) and 0.75 incremental quality-adjusted LYs (QALY), and the caregiver QALYs lost was reduced by 0.03 years. The model also predicted a lower lifetime probability of admission to institutional care in lecanemab + SoC versus SoC group (25% versus 31%). CONCLUSION: The model results demonstrate the potential clinical value of lecanemab for patients with early AD and how it can slow the rate of disease progression and reduce the lifetime probability for institutionalized care.", "pub_date": "2022-04-25", "authors": ["Amir Abbas Tahami Monfared", "Ali Tafazzoli", "Weicheng Ye", "Ameya Chavan", "Quanwu Zhang"], "journal": "Neurology and therapy", "doi": "10.1007/s40120-022-00350-y", "source": "pubmed"}

METHODS: Narrative review of relevant literature identified through existing systematic reviews, meta-analyses and a PubMed search.

RESULTS: Although causality is unclear, heavy and dependent cannabis use is consistently associated with a high prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders and learning and memory impairments that seem to recover after a period of abstinence. Evidence regarding other cognitive domains and neurological consequences, including cerebrovascular events, is limited and inconsistent. Abstinence after treatment is only achieved in a minority of cases; treatment targeted at reduction in use appears have some success. Potential moderators of the impact of CUD on the brain include age of onset, heaviness of use, CUD severity, the ratio of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol to cannabidiol and severity of comorbid disorders.

Early research suggests that the iron chelator deferiprone can reduce nigrostriatal iron content in persons with Parkinson's disease, but its effects on disease progression are unclear. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, phase 2, randomized, double-blind trial involving participants with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease who had never received levodopa. Participants were assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive oral deferiprone at a dose of 15 mg per kilogram of body weight twice daily or matched placebo for 36 weeks. Dopaminergic therapy was withheld unless deemed necessary for symptom control. The primary outcome was the change in the total score on the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS; range, 0 to 260, with higher scores indicating more severe impairment) at 36 weeks. Secondary and exploratory clinical outcomes at up to 40 weeks included measures of motor and nonmotor disability. Brain iron content measured with the use of magnetic resonance imaging was also an exploratory outcome. RESULTS: A total of 372 participants were enrolled; 186 were assigned to receive deferiprone and 186 to receive placebo. Progression of symptoms led to the initiation of dopaminergic therapy in 22.0% of the participants in the deferiprone group and 2.7% of those in the placebo group. The mean MDS-UPDRS total score at baseline was 34.3 in the deferiprone group and 33.2 in the placebo group and increased (worsened) by 15.6 points and 6.3 points, respectively (difference, 9.3 points; 95% confidence interval, 6.3 to 12.2; P<0.001). Nigrostriatal iron content decreased more in the deferiprone group than in the placebo group. The main serious adverse events with deferiprone were agranulocytosis in 2 participants and neutropenia in 3 participants. CONCLUSIONS: In participants with early Parkinson's disease who had never received levodopa and in whom treatment with dopaminergic medications was not planned, deferiprone was associated with worse scores in measures of parkinsonism than those with placebo over a period of 36 weeks.

The recently established therapeutic targeting of B cells in MS patients using CD20 monoclonal antibodies (CD20-mAbs) not only profoundly suppresses inflammatory disease activity but also materializes as the first treatment approach against disability accumulation in a subset of patients with primary progressive MS. AREAS COVERED: We will review current concepts regarding the immunopathology of B cells as well as results of clinical trials with CD20-mAbs in MS, from the murine-human chimeras rituximab and ublituximab to their increasingly humanized counterparts ocrelizumab and ofatumumab. We conducted a literature search using PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov, and clinicaltrialsregister.eu. We will focus on studies emphasizing the effectiveness of these mAbs in reducing MS disease activity and progression, long-term safety, optimal dosage and maintenance regimens. Lastly, we will turn to outstanding questions regarding anti-CD20 therapy in MS. EXPERT OPINION: CD20-mAbs could become first-line drugs in selected patients with highly active MS and already constitute an option for PPMS. Future studies could evaluate whether administration regimens currently in use can be optimized, while registry data could shed light on risk versus benefits on the long run, considering immunosenescence and a potentially increased risk of malignancies and infections in an aging population.", "pub_date": "2019-05-24", "authors": ["Mihai Ancau", "Achim Berthele", "Bernhard Hemmer"], "journal": "Expert opinion on biological therapy", "doi": "10.1080/14712598.2019.1611778", "source": "pubmed"}

Lecanemab is a humanized anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody directed towards Aβ protofibrils. Lecanemab is the only drug that targets Aβ soluble protofibrils and has shown statistical differences in mild AD or mild cognitive impairment. In its landmark phase III trial, lecanemab was shown to slow the progression of clinical decline, and a reduction in amyloid protein accumulation. The difference in mean CDR-SOB score improvement between the treatment and placebo groups was -0.45, of which the clinical significance could be argued. Amyloid burden was also considerably reduced as well, but the true clinical consequence of this reduction remains to be seen. This beneficial impact on daily living is offset by rare but serious side effects including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) causing cerebral edema (ARIA-E) or cerebral microhemorrhages or hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H). Benefits of therapy must be considered against the risk of cerebral microhemorrhages and edema. Affordability must also be taken into consideration. The current estimated yearly cost for twice monthly lecanemab infusion is $26,500. In addition to the significant cost challenges, the frequent infusions may pose concerns related to access.

We report here an exploratory analysis assessing whether prasinezumab showed greater benefits on motor signs progression in prespecified subgroups with faster motor progression. Prasinezumab's potential effects on disease progression were assessed in four prespecified and six exploratory subpopulations of PASADENA: use of monoamine oxidase B inhibitors at baseline (yes versus no); Hoehn and Yahr stage (2 versus 1); rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (yes versus no); data-driven subphenotypes (diffuse malignant versus nondiffuse malignant); age at baseline (≥60 years versus <60 years); sex (male versus female); disease duration (>12 months versus <12 months); age at diagnosis (≥60 years versus <60 years); motor subphenotypes (akinetic-rigid versus tremor-dominant); and motor subphenotypes (postural instability gait dysfunction versus tremor-dominant). In these subpopulations, the effect of prasinezumab on slowing motor signs progression (MDS-UPDRS Part III) was greater in the rapidly progressing subpopulations (for example, participants who were diffuse malignant or taking monoamine oxidase B inhibitors at baseline).

DESIGN: Prospective clinical study of children with sepsis syndrome or septic shock. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS: 31 children with sepsis syndrome or septic shock. INTERVENTIONS: A tonometer was passed into the stomach via the orogastric route. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The following data were recorded at admission, 12, 24 and 48 h: heart rate, mean arterial pressure, arterial pH, base deficit, arterial lactate, gastric intramucosal pH (pHi) and DCO2 (intramucosal carbon dioxide tension minus arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide). The principal outcome measure was. The secondary outcome measure was the number of organ systems failing at 48 h after admission. There were 10 deaths and 21 survivors. No variable discriminated survival from death at presentation. Blood lactate level was the earliest discriminator of survival. Using univariate logistic regression, lactate discriminated survivors from those who died at 12 and 24 h after admission, but not at 48 h (p = 0.049, 0.044 and 0.062, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for lactate was 0.81, 0.88 and 0.89 at 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. At 12 h after admission, a blood lactate level > 3 mmol/l had a positive predictive value for death of 56% and a lactate level of 3 mmol/l or less had a positive predictive value for survival of 84%. At 24 h a lactate level > 3 mmol/l had a positive predictive value for death of 71% and a level of 3 mmol/l or less had a positive predictive value for survival of 86%. No other variable identified non-survivors from survivors at 12 h. Gastric tonometry could only be done on 19 of the 31 children, of whom 8 died and 11 survived. In these 19 children, DCO2 measured at 24 h, but not at 12 or 48 h, distinguished those who died from those who survived (p = 0.045 and p = 0.20, respectively). The area under the ROC curve for DCO2 measured at 24 h as a predictor of survival was 0.71.

It remains however unclear whether FUS is being introduced in an ethically and methodologically sound manner. The IDEAL-D framework for the introduction of surgical innovations and the SYRCLE and ROBINS-I tools for assessing the risk of bias in animal studies and non-randomized trials, respectively, provide a comprehensive evaluation for this. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature review on FUS in neuro-oncology was conducted. Subsequently, the included studies were evaluated using the IDEAL-D framework, SYRCLE, and ROBINS-I tools. RESULTS: In total, 19 published studies and 12 registered trials were identified. FUS demonstrated successful BBB disruption, increased drug delivery, and improved survival rates. However, the SYRCLE analysis revealed a high risk of bias in animal studies, while the ROBINS-I analysis found that most human studies had a high risk of bias due to a lack of blinding and heterogeneous samples. Of the 15 pre-clinical stage 0 studies, only six had formal ethical approval, and only five followed animal care policies. Both stage 1 studies and stage 1/2a studies failed to provide information on patient data confidentiality. Overall, no animal or human study reached the IDEAL-D stage endpoint. CONCLUSION: FUS holds promise for enhancing drug delivery to the brain, but its development and implementation must adhere to rigorous safety standards using the established ethical and methodological frameworks. The complementary use of IDEAL-D, SYRCLE, and ROBINS-I tools indicates a high risk of bias and ethical limitations in both animal and human studies, highlighting the need for further improvements in study design for a safe implementation of FUS in neuro-oncology.", "pub_date": "2023-09-06", "authors": ["Santhosh G Thavarajasingam", "John L Kilgallon", "Daniele S C Ramsay", "Leila Motedayen Aval", "Ishaan Ashwini Tewarie", "Andreas Kramer", "Dannis Van Vuurden", "Marike L D Broekman"], "journal": "Acta neurochirurgica", "doi": "10.1007/s00701-023-05782-5", "source": "pubmed"}

These findings emphasize the importance of early identification of children and adolescents having elevated risk for future depression and further development, evaluation and greater availability of prevention strategies. Our review aims an update about depressive vulnerability in children and adolescents in the perspective of better identification of at-risk populations and targeting of prevention programs. Psychopathology, in particular anxiety and disruptive disorders are well identified risk-factors for later depression. Subclinical depressive symptomatology, also termed \"demoralization\", also identifies high-risk populations, likely to become incident cases of depression. It is still unclear whether this condition is prodromal depression, a specific clinical entity or the expression of biological and/or cognitive vulnerability. Familial risk for depressive disorders involves both genetic and psychosocial factors. Marital discord, poor communication and dysfunctional parenting practices are often present in families with affective disorders and can be implicated in increased depressive vulnerability in the offspring. Research on individual vulnerability in children and adolescents has focused on temperamental and cognitive characteristics. Temperament traits describe individual differences in reactivity and behavior. High emotionality, defined as the tendency to become upset easily and intensely has been associated with an increased risk for subsequent major depression. However, as the majority of high scorers will not become depressive cases, emotionality should not be the only criterion for selection of at-risk populations. Cognitive style including poor self esteem, low social competence and negative attributions are also associated with increased likelihood of depressive symptoms, but their predictive value for the onset of clinical depressive episodes needs further investigation. Familial and individual vulnerability is likely to heighten the depressogenic impact of life events and psycho-social adversity. Prevention interventions have been developed in the United States for children and adolescents at-risk for depression. In France, clinicians witness growing demands from families with affective illness concerned with risk of parent-child transmission of depressive vulnerability, prevention and early identification of symptoms. To meet this kind of emerging needs and to prevent family dysfunction, a preventive program targets offspring of depressed parents and uses clinician-based family approaches. Family and individual sessions aim a better understanding of illness experience and encourage the parents to identify and foster resilience in their children. Another type of preventive intervention focuses on children and adolescents with subclinical depressive symptoms, eventually associated with behavioral problems ou high level of parental conflict, recruited in school settings. These school-based interventions combine cognitive and social problem-solving techniques. Both familial and school-based preventive interventions have proven applicable and promising in high-risk children and adolescents. Perspectives are more systematic identification of risk groups, including youngsters with past or current non affective symptoms who might benefit from depression prevention, long-term evaluation and cross-cultural applications of prevention programs.", "pub_date": "2002-01-01", "authors": ["D Purper-Ouakil", "G Michel", "M-C Mouren-Siméoni"], "journal": "L'Encephale", "doi": "", "source": "pubmed"}

However, the adverse effects of prenatal REEs exposure on children's neurodevelopment are not yet fully recognized. Therefore, we investigated the individual and joint effects of prenatal exposure to 13 REEs on children's neurocognitive development based on 809 mother-child pairs from a large birth cohort in Wuhan, China. Maternal urinary concentrations of 13 REEs were repeatedly measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Children's neurodevelopment [e.g., mental and psychomotor development index (MDI/PDI)] at 24-months was assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development of Chinese Revision. GEE and BKMR models were applied to estimate the individual and joint effects of prenatal REE exposure on child neurodevelopment level. After controlling for typical confounders, we observed that exposure to 9 REEs during the first trimester were significantly associated with decreased MDI scores [βs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) ranging from -2.24 (-3.86 ∼ -0.63) to -1.44 (-2.26∼ -0.26)], and 7 REEs during third trimester were significantly associated decreased PDI scores [β and 95% CIs ranging from -1.95 (-3.19 ∼ -0.71) to -1.25 (-2.34 ∼ -0.16)].

Despite aggressive treatment attempts the prognosis has remained poor. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has been identified as a promising new approach in the treatment of DMG tumors; however, additional targets are urgently required given known tumor heterogeneity and the prospect of antigen escape of this cancer. METHODS: Using cell surface mass spectrometry, we detected high HER2 cell surface protein across a panel of patient-derived DIPG cells, thereby identifying an existing CAR T cell therapy for use in DIPG. Primary human T cells were transduced to express a second-generation HER2 CAR and interrogated for efficacy against patient-derived DIPG cells. RESULTS: HER2 CAR T cells demonstrated potent and antigen-specific cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion when co-cultured with patient-derived DIPG cells. Furthermore, HER2 CAR T cells provided a significant regression in intracranial DIPG xenograft tumors.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of several strategies for Chagas disease screening among Latin American residents living in Spain. The following screening strategies were evaluated: (1) non-screening; (2) screening of the Latin American pregnant women and their newborns; (3) screening also the relatives of the positive pregnant women; (4) screening also the relatives of the negative pregnant women. A cost-utility analysis was carried out to compare the four strategies from two perspectives, the societal and the Spanish National Health System (SNHS). A decision tree representing the clinical evolution of Chagas disease throughout patient's life was built. The strategies were compared through the incremental cost-utility ratio, using euros as cost measurement and quality-adjusted life years as utility measurement. A sensitivity analysis was performed to test the model parameters and their influence on the results. We found the \"Non-screening\" as the most expensive and less effective of the evaluated strategies, from both the societal and the SNHS perspectives. Among the screening evaluated strategies the most efficient was, from both perspectives, to extent the antenatal screening of the Latin American pregnant women and their newborns up to the relatives of the positive women. Several parameters influenced significantly on the sensitivity analyses, particularly the chronic treatment efficacy or the prevalence of Chagas disease. In conclusion, for the general Latin American immigrants living in Spain the most efficient would be to screen the Latin American mothers, their newborns and the close relatives of the mothers with a positive serology.

However, the molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis in pneumonia-induced sepsis are still not fully understood. Thus, this study aimed to find the specific molecular pathways associated with pyroptosis and explore their relationship in pneumonia-induced sepsis. METHODS: First, significant signaling pathways related to pneumonia-induced sepsis were screened by bioinformatics analysis based on GSE48080. The peripheral blood samples from patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis and healthy subjects were collected. Pneumonia-induced sepsis rat models were also established. Then, inflammatory response, pyroptosis, and regulatory T cells (Tregs)/T-helper 17 (Th17), Th1/Th2, and M1/M2 cell ratios in pneumonia-induced sepsis were evaluated. RESULTS: IL-17 signaling pathway was significantly related to pneumonia-induced sepsis by bioinformatics analysis. Compared with healthy groups, the higher of Th17/Treg, Th1/Th2 and M1/M2 cell radios in the patients and sepsis rat model indicated that pneumonia-induced sepsis caused a severe inflammatory response. This result was confirmed by higher levels of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-18) and an inflammation indicator (LDH), as well as pyroptosis occurrence in sepsis. Additionally, the up-regulation of key molecules (HMGB1, RAGE, IL-17A, TRAF6 and NK-κB) in the IL-17 signaling pathway suggested the IL-17 pathway was activated. Moreover, the release of IL-1β and IL-18 and the levels of the molecules (NLRP3, NLRC4, Cleaved caspase-1, and Cleaved GSDMD) associated with caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis were up-regulated in pneumonia-induced sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: As NK-κB activation can promote the development of caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis, these findings suggested that the activation of the IL-17 signaling pathway could promote pyroptosis in pneumonia-induced sepsis.", "pub_date": "2020-06-01", "authors": ["Li-Li Li", "Bing Dai", "Yu-Han Sun", "Ting-Ting Zhang"], "journal": "Annals of translational medicine", "doi": "10.21037/atm-19-1739", "source": "pubmed"}

Numerous anti-Aβ drugs either inhibiting production or aggregation of Aβ or stimulating its clearance have failed to show clinical benefit in large scale AD trials, with β- and γ-secretase inhibitors consistently worsening cognitive and clinical decline. In June 2021, the FDA approved aducanumab, an anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody for early AD based on its ability to reduce brain amyloid plaques, while two other amyloid-clearing antibodies (lecanemab and donanemab) have recently produced encouraging cognitive and clinical results. We reviewed AD trials using PubMed, meeting abstracts and ClinicalTrials.gov and evaluated the effects of such drugs on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ levels, correlating them with cognitive effects. We found that β-secretase and γ-secretase inhibitors produce detrimental cognitive effects by significantly reducing CSF Aβ levels. We speculate that monoclonal antibodies targeting Aβ protofibrils, fibrils or plaques may improve cognitive performance in early AD by increasing soluble Aβ levels through Aβ aggregate disassembly and/or stabilization of existing Aβ monomers.These findings suggest that the real culprit in AD may be decreased levels of soluble monomeric Aβ due to sequestration into brain Aβ aggregates and plaques.", "pub_date": "2022-12-28", "authors": ["Bruno P Imbimbo", "Stefania Ippati", "Mark Watling", "Camillo Imbimbo"], "journal": "Pharmacological research", "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2022.106631", "source": "pubmed"}

This scenario is ideal as CD19 expression is homogeneous and human blood provides a favorable environment for CAR-T cells to thrive and destroy cancer cells (along with normal B cells). Yet, CAR-T cell therapies for solid tumors remain challenged by fewer tumor targets and poor CAR-T cell performances in a hostile tumor microenvironment. For acute myeloid leukemia and childhood solid tumors such as osteosarcoma, the primary treatment is systemic chemotherapy that often falls short of expectation especially for relapsed and refractory conditions. We aim to develop a CAR-T adaptor molecule (CAM)-based therapy that uses a bispecific small-molecule ligand EC17, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated with folic acid, to redirect FITC-specific CAR-T cells against folate receptor (FR)-positive tumors. As previously confirmed in rodents as well as in human clinical studies, EC17 penetrates solid tumors within minutes and is retained due to high affinity for the FR, whereas unbound EC17 rapidly clears from the blood and from receptor-negative tissues. When combined with a rationally designed CAR construct, EC17 CAM was shown to trigger CAR-modified T cell activation and cytolytic activity with a low FR threshold against tumor targets. However, maximal cytolytic potential correlated with (i) functional FR levels (in a semi-log fashion), (ii) the amount of effector cells present, and (iii) tumors' natural sensitivity to T cell mediated killing. In tumor-bearing mice, administration of EC17 CAM was the key to drive CAR-T cell activation, proliferation, and persistence against FR+ pediatric hematologic and solid tumors. In our modeling systems, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was induced under specific conditions, but the risk of severe CRS could be easily mitigated or prevented by applying intermittent dosing and/or dose-titration strategies for the EC17 CAM. Our approach offers the flexibility of antigen control, prevents T cell exhaustion, and provides additional safety mechanisms including rapid reversal of severe CRS with intravenous sodium fluorescein.

The final purpose is to provide customized rehabilitation programs. Methods In this pilot study, four children (8-9 years) were administered a set of standardized tests to evaluate their ability to perform visuoperceptive and visuomotor tasks. Depending on the individual outcomes, two indexes have been computed from the resulting z-scores: η (Eta) that quantifies the visuoperceptive impairment, and μ (Mu) that expresses the alteration in visuomotor coordination. Results A condition of abnormality was evident in each patient: Subjects 1 and 3 suffered mainly from a visuoperceptive alteration (η higher than expected), while Subject 4 had reduced visuomotor coordination (μ higher than expected). Subject 2 showed balanced visuoperceptive and visuomotor impairment. Based on the obtained η and μ values, each child underwent a customized rehabilitation treatment, then they were examined again. At re-test, η or μ turned balanced and z-scores improved in the four patients. Conclusions The Eta/Mu model is effective in detecting the type of damage by quantifying the share of visuoperceptive and visuomotor coordination involvement in dyslexic children, allowing a customized rehabilitative approach.

FINDINGS: 370 (21%) patients had no organ dysfunction, 471 (26%) had one, 457 (25%) had two, and 508 (28%) had three or more. Case fatality rate was 6.4% (115 deaths). PELOD score was significantly higher in non-survivors (mean 31.0 [SE 1.2]) than survivors (9.4 [0.2]; p<0.0001). Calibration (p=0.54) and discrimination (AUC=0.91, SE=0.01) of PELOD and dPELOD (p> or =0.39; AUC> or =0.79) scores were good.

CAR is manufactured to express T cells through various ways such as using retroviruses, transposons and transposase, electroporation, and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Together, it provides flexibility since it recognizes proteins without the need of antigen processing and presentation, can recognize carbohydrates and lipids, and it has been proven to be cost-effective. Despite these benefits however, problems faced by this therapy include unrecognized tumor proteins possibly escaping the system, CAR T cell expression being transient, and the therapy being one of the most expensive cancer drug ever approved. As a result, recent progress has been ongoing where researchers have combined CAR-T cells with natural killer (NK) cells and different cytokines to maximize its efficacy and potency while limiting potential risks such as cytokine release syndrome. Consequently, these cells gained the ability to be universal-being able to be used to treat multiple patients, maintain viability for a longer period, and prevent relapse.", "pub_date": "2021-12-17", "authors": ["Lavina Ery Paula Bangit", "Katarzyna Derwich"], "journal": "Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology", "doi": "10.1089/jayao.2021.0102", "source": "pubmed"}

The increasing prevalence of disease processes that alter body composition including obesity, cachexia, and sarcopenia has generated interest in specific targeted measurement of these metrics to possibly prevent or reduce negative health outcomes. Typical morphomic measurements include the area and density of muscle, bone, vascular calcification, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat on a specific validated axial level in the patient's cross-sectional diagnostic imaging. A distinct advantage of these measurements is that they can be made retrospectively and opportunistically with pre-existing datasets. We provide a narrative review of the current state of art in morphomics, but also consider some potential future directions for this exciting field. Imaging based quantitative assessment of body composition has enormous potential across the breadth and scope of modern clinical practice. From risk stratification to treatment planning, and outcome assessment, all can be enhanced with the use of analytic morphomics. Moreover, it is likely that many new opportunities for personalized medicine will emerge as the field evolves.

Adverse outcomes associated with depression in young people include depression recurrence; the onset of other psychiatric disorders; and wider, protracted impairments in interpersonal, social, educational, and occupational functioning. Thus, prevention and early intervention for depression in young people are priorities. Preventive and early intervention strategies typically target predisposing factors, antecedents, and symptoms of depression. Young people who have a family history of depression, exposure to social stressors (eg, bullying, discordant relationships, or stressful life events), and belong to certain subgroups (eg, having a chronic physical health problem or being a sexual minority) are at especially high risk of depression. Clinical antecedents include depressive symptoms, anxiety, and irritability. Evidence favours indicated prevention and targeted prevention to universal prevention.

However, although many different pyrethroids induce roughly the same symptoms of Parkinsonism, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To find the shared key features among these mechanisms, we focused on 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common and prominent metabolite of most pyrethroids produced via hydrolysis by CEs in mammals. To determine the contribution of 3-PBA to the initiation and progression of PD, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively, and found that 3-PBA not only accumulates in murine brain tissues over time but also further induces PD-like pathologies (increased α-syn and phospho-S129, decreased TH) to the same or even greater extent than the precursor pyrethroid. A before-after study of PET-DAT in the same mice revealed that low concentrations of 3-PBA (0.5 mg/kg) could paradoxically cause DAT to increase (22.46% higher than pre-drug test). The intervention of DAT inhibitors and activators respectively alleviated and enhanced the dopaminergic toxicity of 3-PBA, indicating that 3-PBA interacts with DAT. In particular, low concentrations of 3-PBA increase the DAT, which in turn induces 3-PBA to enter the dopaminergic neurons to exert toxic effects. Finally, we described a mechanism underlying this potential role of 3-PBA in the pathological aggregation of α-syn. Specifically, 3-PBA was found to dysregulate C/EBP β levels and further anomalously activate AEP in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by increased accumulation of pathologically cleaved α-syn (N103 fragments) and accelerated α-syn aggregation. All these results suggest that 3-PBA exposure could mimic the pathological and pathogenetic features of PD, showing that this metabolite is a key pathogenic compound in pyrethroid-related pathological effects and a possible dopamine neurotoxin. Additionally, our findings provide a crucial reference for the primary prevention of PD.", "pub_date": "2022-05-20", "authors": ["Fang Wan", "Ting Yu", "Junjie Hu", "Sijia Yin", "Yunna Li", "Liang Kou", "Xiaosa Chi", "Jiawei Wu", "Yadi Sun", "Qiulu Zhou", "Wenkai Zou", "Zhentao Zhang", "Tao Wang"], "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156027", "source": "pubmed"}

However, clozapine is also associated with a range of adverse effects which restrict its use, including blood dyscrasias, for which haematological monitoring is required. As treatment resistance is recognised earlier in the illness, the question of whether clozapine should be prescribed in children and young people is increasingly important. However, most research to date has been in older, chronic patients, and evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of clozapine in people under age 25 is lacking. The CLEAR (CLozapine in EARly psychosis) trial will assess whether clozapine is more effective than treatment as usual (TAU), at the level of clinical symptoms, patient rated outcomes, quality of life and cost-effectiveness in people below 25 years of age. Additionally, a nested biomarker study will investigate the mechanisms of action of clozapine compared to TAU. METHODS AND DESIGN: This is the protocol of a multi-centre, open label, blind-rated, randomised controlled effectiveness trial of clozapine vs TAU (any other oral antipsychotic monotherapy licenced in the British National Formulary) for 12 weeks in 260 children and young people with TRS (12-24 years old). AIM AND OBJECTIVES: The primary outcome is the change in blind-rated Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores at 12 weeks from baseline. Secondary outcomes include blind-rated Clinical Global Impression, patient-rated outcomes, quality of life, adverse effects, and treatment adherence. Patients will be followed up for 12 months and will be invited to give consent for longer term follow-up using clinical records and potential re-contact for further research. For mechanism of action, change in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers and peripheral inflammatory markers will be measured over 12 weeks. DISCUSSION: The CLEAR trial will contribute knowledge on clozapine effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness compared to standard antipsychotics in young people with TRS, and the results may guide future clinical treatment recommendation for early psychosis.

METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study included pediatric patients admitted to the PICU for infection. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The six scores included the age-adapted pSOFA score, SIRS score, PELOD2 score, Sepsis-2 score, qSOFA score, and PMODS. RESULTS: Of the 5,356 children admitted to the PICU, 9.1% (488) died, and 25.1% (1,342) had basic disease with a mortality rate of 12.7% (171); 65.3% (3,499) of the patients were younger than 2 years, and 59.4% (3,183) were male. The discrimination abilities of the pSOFA and PELOD2 scores were superior to those of the other models. The calibration curves of the pSOFA and PELOD2 scores were consistent between the predictions and observations. Elevated lactate levels were a risk factor for mortality. CONCLUSION: The pSOFA and PELOD2 scores had superior predictive performance for mortality. Given the relative unavailability of items and clinical operability, the pSOFA score should be recommended as an optimal tool for acute organ dysfunction in pediatric sepsis patients.

Many pesticides act to impair mitochondrial function which can lead to exacerbation of neurodegeneration. Triazole fungicides are applied to grain, fruit, and vegetable crops to combat mold and fungi and their use is increasing worldwide. Here, we assessed the in vitro toxicity of two widely used triazole fungicides, propiconazole and tebuconazole, to mitochondria using differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells as an in vitro cell model used in Parkinson's disease research. Cell viability (based on ATP levels), mitochondrial membrane potential, oxidative respiration, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured following fungicide treatments. Cell viability was decreased with 100 μM propiconazole after 24 and 48 h, while tebuconazole required higher doses to affect viability (-200 μM at 24 h). Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was reduced with 50 μM propiconazole after 24 h while 200 μM tebuconazole reduced MMP. Oxidative respiration of SH-SY5Y cells was then measured using a XFe24 Flux analyzer and 100 μM propiconazole reduced basal respiration, oligomycin-induced ATP production, and FCCP-induced maximum respiration by -40-50%, while tebuconazole did not affect mitochondrial bioenergetics at the concentrations tested. Acute exposure to 100 μM propiconazole over 4 h did not immediately affect oxidative respiration in SH-SY5Y cells. ROS were not induced by propiconazole and tebuconazole up to 100 and 300 μM respectively. Based on these results, we focused our lipidomics investigations on SH-SY5Y exposed only to propiconazole, as lipid dysregulation is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Both 50 and 100 μM propiconazole altered the abundance of some ceramides, specifically reducing glucosylceramide non-hydroxyfatty acid-sphingosine (HexCer-NS) and increasing N-stearoyl-phytosphingosine (CerNP). Moreover, a recently discovered bioactive lipid called fatty acid ester of hydroxy fatty acid (FAHFA) was increased 5-fold, hypothesized to be a neuroprotective mechanism that has been demonstrated in other studies of human diseases. Additional lipids reduced in abundance included oxidized phosphatidylcholine (OxPC) and oxidized phosphatidylethanolamine (OxPE). There were no changes in cellular triacylglycerols nor total lipids with exposure to propiconazole.

It is a highly prevalent symptom, challenging to frame into monodimensional pathophysiological mechanisms. As a result, fatigue is often underestimated in the clinical setting and is wrongly considered an unavoidable consequence of ageing. Several potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue have been proposed, including sleep patterns, autonomic nervous system abnormalities and biological complexity. Inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the most promising mechanisms through which malnutrition may cause fatigue. Not surprisingly, fatigue is highly prevalent in inflammatory conditions (e.g. COVID-19 infection). The nutritional status may also represent a critical factor in the development and presentation of fatigue, which may mimic the exhaustion of the individual's metabolic reserves. For example, the insufficient dietary intake of energy and proteins may determine the catabolism of body fat and muscles, disrupt the homeostatic balance and cause the onset of fatigue. It is necessary to conduct research on fatigue. By characterising its pathophysiological mechanisms, it will be possible to (1) support the design and development of targeted interventions, (2) improve the quality of life of many persons by acting on the symptom and (3) reduce the direct and indirect costs of a burdening condition typical of advancing age.

Parents reported 255 (58%) child participants' gender to be female, 184 (41%) male, three (<1%) other, and one (<1%) preferred not to report their child's gender. 400 (90%) children were White and the mean age was 9·20 years (SD 1·79). 85% of families for whom clinicians provided information in the treatment as usual group received CBT. OSI plus therapist support was non-inferior for parent-reported anxiety interference on the CAIS-P (SMD 0·01, 95% CI -0·15 to 0·17; p<0·0001) and all secondary outcomes. The mean difference in QALYs across trial arms approximated to zero, and OSI plus therapist support was associated with lower costs than treatment as usual. OSI plus therapist support was likely to be cost effective under certain scenarios, but uncertainty was high. OSI plus therapist support acceptability was good. No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Digitally augmented intervention brought promising savings without compromising outcomes and as such presents a valuable tool for increasing access to psychological therapies and meeting the demand for treatment of child anxiety problems.

The aim of this paper was to present results and experience gained after the first 1000 cycles of the national In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) program, to offer professional standard of work in our country and to compare it with results obtained in Europe and worldwide. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study prospectively included 1000 women who had undergone national In Vitro Fertilization program from October 2006 until November 2009 at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Clinical Center of Vojvodina, Novi Sad. RESULTS: The analysis included 1000 in vitro fertilization cycles. Male factor infertility was the leading cause (56.9%) followed by tubal factor (45.9%). The classic method of in vitro fertilization constituted 72.3% of all cycles, while intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) method was used in 27.7% of all cycles. The average number of embryos transferred was 2.67. The cycle cancellation rate was 14.10% and the aspiration rate was 94.40%. The clinical pregnancy and live birth rate were 33.41% and 26.78% per embryo transfer respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results in our study showed that in our setting there are far less intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles compared with the European average of 66.5% of all fresh cycles, and that we transferred more embryos on average. Our success rates are comparable with those in other European countries where the clinical pregnancy rates per aspiration and per transfer for in vitro fertilization were 29 and 32.4%, respectively in the period of observation.

The resulting decrease in quality of life contributes markedly to the societal costs of fatigue. Moreover, fatigue is associated with social dysfunction, increased daytime somnolence, impaired working ability, and increased risk of mortality. Fatigue is not related to the severity of the underlying liver fibrosis or dysfunction. In CLD patients, fatigue manifests with both central symptoms, characterised by cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, apathy, and autonomic dysfunction, and peripheral symptoms, characterised by decreased exercise tolerance and reduced physical activity levels. The pathogenesis of fatigue in CLD is multifactorial and involves changes in the brain-liver axis resulting from changes in inflammatory cytokines or the gut microbiome. Numerous interventions have attempted to alleviate fatigue in CLD by improving its central and peripheral manifestations or the underlying liver disease. Currently, however, there are no widely accepted or effective treatments for fatigue in CLD patients.

METHODS: A multicentre retrospective cohort study for the consortium set and a single centre retrospective study for replication set. The consortium set were 1,073 children (age 1 week to 17.9 years) referred over a 15-year period (1996 to 2011), who had an admission diagnosis of MS, referred to paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in six different European centres. The consortium set was split into a development set and validation set to derive the score. The replication set were 134 children with MS (age 2 weeks to 16 years) referred over a 4-year period (2007 to 2011) to PICUs via the Children's Acute Transport Service (CATS), London. RESULTS: A total of 85/1,073 (7.9%) children in the consortium set died. A total of 16/134 (11.9%) children in the replication set died. Children dying in the consortium set had significantly lower base excess, C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet and white cell count, more deranged coagulation and higher lactate than survivors. Paediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) score, Glasgow meningococcal septicaemia prognosis score (GMSPS) and Rotterdam score were also higher. Using the consortium set, a new scoring system using base excess and platelet count at presentation, termed the BEP score, was mathematically developed and validated. BEP predicted mortality with high sensitivity and specificity scores (area under the curve (AUC) in the validation set=0.86 and in the replication set=0.96). In the validation set, BEP score performance (AUC=0.86, confidence interval (CI): 0.80 to 0.91) was better than GMSPS (AUC=0.77, CI: 0.68, 0.85), similar to Rotterdam (AUC=0.87, CI: 0.81 to 0.93) and not as good as PRISM (AUC=0.93, CI: 0.85 to 0.97).

Previous studies have linked both prenatal metal exposures and the gut microbiome to depression in children. However, few, if any, have studied their interacting effect in specific subgroups of children. OBJECTIVES: Using an interpretable machine-learning method, this study investigates whether children with specific combinations of prenatal metals and childhood microbial signatures (cliques or groups of metals and microbes) were more likely to have higher depression scores at 9-11 years of age. METHODS: We leveraged data from a well-characterized pediatric longitudinal birth cohort in Mexico City and its microbiome substudy (n = 112). Eleven metal exposures were measured in maternal whole blood samples in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The gut microbial abundances were measured at 9-11-year-olds using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Depression symptoms were assessed using the Child Depression Index (CDI) t-scores at 9-11 years of age. We used Microbial and Chemical Exposure Analysis (MiCxA), which combines interpretable machine-learning into a regression framework to identify and estimate joint associations of metal-microbial cliques in specific subgroups. Analyses were adjusted for relevant covariates. RESULTS: We identified a subgroup of children (11.6 % of the sample) characterized by a four-component metal-microbial clique that had a significantly high depression score (15.4 % higher than the rest) in late childhood. This metal-microbial clique consisted of high Zinc in the second trimester, low Cobalt in the third trimester, a high abundance of Bacteroides fragilis, a high abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. All combinations of cliques (two-, three-, and four-components) were significantly associated with increased log-transformed t-scored CDI (β = 0.14, 95%CI = [0.05,0.23], P < 0.01 for the four-component clique).

Nonetheless, the pathophysiology of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS)-related chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety, cognitive impairments, and autonomic disturbances is not well understood. OBJECTIVES: The current study aims to delineate whether the remitted phase of RRMS is accompanied by activated immune-inflammatory pathways and if the latter, coupled with erythron variables, explain the chronic fatigue and mood symptoms due to RRMS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We recruited 63 MS patients, 55 in the remitted phase of RRMS and 8 with secondary progressive MS, and 30 healthy controls and assessed erythron variables, and used a bio-plex assay to measure 27 serum cytokines. RESULTS: A significant proportion of the MS patients (46%) displayed activation of the immune-inflammatory response (IRS) and compensatory immune response (CIRS) systems, and T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cytokine profiles. Remitted RRMS patients showed increased chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety, physiosomatic, autonomic, and insomnia scores, which could partly be explained by M1 macrophage, Th1, Th-17, growth factor, and CIRS activation, as well as aberrations in the erythron including lowered hematocrit and hemoglobin levels.

METHOD: Patients were recruited from the department of surgery in a large medical center in Taiwan. In this longitudinal pilot study, the Fatigue Symptom Inventory and fasting blood samples were collected at three assessments (i.e., prior to surgery (T0), three months (T1) and six months (T2) after surgery). Metabolomic profile analysis was used. Multilevel regression and pathway analyses were performed to identify differences in metabolomic profiles between the fatigued and non-fatigued groups. RESULTS: Of the 49 patients, 55.1% (n = 27) were in the fatigue group.

Consumptive coagulopathy and suppression of thrombopoiesis in the bone marrow resulting from immune dysregulation are pathological mechanisms that cause thrombocytopenia in sepsis. Platelet count (PLT) and indices, such as mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and plateletcrit (PCT) are markers of platelet activation and are strongly influenced by platelet morphology and proliferation kinetics. We aimed to study the use of platelet count and indices as predictors of mortality in children with sepsis. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 45 children diagnosed with sepsis on admission at Haji Adam Malik Hospital, Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia, between October and November 2022. Blood samples were drawn upon admission, and platelet count and indices were then determined for all children. Subjects were followed up till discharge from hospital or death. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of platelet parameters was done to determine the area under the curve (AUC), optimal cut-off value, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) in predicting mortality in children with sepsis. Using the cut-off values from ROC curve analysis, the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: MPV, PDW, and PDW/PLT were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors (P=0.04, P=0.02, and P=0.04, respectively). ROC curve analysis showed that PDW had the largest AUC (0.708 [95% CI=0.549-0.866]) with a cut-off value of 14.1%, sensitivity of 63.6%, and specificity of 82.6%. PDW was also the only parameter that significantly affected the outcome of children with sepsis. PDW≥14.1% at admission increases the risk of mortality by 5.7 times.

Teclistamab is a bispecific antibody that binds BCMA and CD3 to redirect T cells to multiple myeloma cells. The aim of the MajesTEC-1 study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of teclistamab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. METHODS: This open-label, single-arm, phase 1 study enrolled patients with multiple myeloma who were relapsed, refractory, or intolerant to established therapies. Teclistamab was administered intravenously (range 0·3-19·2 μg/kg [once every 2 weeks] or 19·2-720 μg/kg [once per week]) or subcutaneously (range 80-3000 μg/kg [once per week]) in different cohorts, with step-up dosing for 38·4 μg/kg or higher doses. The primary objectives were to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (part one) and characterise teclistamab safety and tolerability at the recommended phase 2 dose (part two). Safety was assessed in all patients treated with at least one dose of teclistamab. Efficacy was analysed in response-evaluable patients (ie, patients who received at least one dose of teclistamab and had at least one post-baseline response evaluation). This ongoing trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03145181. FINDINGS: Between June 8, 2017, and March 29, 2021, 219 patients were screened for study inclusion, and 157 patients (median six previous therapy lines) were enrolled and received at least one dose of teclistamab (intravenous n=84; subcutaneous n=73). 40 patients were administered the recommended phase 2 dose, identified as once per week subcutaneous administration of teclistamab at 1500 μg/kg, after 60 μg/kg and 300 μg/kg step-up doses (median follow-up 6·1 months, IQR 3·6-8·2). There were no dose-limiting toxicities at the recommended phase 2 dose in part one. In the 40 patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were cytokine release syndrome in 28 (70%; all grade 1 or 2 events) and neutropenia in 26 (65%) patients (grade 3 or 4 in 16 [40%]). The overall response rate in response-evaluable patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose (n=40) was 65% (95% CI 48-79); 58% achieved a very good partial response or better. At the recommended phase 2 dose, the median duration of response was not reached. 22 (85%) of 26 responders were alive and continuing treatment after 7·1 months' median follow-up (IQR 5·1-9·1). At the recommended phase 2 dose, teclistamab exposure was maintained above target exposure levels, and consistent T-cell activation was reported. INTERPRETATION: Teclistamab is a novel treatment approach for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. At the recommended phase 2 dose, teclistamab showed promising efficacy, with durable responses that deepened over time, and was well tolerated, supporting further clinical development.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term follow-up of patients with idiopathic adhesive capsulitis who were treated conservatively. METHODS: We conducted a long-term follow-up (range 5.5-16 years, mean 9.2 years) of 54 patients suffering from idiopathic adhesive capsulitis. All patients were treated with physical therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RESULTS: An increased statistically significant improvement (P < 0.00001) was found between the first and last visits to the clinic in all measured movement directions: elevation and external and internal rotation. CONCLUSIONS: Conservative treatment (physical therapy and NSAIDs) is a good long-term treatment regimen for idiopathic adhesive capsulitis.", "pub_date": "2004-09-01", "authors": ["Israel Dudkiewicz", "Ariel Oran", "Moshe Salai", "Ram Palti", "Moshe Pritsch"], "journal": "The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ", "doi": "", "source": "pubmed"}

We compared the effectiveness and safety of pharmacopuncture and physiotherapy for AC. METHODS: This pragmatic, randomized, controlled, parallel-group pilot study enrolled patients with limitations of shoulder movement and a numeric rating scale (NRS) score for shoulder pain ≥5 randomized (1:1) to the pharmacopuncture therapy (PPT) and physiotherapy (PT) groups. Treatment sessions were administered twice weekly for 6 weeks, and the participants were followed up for 13 weeks after randomization. The primary outcome was the NRS score for shoulder pain, and the secondary outcomes were the visual analog scale (VAS), Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), range of motion (ROM), patient global impression of change (PGIC), EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), and Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12) scores. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was set as the primary analysis. RESULTS: Among 50 participants, for the primary endpoint (week 7) the PPT group showed a significantly superior improvement in NRS, VAS, SPADI, ROM for flexion, ROM for abduction, and EQ-5D-5L scores. The ROM for extension, ROM for adduction, physical component summary, and patient global impression of change were significantly better in the PPT than in the PT group, and these effects were sustained until week 13. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, PPT showed better effects than PT, confirming the feasibility of a follow-up main study.

Lecanemab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid protofibrils for the treatment of early AD [i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD dementia]. In a recent 18-month phase III trial, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, lecanemab treatment led to reduced brain amyloid burden and significant improvements in cognitive and functional abilities in individuals with early AD. METHODS: An evidence-based patient-level disease simulation model was updated to estimate the long-term health outcomes of lecanemab plus standard of care (SoC) compared to SoC alone in patients with early AD and evidence of brain amyloid burden, using recent phase III trial data and published literature. The disease progression is described by changes in the underlying biomarkers of AD, including measures of amyloid and tau, and their connection to the clinical presentation of the disease assessed through various patient-level scales of cognition and function. RESULTS: Lecanemab treatment was estimated to slow the progression of AD to moderate and severe stages and reduce the time spent in these more advanced states. In individuals with early AD, lecanemab plus SoC was associated with a gain of 0.71 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), a 2.95-year delay in mean time to progression to AD dementia, a reduction of 0.11 years in institutional care, and an additional 1.07 years in community care as shown in the base-case study. Improved health outcomes were demonstrated with lecanemab treatment when initiated earlier based on age, disease severity, or tau pathology, resulting in estimated gains in QALYs ranging from 0.77 to 1.09 years, compared to 0.4 years in the mild AD dementia subset, as shown by the model. CONCLUSION: The study findings demonstrate the potential clinical value of lecanemab for individuals with early AD by slowing down disease progression and prolonging time in earlier stages of disease, which significantly benefits not only patients and caregivers but also society overall.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the possible correlation between fatigue and serum levels of IL-6 in patients on chronic HD. METHODS: One hundred HD patients were assessed for the presence of fatigue using the SF-36 Vitality subscale and were administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the activities of daily living (ADL), and the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). We also calculated the time of recovery after hemodialysis (TIRD) and the number/severity of comorbidities using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Laboratory parameters were measured as well as serum IL-6. RESULTS: Forty-three patients constituted the fatigued group and 57 the nonfatigued group. Age, CCI, BDI, HARS, and TIRD were significantly higher in fatigued patients than in the nonfatigued patients. Conversely, the scores of ADL, IADL, and MMSE were significantly lower in fatigued than in nonfatigued patients. Serum IL-6 levels (pg/mL) were higher in the fatigued group (5.1 ± 3.4) than in the nonfatigued group (1.6 ± 1.5; P < 0.001); serum albumin and creatinine levels were significantly lower. Twenty-six patients (26%) had no symptoms of depression (BDI score <10), and 74 patients (74%) had symptoms of depression (BDI score >9). Patients with a BDI score >9 were older; had a higher CCI; a lower MMSE; a higher TIRD; lower serum albumin, creatinine, and urea levels; and higher serum IL-6 levels. The correlation analyses showed that the score of the SF-36 Vitality subscale was associated with age, dialytic age, TIRD, ADL, IADL, CCI, BDI, HARS, MMSE, serum urea, creatinine, albumin, and IL-6 levels. On multivariate general linear model analyses, with fatigue as the dependent variable and gender as a second factor, BDI and serum IL-6 levels were independently associated with the score of the SF-36 Vitality subscale. A canonical correlation analysis was performed including in the model fatigue, BDI, and biomarkers; the correlation was 0.679 (R(2) = 0.462). Fatigue, BDI, and IL-6 among biomarkers showed the strongest association with the underlying construct (standardized canonical coefficients = -0.989, 0.015, and 0.852, respectively), thus explaining a correlation of IL-6 with both depression and fatigue.

The illness progresses through three phases: freezing, frozen and thawing. A gold standard treatment for adhesive capsulitis is not defined. The goal of any treatment is to reduce pain and restore shoulder movement. OBJECTIVE: Objective of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of gleno-humeral hydrodistension associated with physical therapy in patients with diagnosed adhesive capsulitis comparing the outcomes in term of pain and range of motion in patients with a phase 1 and a phase 2 disease. METHOD: Between January 2022 and April 2023, We evaluated 87 patients with adhesive capsulitis, 47 were excluded for others concomitant pathologies, finally 40 patients were enrolled for the study, of whom 23 had capsulitis in stage 1 and 17 in stage 2. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at 2, 4 and 6 months after infiltration recording range of motion in all planes, pain and functionality scores. RESULTS: A significant improvement was recorded in shoulder range of motion in all planes with the except of extension in both groups. Phase 2 patients were able to regain shoulder range of motion in all planes except internal rotation which was recovered with more difficulty. Pain and functionality scores improved significantly between baseline and follow-up visits. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-assisted hydrodistention of the glenohumeral joint combined with targeted exercise has been successful in improving pain relief, reducing disability, and increasing range of motion in subjects with stage 1 and 2 adhesive capsulitis, especially if diagnosed before phase 2 (when the range of motion is completely reduced).", "pub_date": "2024-06-06", "authors": ["Fabio Vita", "Davide Pederiva", "Roberto Tedeschi", "Paolo Spinnato", "Flavio Origlio", "Cesare Faldini", "Marco Miceli", "Salvatore Massimo Stella", "Stefano Galletti", "Marco Cavallo", "Federico Pilla", "Danilo Donati"], "journal": "Journal of ultrasound", "doi": "10.1007/s40477-024-00891-y", "source": "pubmed"}

The varying microbiological pattern of sepsis warrants the need for researches on the causative organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. The epidemiology of neonatal and pediatric sepsis in Ethiopia is under-research. The objective of this study was to evaluate the burden of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among children suspected of sepsis. METHODS: An institutional-based prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 370 pediatric(age birth-15 years) patients suspected of sepsis at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized hospital from December 2020 to November 2021. Blood samples were collected aseptically and inoculated into Tryptone Soya Broth for culture. The organisms grown were identified by standard microbiological methods and subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing by modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method recommended by Clinical laboratory and standard institute. Methicillin resistance was confirmed using Cefoxitin disk diffusion method. Data entry and analysis were done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 software.

However, it is not known whether having information about these experiences can accurately identify individual children at higher risk of depression. OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which experiencing parental IPV and/or maternal depression before age 12 years is associated with depression at age 18 years at the population and individual level. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a UK population-based birth cohort, which initially recruited pregnant mothers with estimated due dates in 1991 and 1992. Data used in this study were collected from 1991 to 2009. Data analysis was performed from February to March 2022. EXPOSURES: Mother-reported parental IPV was assessed on 8 occasions (child age, 1-11 years). Maternal depression was assessed via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale or by the mother taking medication for depression, as reported by the mother on 8 occasions (child age, 2-12 years). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Depressive symptoms were measured with the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) and Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) when the child was aged 18 years. Binary indicators of a case of depression were derived the cutoff point of 11 points or above for the SMFQ and 12 points or above for the CIS-R. RESULTS: The study included 5029 children (2862 girls [56.9%]; 2167 boys [43.1%]) with a measure of depressive symptoms at age 18 years. IPV only was associated with a 24% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.97-1.59) higher risk of depression at age 18 years, exposure to maternal depression only was associated with a 35% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.11-1.64) higher risk, and exposure to both IPV and maternal depression was associated with a 68% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.34-2.10) higher risk. At the individual level, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.55-0.60) for depression according to the SMFQ and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.55-0.62) for the CIS-R, indicating a 58% to 59% probability (ie, 8%-9% above chance) that a random participant with depression at age 18 years had been exposed to IPV and/or maternal depression compared with a random participant who did not have depression. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, parental IPV and maternal depression were associated with depression in adolescence at the population level.

Dysfunction of the GABAergic/glutamatergic pathways involving inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters such as  γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamine + glutamate pool (Glx) have been implicated in several neurological disorders. This study is aimed to evaluate the potential role of GABA and Glx in the origin of central fatigue in relapse remitting MS (RRMS) patients. METHODS: 24 RRMS patients and 16 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were scanned using Mescher-Garwood point resolved spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS) with a 3 T system to quantify GABA+ and Glx from prefrontal (PFC) and sensorimotor (SMC) cortices. Self-reported fatigue status was measured on all participants using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). RESULTS: RRMS patients had higher fatigue scores relative to HC (p ≤  0.05). Compared to HC, Glx levels in RRMS patients were significantly decreased in SMC (p =  0.04). Significant correlations were found between fatigue scores and GABA+ (r = -0.531, p =  0.008) and Glx (r = 0.511, p =  0.018) in PFC. Physical fatigue was negatively correlated with GABA+ in SMC and PFC (r = -0.428 and -0.472 respectively, p ≤  0.04) and positively with PFC Glx (r = 0.480, p =  0.028).

The first of them attempts to explain them upon the constitutional basis, finding the causes in the genetic conditioning, biological and organic factors. The other one underline a role of the psychological developmental categories. A significant role is ascribed to traumatic childhood mental experiences such as: harassment and sexual abuse, as well as neglect of emotional and developmental needs of a child. About 40-71% of the infirm with the borderline personality admits to have been sexually abused. It was observed that there is a connection between the extent of sexual abuse of an individual in childhood and the intensification of the disorders proper for the borderline personality. One should, however, point out that sexual abuse, although they are regarded as a risk factor, are not seen as specific to the infirm with the borderline personality disorders. Moreover, there is a third direction referred to in the literature, seeking the causes of the occurrence of the borderline personality in a significant influence of social-cultural and environment factors. It was noticed that there is a significant correlation between the social situation and the degree of dissemination of those disorders. The borderline personality disorders are more frequent among the people of the low social status background and with relatively low level of education.

In addition, nutrient deficiencies, such as iron deficiency, are known to impair learning and cause decreased productivity in school-age children, and maternal depressive disorders. School-based nutrition programs and innovations, such as subsidized food (apples, cheese, soy nuts, carrots and broccoli), are an essential immediate need, but long-term solutions lie in adequate incomes for families.

Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit psychoactive substance in the world. It is perceived as a low-risk drug, as it is a plant, although many warnings in the medical literature underlined increased complications of cannabis use. Acute and chronic cannabis use is known to be harmful inducing psychiatric and addictive effects. An increase in the potency of cannabis as defined by a high ratio between the more important components, tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol has been observed for years, which leads to more serious complications. Evidence indicates that both acute and chronic consumptions of cannabis can be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Effects of cannabis use include mood disorders, exacerbation of psychotic disorders in vulnerable people, cannabis use disorders, withdrawal syndrome, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular and respiratory and other diseases. Synthetic cannabinoid has rapidly spread for the last few years; they are chemical substances inducing similar psychoactive effects to cannabis. Although, cannabis users call these substances \"cannabis\", synthetic cannabinoids have different pharmacological properties, which make them dangerous substances leading to more serious complications. Physicians dealing with cannabis users should be aware of these differences between vegetal cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids. Complications somatiques du cannabis.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as an alternative therapy for recurrent C. difficile infection. We aim to perform the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation for C. difficile infection in children and adolescents. Methods: A literature search was performed using variations of the keywords “pediatrics”, “C. difficile infection”, and “fecal microbiota transplantation” in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Google Scholar from inception to 30 June 2022. The resulting 575 articles were independently screened by three authors. Fourteen studies that satisfied the eligibility criteria were included in the meta-analysis. Results: The pooled success rate of FMT in the overall cohort was 86% (95% confidence interval: 77−95%; p < 0.001; I2 = 70%). There were 38 serious adverse events in 36 patients with a pooled rate of 2.0% (95% confidence interval: 0.0−3.0%; p = 0.1; I2 = 0.0%) and 47 adverse events in 45 patients with a pooled rate of 15% (95% confidence interval: 5.0−25.0%; p = 0.02; I2 = 54.0%).

The current review outlines evidence that prenatal depression is associated with offspring cardiometabolic risk and health behaviors. We review evidence of these associations in humans and in nonhuman animals at multiple developmental periods, from the prenatal period (maternal preeclampsia, gestational diabetes), neonatal period (preterm birth, small size at birth), infancy (rapid weight gain), childhood and adolescence (high blood pressure, impaired glucose-insulin homeostasis, unfavorable lipid profiles, abdominal obesity), and into adulthood (diabetes, cardiovascular disease). In addition to these cardiometabolic outcomes, we focus on health behaviors associated with cardiometabolic risk, such as child eating behaviors, diet, physical activity, and sleep health. Our review focuses on child behaviors (e.g., emotional eating, preference for highly palatable foods, short sleep duration) and parenting behaviors (e.g., pressuring child to eat, modeling of health behaviors). These changes in health behaviors may be detected before changes to cardiometabolic outcomes, which may allow for early identification of and prevention for children at risk for poor adult cardiometabolic outcomes. We also discuss the methods of the ongoing Care Project, which is a randomized clinical trial to test whether reducing prenatal maternal depression improves offspring's cardiometabolic health and health behaviors in preschool.

The early diagnosis of septic shock is essential to reduce mortality. High-quality biomarkers can be objectively measured and evaluated as indicators to accurately predict disease diagnosis. However, single-gene prediction efficiency is inadequate; therefore, we identified a risk-score model based on gene signature to elevate predictive efficiency. METHODS: The gene expression profiles of GSE33118 and GSE26440 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. These two datasets were merged, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package in R software. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichments of DEGs were performed. Subsequently, Lasso regression and Boruta feature selection algorithm were combined to identify the hub genes of septic shock. GSE9692 was then subjected to weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify the septic shock-related gene modules. Subsequently, the genes within such modules that matched with septic shock-related DEGs were identified as the hub genes of septic shock. To further understand the function and signaling pathways of hub genes, we performed gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and then used the CIBERSORT tool to analyze the immune cell infiltration pattern of diseases. The diagnostic value of hub genes in septic shock was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and verified using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting in our hospital patients with septic shock.

The standardisation of practice through the proposed National PEWS will rely on robust validation. Therefore, we compared the performance of the National PEWS with six other PEWS currently used in NHS hospitals, for their ability to predict critical care (CC) admission in febrile children attending the emergency department (ED). DESIGN: Retrospective single-centre cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary hospital paediatric ED. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 11 449 eligible febrile ED attendances were identified from the electronic patient record over a 2-year period. Seven PEWS scores were calculated (Alder Hey, Bedside, Bristol, National, Newcastle and Scotland PEWS, and the Paediatric Observation Priority Score, using the worst observations recorded during their ED stay. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was CC admission within 48 hours, the secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) >48 hours and sepsis-related mortality. RESULTS: Of 11 449 febrile children, 134 (1.2%) were admitted to CC within 48 hours of ED presentation, 606 (5.3%) had a hospital LOS >48 hours. 10 (0.09%) children died, 5 (0.04%) were sepsis-related.

Herein, we briefly review the structure of CAR-T and some novel CAR designs, the clinical application of CAR-T cell therapies, as well as the assessment and management of toxicities.", "pub_date": "2018-09-18", "authors": ["Xiao Han", "Yao Wang", "Wei-Dong Han"], "journal": "Chronic diseases and translational medicine", "doi": "10.1016/j.cdtm.2018.08.002", "source": "pubmed"}

Our main goal was to analyze the value of procalcitonin (PCT), C reactive protein (CRP) and lactate in predicting mortality, septic shock and the stratification in children with suspected sepsis PATIENTS AND METHOD: Prospective study in 81 patients. Plasma levels of PCT, CRP and lactate were measured at admission in the pediatric intensive care unit. Patients were categorized into systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. RESULTS: Concentrations of PCT (ng/mL) increased significantly according to the severity of sepsis: 0.36 (0-1.2) for systemic inflammatory response syndrome; 1.96 (0.4-3.5) for sepsis; 7.5 (3.9-11.1) for severe sepsis; and 58.9 (35.1-82.7) for septic shock (P<.001). Compared to CRP and lactate, the area under the ROC curve revealed a good discriminative power of PCT to predict septic shock and mortality, 0.91 (95% CI: 0.83-0.97) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.69-0.88), respectively.

Autologous bone marrow stem cells may be a better cell source and have been studied for the treatment of cerebral palsy because of their functions in tissue repair and the regulation of immunological processes. METHODS: To assess autologous marrow stem cells as a novel treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe cerebral palsy, a total of 10 cerebral palsy patients were enrolled in this clinical study with 24 months follow-up. A total of 10 cerebral palsy patients received autologous bone marrow cells transplantation (4.5 × 10 RESULTS: We recorded the gross motor function measurement scores, manual ability function measurement score, and adverse events up to 24 months post-treatment. The gross motor function measurement scores were significantly higher at month 6 post-treatment compared with the baseline scores and were stable up to 24 months follow-up. The increase in manual ability and communication function measurement scores at 6 months were not significant when compared to the baseline score. All the 10 patients survived and none of the patients experienced any serious adverse events or complications.

However, these new criteria have not been validated in the pediatric population. In this study, we sought to assess the qSOFA score for children with sepsis, who are being treated outside the pediatric intensive care units. The qSOFA criteria were revised and applied to a study population of 89 pediatric patients with sepsis, admitted in a pediatric tertiary referral center from 2006 to 2016. The analysis of prognostic performance of qSOFA score for the prediction of severe sepsis showed a sensitivity of 46% (95% CI, 27-67%), a specificity of 74% (95% CI, 62-85%), a positive predictive value of 43% (95% CI, 34-52%), and a negative predictive value of 77% (95% CI, 71-82%).

Clinical tools are needed to facilitate the diagnosis of impending organ dysfunction in pediatric infection outside of the ICU. What is Known: • One of the major challenges for clinicians is to identify and recognize children with sepsis and impending organ dysfunction, in the emergency and in the pediatric department. • In 2016, members of the Sepsis-3 task force proposed qSOFA, an empirically derived score using simple clinical criteria, to assist clinicians in identifying adult patients with sepsis at risk for poor outcome.

Less well understood is the influence of the pandemic on antidepressant and antipsychotic use among children. This is important, as it is possible that antidepressants and antipsychotics were used as a \"stop-gap\" measure to treat mental health symptoms when in-person access to outpatient care and school-based supportive services was disrupted. Furthermore, antipsychotics and antidepressants have been associated with harm in children and youth. We examined trends in dispensing of these medications two years following the pandemic among children 18 years of age and under in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We conducted a population-based time-series study of antidepressant and antipsychotic medication dispensing to children and adolescents ≤18 years old between September 1, 2014, and March 31, 2022. We measured monthly population-adjusted rates of antidepressant and antipsychotics obtained from the IQVIA Geographic Prescription Monitor (GPM) database. We used structural break analyses to identify the pandemic month(s) when changes in the dispensing of antidepressants and antipsychotics occurred. We used interrupted time series models to quantify changes in dispensing following the structural break and compare observed and expected use of these drugs. RESULTS: Overall, we found higher-than-expected dispensing of antidepressants and antipsychotics in children and youth. Specifically, we observed an immediate step decrease in antidepressant dispensing associated with a structural break in April 2020 (-55.8 units per 1,000 individuals; 95% confidence intervals [CI] CI: -117.4 to 5.8), followed by an increased monthly trend in the rate of antidepressant dispensing of 13.0 units per 1,000 individuals (95% CI: 10.2-15.9). Antidepressant dispensing was consistently greater than predicted from September 2020 onward. Antipsychotic dispensing increased immediately following a June 2020 structural break (26.4 units per 1,000 individuals; 95% CI: 15.8-36.9) and did not change appreciably thereafter. Antipsychotic dispensing was higher than predicted at all time points from June 2020 onward. CONCLUSION: We found higher-than-expected dispensing of antidepressants and antipsychotics in children and youth.

Some, but not all, prior studies suggest that IPV is associated with increased risks of maternal medical conditions such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy which are leading causes of maternal mortality worldwide. We assessed the relation between IPV and risk of preeclampsia among Peruvian women. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a case-control study at two large hospitals in Lima, Peru. Preeclampsia cases were 339 women with pregnancy-induced hypertension and proteinuria (i.e., preeclampsia). Controls were 337 normotensive women. Information concerning women's exposure to physical and emotional violence during pregnancy was collected during in-person interviews conducted after delivery and while patients were in hospital. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from logistic regression models. RESULTS: The prevalence of IPV was 43.1% among cases and 24.3% among controls. Compared with those reporting never exposure to IPV during pregnancy, women reporting any exposure had a 2.4-fold increased risk of preeclampsia (OR=2.4; 95% CI: 1.7-3.3). The association was strengthened slightly after adjusting for maternal age, parity and pre-pregnancy adiposity (OR=2.7; 95% CI: 1.9-3.9). Emotional abuse in the absence of physical violence was associated with a 3.2-fold (95% CI: 2.1-4.9) increased risk of preeclampsia. Emotional and physical abuse during pregnancy was associated with a 1.9-fold increased risk of preeclampsia (95% CI: 1.1-3.5).

Understanding the impact that clinical characteristics may have on bepirovirsen exposure is important for determining efficacious and well-tolerated dosing regimens. This analysis evaluated demographics and clinical characteristics associated with bepirovirsen exposure using a population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis. METHODS: Population PK analyses were conducted using pooled data from three phase 1/2 clinical studies (NCT03020745/NCT02981602/NCT04449029) to construct a structural PK model for bepirovirsen that adequately described plasma concentration-time profiles and identify covariates that affect systemic exposure. The final population PK model was used to simulate bepirovirsen exposure measures to inform exposures at different dose levels and within different subpopulations. RESULTS: Bepirovirsen PK data were well-described by a linear, three-compartment model with first-order absorption and absorption delay. Chronic HBV infection status, body weight, and Asian versus non-Asian race were key covariates included in the final model. Visual inspection of correlation scatter plots confirmed general agreement between observed and predicted data from the studies. In simulations, bepirovirsen systemic exposure was dosed proportionally and predicted to be almost completely washed out by 12 weeks following the final 300-mg dose. Differences in body weight, Asian race, or disease status did not result in clinically relevant differences in exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrated that the linear three-compartmental model accurately described bepirovirsen PK data. The lack of clinically relevant differences seen in exposure indicate that dose adjustments are not recommended for bepirovirsen based on demographics or clinical characteristics.", "pub_date": "2024-05-25", "authors": ["Amir S Youssef", "Mohamed Ismail", "Kelong Han", "Mindy Magee", "Ahmed Nader"], "journal": "Infectious diseases and therapy", "doi": "10.1007/s40121-024-00980-9", "source": "pubmed"}

We investigated the hypothesis that central vestibular pathways are sensitized in VM by measuring self-motion perceptual thresholds in patients and control subjects and by characterizing the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and vestibular and headache symptom severity. VM patients were abnormally sensitive to roll tilt, which co-modulates semicircular canal and otolith organ activity, but not to motions that activate the canals or otolith organs in isolation, implying sensitization of canal-otolith integration. When tilt thresholds were considered together with vestibular symptom severity or VOR dynamics, VM patients segregated into two clusters. Thresholds in one cluster correlated positively with symptoms and with the VOR time constant; thresholds in the second cluster were uniformly low and independent of symptoms and the time constant. The VM threshold abnormality showed a frequency-dependence that paralleled the brain stem velocity storage mechanism. These results support a pathogenic model where vestibular symptoms emanate from the vestibular nuclei, which are sensitized by migraine-related brainstem regions and simultaneously suppressed by inhibitory feedback from the cerebellar nodulus and uvula, the site of canal-otolith integration.

METHODS: We conducted a phase 2b, randomized, investigator-unblinded trial involving participants with chronic HBV infection who were receiving or not receiving nucleoside or nucleotide analogue (NA) therapy. Participants were randomly assigned (in a 3:3:3:1 ratio) to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of bepirovirsen at a dose of 300 mg for 24 weeks (group 1), bepirovirsen at a dose of 300 mg for 12 weeks then 150 mg for 12 weeks (group 2), bepirovirsen at a dose of 300 mg for 12 weeks then placebo for 12 weeks (group 3), or placebo for 12 weeks then bepirovirsen at a dose of 300 mg for 12 weeks (group 4).

After IUI-H the delivery rate was 9.2% in women below 40. After IVF and ICSI the distribution of transfer of one, two, three and four or more embryos was 22.1, 57.3, 19.0 and 1.6%, respectively. Compared with 2005, fewer embryos were replaced per transfer, but significant national differences in practice were apparent. The proportion of singleton, twin and triplet deliveries after IVF and ICSI combined was 79.2, 19.9 and 0.9%, respectively. This gives a total multiple delivery rates of 20.8% compared with 21.8% in 2005 and 22.7% in 2004. IUI-H in women below 40 years of age resulted in 10.6% twin and 0.6% triplet pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous years, the reported number of ART cycles in Europe has increased, pregnancy rates have increased marginally, even though fewer embryos were transferred and the multiple delivery rates have declined.", "pub_date": "2010-06-22", "authors": ["J de Mouzon", "V Goossens", "S Bhattacharya", "J A Castilla", "A P Ferraretti", "V Korsak", "M Kupka", "K G Nygren", "A Nyboe Andersen"], "journal": "Human reproduction (Oxford, England)", "doi": "10.1093/humrep/deq124", "source": "pubmed"}

In this strategy, a patient's own T lymphocytes are genetically reprogrammed to encode a synthetic receptor that binds a tumor antigen, allowing T cells to recognize and kill antigen-expressing cancer cells. As a result of complete and durable responses in individuals who are refractory to standard of care therapy, CAR T cells directed against the CD19 protein have been granted United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as a therapy for treatment of pediatric and young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Human trials of CAR T cells targeting CD19 or B cell maturation antigen in multiple myeloma have also reported early successes. However, a clear and consistently reproducible demonstration of the clinical efficacy of CAR T cells in the setting of solid tumors has not been reported to date. Here, we review the history and status of CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors, potential T cell-intrinsic determinants of response and resistance as well as extrinsic obstacles to the success of this approach for much more prevalent non-hematopoietic malignancies. In addition, we summarize recent strategies and innovations that aim to augment the potency of CAR T cells in the face of multiple immunosuppressive barriers operative within the solid tumor microenvironment. Advances in the field of CAR T cell biology over the coming years in the areas of safety, reliability and efficacy against non-hematopoietic cancers will ultimately determine how transformative adoptive T cell therapy will be in the broader battle against cancer.", "pub_date": "2018-12-03", "authors": ["Kristen B Long", "Regina M Young", "Alina C Boesteanu", "Megan M Davis", "J Joseph Melenhorst", "Simon F Lacey", "David A DeGaramo", "Bruce L Levine", "Joseph A Fraietta"], "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2018.02740", "source": "pubmed"}
