We also monitored clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance. METHOD: We studied 3986 positive blood cultures from children up to 17 years of age at a paediatric hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, using data from medical records before and after the initiatives, to reduce early onset sepsis, were introduced in 2007 and 2008. RESULTS: Bloodstream infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae declined by 42% overall (5.6 to 3.2/100 000) and by 62% in previously healthy children under 36 months of age (24.2 to 9.2/100 000). Early onset sepsis caused by group B streptococcus declined by 60% (0.5 to 0.2/1000 live born children). Bacterial meningitis caused by these bacteria decreased by 70%. Staphylococcus aureus and various Gram-negative bacteria became the dominant pathogens, in both previously healthy children and those with underlying disease. Overall, antimicrobial resistance remained low between the two 5-year study periods. CONCLUSION: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and risk-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus effectively decreased the incidence of bloodstream infections.

METHODS: Single-center, retrospective review of laboratory records of bacteria and fungi, and their susceptibility profiles, isolated from blood and CSF of infants hospitalized in the neonatal unit at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa, from 1st January 2010 to 31st December 2019. Laboratory data on isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were collected. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Corynebacteria and Bacillus spp. were excluded. Patient-level clinical and laboratory data were not available. RESULTS: There were 8,319 significant isolates, giving an infection rate of 14.3/1000 patient-days. Infection rates increased from 12.0 to 15.7/1000 patient-days (estimated average yearly change 0.6[95%CI, 0.5-0.7];p = <0.001). Gram-negative infection rates increased from 4.3 to 10.8/1000 patient-days (estimated average yearly change 0.7[95%CI,0.6-0.8];p = <0.001). The 2 most commonly isolated Gram-negative organisms were Acinetobacter baumannii (44%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (39%). Carbapenem resistance was seen in 31% of all Gram-negatives and increased over time (estimated average yearly change 4.8%[95%CI,4.2%-5.3%];p<0.001). Gram-positive infection rates decreased (estimated average yearly change -0.1[95%CI,-0.2- -0.05];p = <0.001). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram-positive isolated. Rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus decreased from 91% to 55%(estimated average yearly change -2.8%[95%CI,-3.5%-2%],p< 0.001). Rates of fungal isolates decreased (estimated average yearly change -0.06[95%CI,-0.1 --0.02]);p = 0.007). Candida parapsilosis (52%) and Candida albicans (35%) were the most common fungi isolated. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a marked overall increase in rates of blood and/or CSF infections, with an absolute increase in Gram-negative infections observed, replacing Gram-positive and fungal pathogens.

METHODS: A population-based retrospective epidemiological study including infants with GPB-BSI, admitted to the neonatal units at Karolinska University Hospital (KUH). Data were collected from patient records, the Swedish Neonatal Quality Register, the microbiological laboratory at KUH and the Swedish Public Health Agency. RESULTS: We identified 357 infants with GPB-BSI, representing an incidence of 1.47/1000 live births (LB). Group B streptococcus (GBS) was the most common pathogen causing BSI in full-term infants and early-onset sepsis (EOS) (0.20/1000 LB), while coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were predominant in infants born very preterm and in late-onset sepsis (LOS) (0.79/1000 LB). There were no fatal GBS BSI cases, but 10.2% developed meningitis. The GPB case fatality rate was 9.5% and the sepsis fatality rate 2.8%. In GPB-BSI, 1/10 did not have an elevated C-reactive protein level. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) BSI increased during the study period, but no methicillin or vancomycin resistant strains were found. The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rate was highest in CoNS isolates. CONCLUSION: GPB-BSI was four times more common than Gram-negative BSI in neonates but resulted in lower mortality rate. GBS was the most common pathogen in full-term infants and in EOS. CoNS was the most common pathogen in LOS and infants born very preterm, and the AMR rate was high in these isolates.

Existing data support the important role that inflammatory responses play in its pathophysiology, with new findings continuing to be reported. In this narrative review paper, we focus on three dimensions of inflamed depression: risk factors, clinical symptoms, and neurofunctional changes. We aim to answer the following questions: What characteristics most robustly discriminate between inflamed and non-inflamed depression? How can we leverage on these discriminative characteristics to classify inflamed depressed patients? One important point that has emerged is the heterogeneous nature of the relationship between inflammation and depression. Not all inflamed patients are depressed, and not all depressed patients are inflamed. Some risk factors heighten vulnerability to inflamed depression, including childhood adversity, old age, and being female. The inflamed depression subtype has been associated with distinct clinical phenotypes, most robustly with physical symptoms such as sleep problems, changes in appetite, and fatigue. Neurofunctional changes are found in the dopaminergic reward processing pathways.

STUDY DESIGN: After a Phase I double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating trial of oral DMAU for 28-days, 57 healthy male volunteers completed a survey assessing their experience and satisfaction with the regimen. In the trial, participants were randomized to receive up to 4 DMAU capsules daily versus placebo and instructed to ingest them within 30 min of consuming a high fat meal. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were performed, followed by a 6-week recovery phase. Participants were counseled that they could not rely on the drug for contraception. RESULTS: Fifty-seven participants were offered acceptability surveys (39 DMAU, 18 placebo). Most respondents, 80% (45/56), reported satisfaction with the method; 77% (44/57) would recommend it. 54% (31/57), reported that, if available, they would use the method as their primary contraceptive. More respondents reported satisfaction with active DMAU than placebo (87% vs. 67%; p = 0.05).

CONCLUSION: Most participants reported that the study method, daily oral DMAU or placebo, was satisfactory and acceptable. Having to take the drug after a high-fat meal did not detract from acceptability. IMPLICATIONS: Most participants in a 4-week trial of daily DMAU capsules would recommend and use the method.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the possible correlation between fatigue and serum levels of IL-6 in patients on chronic HD. METHODS: One hundred HD patients were assessed for the presence of fatigue using the SF-36 Vitality subscale and were administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the activities of daily living (ADL), and the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). We also calculated the time of recovery after hemodialysis (TIRD) and the number/severity of comorbidities using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Laboratory parameters were measured as well as serum IL-6. RESULTS: Forty-three patients constituted the fatigued group and 57 the nonfatigued group. Age, CCI, BDI, HARS, and TIRD were significantly higher in fatigued patients than in the nonfatigued patients. Conversely, the scores of ADL, IADL, and MMSE were significantly lower in fatigued than in nonfatigued patients. Serum IL-6 levels (pg/mL) were higher in the fatigued group (5.1 ± 3.4) than in the nonfatigued group (1.6 ± 1.5; P < 0.001); serum albumin and creatinine levels were significantly lower. Twenty-six patients (26%) had no symptoms of depression (BDI score <10), and 74 patients (74%) had symptoms of depression (BDI score >9). Patients with a BDI score >9 were older; had a higher CCI; a lower MMSE; a higher TIRD; lower serum albumin, creatinine, and urea levels; and higher serum IL-6 levels. The correlation analyses showed that the score of the SF-36 Vitality subscale was associated with age, dialytic age, TIRD, ADL, IADL, CCI, BDI, HARS, MMSE, serum urea, creatinine, albumin, and IL-6 levels. On multivariate general linear model analyses, with fatigue as the dependent variable and gender as a second factor, BDI and serum IL-6 levels were independently associated with the score of the SF-36 Vitality subscale. A canonical correlation analysis was performed including in the model fatigue, BDI, and biomarkers; the correlation was 0.679 (R(2) = 0.462). Fatigue, BDI, and IL-6 among biomarkers showed the strongest association with the underlying construct (standardized canonical coefficients = -0.989, 0.015, and 0.852, respectively), thus explaining a correlation of IL-6 with both depression and fatigue.

This scenario is ideal as CD19 expression is homogeneous and human blood provides a favorable environment for CAR-T cells to thrive and destroy cancer cells (along with normal B cells). Yet, CAR-T cell therapies for solid tumors remain challenged by fewer tumor targets and poor CAR-T cell performances in a hostile tumor microenvironment. For acute myeloid leukemia and childhood solid tumors such as osteosarcoma, the primary treatment is systemic chemotherapy that often falls short of expectation especially for relapsed and refractory conditions. We aim to develop a CAR-T adaptor molecule (CAM)-based therapy that uses a bispecific small-molecule ligand EC17, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated with folic acid, to redirect FITC-specific CAR-T cells against folate receptor (FR)-positive tumors. As previously confirmed in rodents as well as in human clinical studies, EC17 penetrates solid tumors within minutes and is retained due to high affinity for the FR, whereas unbound EC17 rapidly clears from the blood and from receptor-negative tissues. When combined with a rationally designed CAR construct, EC17 CAM was shown to trigger CAR-modified T cell activation and cytolytic activity with a low FR threshold against tumor targets. However, maximal cytolytic potential correlated with (i) functional FR levels (in a semi-log fashion), (ii) the amount of effector cells present, and (iii) tumors' natural sensitivity to T cell mediated killing. In tumor-bearing mice, administration of EC17 CAM was the key to drive CAR-T cell activation, proliferation, and persistence against FR+ pediatric hematologic and solid tumors. In our modeling systems, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was induced under specific conditions, but the risk of severe CRS could be easily mitigated or prevented by applying intermittent dosing and/or dose-titration strategies for the EC17 CAM. Our approach offers the flexibility of antigen control, prevents T cell exhaustion, and provides additional safety mechanisms including rapid reversal of severe CRS with intravenous sodium fluorescein.

Such correlations may reveal patterns of co-regulation that are indicative of biochemical pathways or common mechanisms of response to a related set of treatments. However, analyses of correlations are usually conducted by either subjective interpretation of the univariate covariance matrix or by applying multivariate modeling techniques, which do not take prior biological knowledge into account. Over-representation analysis (ORA) is a simple method for objectively deciding whether a set of variables of known or suspected biological relevance, such as a gene set or pathway, is more prevalent in a set of variables of interest than we expect by chance. However, ORA is usually applied to a set of variables differentiating a single experimental variable and does not take into account correlations. RESULTS: Over-representation of correlation analysis (ORCA) is a novel combination of ORA and correlation analysis that provides a means to test whether more associations exist between two specific groups of variables than expected by chance. The method is exemplified by application to drug sensitivity and microRNA expression data from a panel of cancer cell lines (NCI60). ORCA highlighted a previously reported correlation between sensitivity to alkylating anticancer agents and topoisomerase inhibitors. We also used this approach to validate microRNA clusters predicted by mRNA correlations. These observations suggest that ORCA has the potential to reveal novel insights from these data, which are not readily apparent using classical ORA.

To test whether progestagen and androgen delivery systems designed to produce steady serum levels will be as effective as other androgen plus progestagen combinations, we compared Norplant II and testosterone (T) transdermal patch to T patch alone on the suppression of spermatogenesis in normal men. Thirty-nine healthy male volunteers (age, 20-45 yr) were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 (n = 19) received two transdermal T patches daily (Testoderm TTS, each patch designed to deliver about 5 mg/d T) alone, and group 2 (n = 20) received combined Norplant II [Jadelle, four capsules delivering approximately 160 microg/d levonorgestrel (LNG)] plus T patch. Neither of these regimens were very effective, with suppression of spermatogenesis to severe oligozoospermia occurring in less than 60% of subjects. We then expanded the study to include two more groups to determine whether T patch or Norplant II was the main factor causing the inadequate suppression of spermatogenesis. Another 29 subjects were randomized to one of two groups. Group 3 (n = 15) received oral LNG (125 microg/d) plus T patch, and group 4 (n = 14) received Norplant II plus T enanthate (TE) injection (100 mg/wk i.m.). After a pretreatment phase of 4 wk, all subjects received treatment for 24 wk, followed by a recovery period of 12-24 wk. Steady-state serum LNG levels (800-1200 pmol/liter) were achieved from wk 3-24 after Norplant II insertion and decreased rapidly after the removal of the implants at wk 24. Trough serum LNG levels after oral LNG administration were at a comparable range (940-1300 pmol/liter). Azoospermia was achieved in 24%, 35%, 33%, and 93%, and severe oligozoospermia (<1 x 10(6)/ml) developed in 24%, 60%, 42%, and 100% of the subjects in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, during treatment phase. All subjects in the Norplant II plus TE groups had persistent sperm concentrations less than 3 x 10(6)/ml from wk 12 until the end of treatment. Concomitant with the marked suppression of spermatogenesis in the Norplant II plus TE group, serum FSH and LH levels were most decreased in this group compared with all other groups. In the T patch-only group, serum SHBG was not suppressed, and total serum T was higher than baseline levels. In the other three groups administered progestagens, serum SHBGs were significantly suppressed, and serum total T remained similar to baseline levels. Serum free T levels were not changed in any group. Except for a suppression of serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, there was no significant change in weight, hematocrit, clinical chemistry, or prostate-specific antigen levels in any of the treatment groups. Although more efficacious than T patch alone, Norplant II or oral LNG plus T patch was not as effective in suppressing spermatogenesis to severe oligo- or azoospermia as in previous reports using oral LNG plus TE. This relative lesser efficacy occurred despite the achievement of serum LNG levels by Norplant II that were equivalent to those reported after administration of oral LNG. Substituting the transdermal T delivery system with TE injections resulted in very effective suppression of sperm output. The difference in spermatogenesis suppression of these combined regimens is likely due to less T delivered by the transdermal patch compared with the TE weekly injections. We conclude that Norplant II implants plus TE 100 mg/wk were very efficient in suppressing spermatogenesis to a level acceptable for contraceptive efficacy. This study demonstrates that the dose or route of administration of androgens is critical for sperm suppression in combined androgen-progestagen regimens for hormonal male contraception.", "pub_date": "2002-08-01", "authors": ["I T Gaw Gonzalo", "R S Swerdloff", "A L Nelson", "B Clevenger", "R Garcia", "N Berman", "C Wang"], "journal": "The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism", "doi": "10.1210/jcem.87.8.8710", "source": "pubmed"}

The main objective is to characterize the emergency presentation of the IBI among children aged younger than 14 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective registry-based cohort study including all patients aged younger than 14 years diagnosed with confirmed IBI (culture or genomic detection using the polymerase chain reaction) was carried out in a paediatric emergency department between 2008 and 2015. Severity criteria were as follows: death, sequelae or admission to the ICU. RESULTS: Of the 223 IBIs reported, 187 (83.9%) corresponded to previously healthy patients (median age=19 months) and 165 (74%) were well appearing. The most common diagnoses were occult bacteraemia [60 (26.9%)] and sepsis [56 (25.1%)]. The most frequent pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae [68 (30.5%)] and Neisseria meningitidis [42 (18.8%)]. Four (1.8) patients died (S. pneumoniae, 2) and eight (3.5%) had sequelae (S. pneumoniae, 5). The diagnoses and clinical characteristics of the children varied significantly depending on the isolated pathogen.

A high prevalence of morbidity and comorbidity is associated with dysthymia: major depression, alcoholism, anxiety and personality disorders are present in the vast majority of sufferers. It is also very unusual for people with dysthymia to not develop superimposed episodes of major depressive disorder, resulting in a longer time to recover and high rates of recurrence and chronicity. Approximately 3.1% of the population have dysthymia including children and adolescents who, like adults, exhibit a higher risk for new episodes of depressive illness if they have this disorder. Children and adolescents with depressive illnesses have higher rates of scholastic failure and school-related problems. Dysthymia can affect every aspect of a person's quality of life including relationships with significant others, earning potential and, most importantly, mental and physical well-being. Available data is not yet sufficient to differentiate dysthymia as a disease entity from the other depressive disorders such as major depression or double depression, or to conclude to what extent dysthymia should be thought of as a personality disorder.

The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7th Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD ± 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged .16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged .15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called 'invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised riskbehaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the \"invisible\" risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively.

Laparoscopy is invasive and often causes a delay in diagnosis and treatment, especially in symptomatic teenagers and young women. Moreover, the visual inspection of the pelvis has major limitations, particularly for the diagnosis of retroperitoneal lesions. It is therefore not surprising that considerable efforts are being made to improve imaging techniques and to evaluate the diagnostic value of potential molecular markers of disease. RECENT FINDINGS: High-resolution transvaginal ultrasonography and, in selected cases, magnetic resonance imaging improve the diagnosis of retroperitoneal pelvic endometriosis as well as the identification of lesions that involve pelvic organs. A variety of serum and endometrial markers are being evaluated for their diagnostic potential, particularly in endometriosis associated infertility. The first gene profiling studies are showing positive results and proteomic technology is being applied to identify novel diagnostic protein expression patterns. SUMMARY: Current imaging techniques, such as transvaginal ultrasonography, are useful to screen the pelvis for the presence of retroperitoneal endometriosis but fail to diagnose peritoneal lesions, small ovarian endometriomas and adhesions.

METHODS: We assessed lifetime use of pesticides selected by mechanism in a case-control study nested in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS). PD was diagnosed by movement disorders specialists. Controls were a stratified random sample of all AHS participants frequency-matched to cases by age, sex, and state at approximately three controls:one case.

The cohort study described here is designed as a large-scale clinical validation of this previous work. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre observational study will prospectively recruit a total of 1445 newborn infants (all gestations)-1084 with suspected early-or late-onset sepsis, and 361 controls-over 4 years. A small volume of whole blood will be collected from infants with suspected sepsis at the time of presentation. This sample will be used for integrated transcriptomic, lipidomic and targeted proteomics profiling. In addition, a subset of samples will be subjected to cellular phenotype and proteomic analyses. A second sample from the same patient will be collected at 24 hours, with an opportunistic sampling for stool culture. For control infants, only one set of blood and stool sample will be collected to coincide with clinical blood sampling. Along with detailed clinical information, blood and stool samples will be analysed and the information will be used to identify and validate the efficacy of immune-metabolic networks in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal sepsis and to identify new host biomarkers for viral sepsis.

These highly aggressive malignancies have a poor prognosis and no specific therapy. The presence of effector immune cells in the damaged brain and vitreous suggests that treatment with anti-human CD20 (hCD20) monoclonal antibodies might be effective. We developed murine models of PCL and PIOL to assess the intracerebral and intraocular antitumor effect of ublituximab, a promising glycoengineered anti-hCD20 mAb with a high affinity for FcγRIIIa (CD16) receptors. METHODS: The murine lymphoma B-cell line A20.IIA-GFP-hCD20 (H-2(d)) was injected into the right cerebral striatum or the vitreous of immunocompetent adult BALB/c mice (H-2(d)). Four to 7 days later, ublituximab was injected intracerebrally or intravitreously into the tumor site. Rituximab was the reference compound. Survival was monitored for injected mice; histopathological and flow cytometric analyses were performed to study tumor growth and T-cell infiltration. RESULTS: Single doses of ublituximab, injected intracerebrally or intravitreously, had a marked antitumor effect, more pronounced than that obtained with the same dose of rituximab in these conditions. The reduction in tumor cells was correlated with an increased proportion of CD8(+) T cells. This efficacy was observed only against lymphoma B cells expressing hCD20.

Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit psychoactive substance in the world. It is perceived as a low-risk drug, as it is a plant, although many warnings in the medical literature underlined increased complications of cannabis use. Acute and chronic cannabis use is known to be harmful inducing psychiatric and addictive effects. An increase in the potency of cannabis as defined by a high ratio between the more important components, tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol has been observed for years, which leads to more serious complications. Evidence indicates that both acute and chronic consumptions of cannabis can be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Effects of cannabis use include mood disorders, exacerbation of psychotic disorders in vulnerable people, cannabis use disorders, withdrawal syndrome, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular and respiratory and other diseases. Synthetic cannabinoid has rapidly spread for the last few years; they are chemical substances inducing similar psychoactive effects to cannabis. Although, cannabis users call these substances \"cannabis\", synthetic cannabinoids have different pharmacological properties, which make them dangerous substances leading to more serious complications. Physicians dealing with cannabis users should be aware of these differences between vegetal cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids. Complications somatiques du cannabis.

Consequently, within the VII Framework Programme, the European Commission funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in eleven European countries, with Sweden as the coordinating centre, and was designed to identify an effective way to promote mental health and reduce suicidality and risk taking behaviours among adolescents. OBJECTIVE: To describe the methodological and field procedures in the SEYLE RCT among adolescents, as well as to present the main characteristics of the recruited sample. METHODS: Analyses were conducted to determine: 1) representativeness of study sites compared to respective national data; 2) response rate of schools and pupils, drop-out rates from baseline to 3 and 12 month follow-up, 3) comparability of samples among the four Intervention Arms; 4) properties of the standard scales employed: Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), World Health Organization Well-Being Scale (WHO-5). RESULTS: Participants at baseline comprised 12,395 adolescents (M/F: 5,529/6,799; mean age=14.9±0.9) from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain.

Dedicated groups of experts and funding are focusing on achieving a functional cure to eradicate this disease by 2030. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: With more than 40 molecules available or under investigation as new treatments for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, none of them is curative so far. Available treatments are effective in suppressing HBV replication and in decreasing the risk of developing cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death, but do not eliminate the virus, and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma remains. Nucleoside/nucleotide analogs are recommended as first-line therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B infection to inhibit viral replication and lower the HBV DNA values, but long-term therapy is usually needed to maintain suppression. Cessation of the therapy in accordance with clinical guidelines can result in virological and clinical relapse. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov , and gray literature sources were searched for articles discussing HBV management and new therapies. RESULTS: With current nucleoside/nucleotide analog therapies, fewer than 5% of patients lose hepatitis B surface antigen after 12 months, which underscores the need for new drugs that can achieve a functional cure. New therapies are being developed, including small interfering RNAs. Bepirovirsen, a modified antisense oligonucleotide, shows promising results and a good safety profile, but requires further exploration in larger number of patients to determine whether a functional cure is possible.

Für die Fremd- und Selbstauskunft des SDQ wurde daher geprüft, ob die von den Beurteilungsquellen wiederholt abgegebenen Verhaltensauskünfte differentielle Stabilität besitzen. Da die Wahrnehmung von Symptomen auch durch den sozialen Kontext beeinflusst wird, wurde zusätzlich exploriert, inwiefern sich die Urteile der Selbst- und Fremdauskunft im Längsschnitt wechselseitig beeinflussen und ob Kinder mit und ohne Lernstörung sowie Jungen und Mädchen als unterschiedlich stark belastet eingeschätzt werden. Dazu wurden 60 Fünft- und Sechstklässler mit und ohne Lernstörung sowie ihre Eltern und Klassenlehrkräfte zu drei Messzeitpunkten auf der weiterführenden Schule befragt. Cross-Lagged-Panel-Analysen zeigten über nahezu alle Skalen hinweg substanzielle Stabilitäten, was dafür spricht, dass Eltern, Kinder und Lehrkräfte in der Lage sind, mit Hilfe des SDQ die stabilen Anteile eines Problemverhaltens von seinen situativen Variationen zu trennen. Interrater-Dependenzen zwischen den abgegebenen Urteilen zeigten sich vor allem von den Erwachsenen zu den Kindern, was den Einfluss der nahen Bezugspersonen auf die Symptomwahrnehmung der Kinder belegt. Unterschiede in Bezug auf Lernstörungen wurden nur für die Skala Hyperaktivität gefunden: Während Eltern von Kindern mit Lernstörung mehr hyperaktive Symptome berichteten, gaben die Kinder bei sich selbst weniger hyperaktive Verhaltensweisen an im Vergleich zu Kindern ohne Lernstörung. Mädchen sahen bei sich mehr emotionale Probleme und Jungen mehr Verhaltensprobleme und weniger prosoziales Verhalten, während im Fremdurteil kaum Geschlechtseffekte gefunden wurden. Die Ergebnisse belegen den Nutzen des SDQ für die Verlaufsmessung in der klinischen Praxis.", "pub_date": "2021-05-01", "authors": ["Janin Brandenburg", "Daniela Hartmann", "Linda Visser", "Christina Schwenck", "Marcus Hasselhorn"], "journal": "Praxis der Kinderpsychologie und Kinderpsychiatrie", "doi": "10.13109/prkk.2021.70.4.282", "source": "pubmed"}

Although in the PASADENA phase 2 study, the primary endpoint (Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) sum of Parts I + II + III) was not met, prasinezumab-treated individuals exhibited slower progression of motor signs than placebo-treated participants (MDS-UPDRS Part III). We report here an exploratory analysis assessing whether prasinezumab showed greater benefits on motor signs progression in prespecified subgroups with faster motor progression. Prasinezumab's potential effects on disease progression were assessed in four prespecified and six exploratory subpopulations of PASADENA: use of monoamine oxidase B inhibitors at baseline (yes versus no); Hoehn and Yahr stage (2 versus 1); rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (yes versus no); data-driven subphenotypes (diffuse malignant versus nondiffuse malignant); age at baseline (≥60 years versus <60 years); sex (male versus female); disease duration (>12 months versus <12 months); age at diagnosis (≥60 years versus <60 years); motor subphenotypes (akinetic-rigid versus tremor-dominant); and motor subphenotypes (postural instability gait dysfunction versus tremor-dominant). In these subpopulations, the effect of prasinezumab on slowing motor signs progression (MDS-UPDRS Part III) was greater in the rapidly progressing subpopulations (for example, participants who were diffuse malignant or taking monoamine oxidase B inhibitors at baseline). This exploratory analysis suggests that, in a trial of 1-year duration, prasinezumab might reduce motor progression to a greater extent in individuals with more rapidly progressing Parkinson's disease.

CMV infection may produce IBD flares refractory to standard therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy and safety of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of CMV colitis in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) flare. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 8 children, with mild to severe UC, positive for CMV PCR in colonic biopsies, received 50-100 ml FMT by nasogastric tube on 5 consecutive days in each of 2 weeks. During the study, the subjects were treated with 5ASA and FMT. Immunosuppressant therapy was withdrawn, when CMV colitis was diagnosed by positive DNA PCR in colonic tissues. The clinical response was defined as a decrease of Paediatric UC Activity Index by ≥20 points. RESULTS: At the 6th week of the study, negative colonic CMV DNA PCR was measured after 10 infusions in 7/8 patients. For one boy, 20 infusions were administered to assess CMV elimination from colonic biopsies. A clinical response was observed in 3/8 patients, with clinical remission in 3/8 patients. Faecal calprotectin decreased significantly in 3 patients. CRP normalized in 2 patients after 6 weeks. No serious adverse effects were observed during and after infusions.

One of the most widely used scoring systems to assess mortality in sepsis or septic shock is Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD-2). However, it requires various laboratory evaluations. A non-invasive, fast and easy method is needed to assess the mortality of children with septic shock at an early stage. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the ability of Vascular Reactivity Index (VRI) compared with PELOD-2 score as a predictor of mortality in children with septic shock based on vascular response to vasoactive agents. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from children aged 1 month to 18 years with septic shock treated in the ER and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the tertiary hospital from 2017 to 2021. The serial haemodynamic data were analysed including Systemic Vascular Resistant Index (SVRI) and the cardiac index from ultrasound cardiac output monitoring device was recorded in the first and sixth hours after the diagnosis of septic shock. The VRI was determined by dividing SVRI/Vasoactive Inotropic Score (ie, accumulated doses of dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, milrinone, vasopressin and norepinephrine). The receiver operating curve was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off point. RESULTS: A total of 68 subjects fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the median age was 54 months with a range of 2-204 months and the mortality rate was 47%. The majority of the patients who died were found in the high cardiac index and low SVRI group (17.6%). Moreover, the optimum cut-off point of VRI was obtained to predict mortality in septic shock of 32.1, with 87.5% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. The AUC for predicting death using VRI was 95% (95% CI 90% to 100%, p<0.001) and PELOD-2 92.6% (95% CI 96.4% to 98.8%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The VRI <32.1 may potentially be used to predict mortality in children with septic shock and its predictive ability is as good as PELOD-2. The assessment of VRI is faster and easier than PELOD-2.", "pub_date": "2022-11-01", "authors": ["Irene Yuniar", "Utami Kurniawati Setianingsih", "Sudung O Pardede", "Muzal Kadim", "Adhi Teguh Perma Iskandar", "Yogi Prawira"], "journal": "BMJ paediatrics open", "doi": "10.1136/bmjpo-2022-001584", "source": "pubmed"}

Spasticity is the most common movement disorder, occurring in 80% of children with cerebral palsy. Movement disorders of cerebral palsy can result in secondary problems, including hip pain or dislocation, balance problems, hand dysfunction, and equinus deformity. Diagnosis of cerebral palsy is primarily clinical, but magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful to confirm brain injury if there is no clear cause for the patient's symptoms. Once cerebral palsy has been diagnosed, an instrument such as the Gross Motor Function Classification System can be used to evaluate severity and treatment response. Treatments for the movement disorders associated with cerebral palsy include intramuscular onabotulinumtoxinA, systemic and intrathecal muscle relaxants, selective dorsal rhizotomy, and physical and occupational therapies.

Primary outcome was resolution of diarrhea at 3 months post-transplantation. A secondary analysis compared charge data associated with FMT by intragastric delivery vs administration by colonoscopy or nasoduodenal tube. RESULTS: A total of 47 intragastric FMT procedures were performed in 42 children (median age 9 years) with recurrent CDI. Response to treatment varied by disease status, with 94% success in previously healthy children, 75% in medically complex children, and 54% in children with inflammatory bowel disease (P = .04).

Despite this success, a fraction of patients' experience relapse after treatment. Relapse is often preceded by recovery of healthy B cells, which suggests loss or dysfunction of CAR T-cells in bone marrow. This site is harder to access, and thus is not monitored as frequently as peripheral blood. Understanding the interplay between B cells, leukemic cells, and CAR T-cells in bone marrow is paramount in ascertaining the causes of lack of response. In this paper, we put forward a mathematical model representing the interaction between constantly renewing B cells, CAR T-cells, and leukemic cells in the bone marrow. Our model accounts for the maturation dynamics of B cells and incorporates effector and memory CAR T-cells. The model provides a plausible description of the dynamics of the various cellular compartments in bone marrow after CAR T infusion. After exploration of the parameter space, we found that the dynamics of CAR T product and disease were independent of the dose injected, initial B-cell load, and leukemia burden.

Estimation of the severity of this syndrome could be a useful additional outcome measure in clinical trials in such units. We aimed to validate the paediatric logistic organ dysfunction (PELOD) score and estimate its validity when recorded daily (dPELOD). METHODS: We did a prospective, observational, multicentre cohort study in seven multidisciplinary, tertiary-care paediatric intensive care units of university-affiliated hospitals (two French, three Canadian, and two Swiss). We included 1806 consecutive patients (median age 24 months; IQR 5-90). PELOD score includes six organ dysfunctions and 12 variables and was recorded daily. For each variable, the most abnormal value each day and during the whole stay were used in calculating the dPELOD and PELOD scores, respectively. Outcome was vital status at discharge. We used Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests to evaluate calibration and areas under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to estimate discrimination. FINDINGS: 370 (21%) patients had no organ dysfunction, 471 (26%) had one, 457 (25%) had two, and 508 (28%) had three or more. Case fatality rate was 6.4% (115 deaths). PELOD score was significantly higher in non-survivors (mean 31.0 [SE 1.2]) than survivors (9.4 [0.2]; p<0.0001). Calibration (p=0.54) and discrimination (AUC=0.91, SE=0.01) of PELOD and dPELOD (p> or =0.39; AUC> or =0.79) scores were good.

The search for molecules interfering with the binding of NTCP and HBV/HDV led to design bulevirtide (BLV). This large polypeptide mimics a region of the pre-S1 HBsAg and blocks viral entry by inhibitory competition. BLV was initially tested in cell cultures, animal models and more recently in Phase I-III human trials (called 'MYRS'). As monotherapy or in combination with peginterferon, BLV is well tolerated and exhibits potent antiviral activity. Plasma viremia significantly declines and/or becomes undetectable in more than 75% of patients treated for >24 weeks. However, serum HBsAg concentrations remain unchanged. No selection of BLV resistance in HBV/HDV has been reported in vivo to date. BLV is administered subcutaneously once daily at doses between 2 and 10 mg. BLV received conditional approval in Europe in 2020 to treat chronic hepatitis delta. The advent of peginterferon lambda or new specific anti-HDV antivirals (lonafarnib, etc.) will open the door for combination therapies with BLV. Since there is no stable reservoir for HDV-RNA within infected hepatocytes, viral clearance might be achieved using antivirals for a minimum timeframe. This is what happens in hepatitis C combining several antivirals, curing nearly all patients treated for 3 months. Clearance of HDV-RNA genomes may occur despite HBV persistence as cccDNA or chromosome integrated HBV-DNA within hepatocytes. This is supported by cases of HDV elimination using BLV despite persistence of serum HBsAg. Another path for HDV cure will derive from achieving HBsAg clearance, the goal of new promising anti-HBV gene therapies (bepirovirsen, etc.). In summary, the advent of BLV has triggered a renovated interest for antiviral therapy in hepatitis delta.

BAN2401-G000-201, a randomized double-blind clinical trial, utilized a Bayesian design with response-adaptive randomization to assess 3 doses across 2 regimens of lecanemab versus placebo in early Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild AD dementia. METHODS: BAN2401-G000-201 aimed to establish the effective dose 90% (ED90), defined as the simplest dose that achieves ≥90% of the maximum treatment effect. The primary endpoint was Bayesian analysis of 12-month clinical change on the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) for the ED90 dose, which required an 80% probability of ≥25% clinical reduction in decline versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints included 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses of brain amyloid reduction using positron emission tomography; clinical decline on ADCOMS, Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14); changes in CSF core biomarkers; and total hippocampal volume (HV) using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: A total of 854 randomized subjects were treated (lecanemab, 609; placebo, 245). At 12 months, the 10-mg/kg biweekly ED90 dose showed a 64% probability to be better than placebo by 25% on ADCOMS, which missed the 80% threshold for the primary outcome. At 18 months, 10-mg/kg biweekly lecanemab reduced brain amyloid (-0.306 SUVr units) while showing a drug-placebo difference in favor of active treatment by 27% and 30% on ADCOMS, 56% and 47% on ADAS-Cog14, and 33% and 26% on CDR-SB versus placebo according to Bayesian and frequentist analyses, respectively. CSF biomarkers were supportive of a treatment effect. Lecanemab was well-tolerated with 9.9% incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema/effusion at 10 mg/kg biweekly. CONCLUSIONS: BAN2401-G000-201 did not meet the 12-month primary endpoint. However, prespecified 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses demonstrated reduction in brain amyloid accompanied by a consistent reduction of clinical decline across several clinical and biomarker endpoints.

Whether exercise is associated with reductions in CVD risk in patients with breast cancer with an elevated CVD risk phenotype is not known. METHODS: Using a prospective design, women (n = 2,973; mean age, 57 years) diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer participating in two registry-based, regional cohort studies, completed a questionnaire that assessed leisure-time recreational physical activity (metabolic equivalent task [MET]-h/wk). The primary end point was the first occurrence of any of the following: new diagnosis of coronary artery disease, heart failure, valve abnormality, arrhythmia, stroke, or CVD death, occurring after study enrollment. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 8.6 years (range, 0.2 to 14.8 years). In multivariable analysis, the incidence of cardiovascular events decreased across increasing total MET-h/wk categories (Ptrend < .001). Compared with < 2 MET-h/wk, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.09) for 2 to 10.9 MET-h/wk, 0.79 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.96) for 11 to 24.5 MET-h/wk, and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.80) for ≥ 24.5 MET-h/wk. Similar trends were observed for the incidence of coronary artery disease and heart failure (P values < .05).

Accordingly, we undertook this systematic review of the literature to examine the evidence on the association between physical and emotional abuse and pregnancy outcomes. STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: A comprehensive literature search was carried out using pertinent key words that would retrieve any research article pertaining to the topic. This was supplemented by cross-referencing of the articles. A total of 296 articles were found; case reports and articles that failed to satisfy the study inclusion criteria were removed and 30 articles were included in the review. RESULTS: Overall, adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight, maternal mortality and infant mortality are significantly more likely among abused than nonabused mothers. Abused pregnant mothers present more often than nonabused mothers with kidney infections, gain less weight during pregnancy, and are more likely to undergo operative delivery. Fetal morbidity, such as low birth weight, preterm delivery, and small size for gestational age are more frequent among abused than nonabused gravidas. The risk for maternal mortality is three times as high for abused mothers. Black abused mothers are 3-4 times as likely to die as their white counterparts. Unmarried victims are also three times as likely to die as married abused mothers. Intimate partner violence is also responsible for increased fetal deaths in affected pregnancies (about 16.0 per 1000). CONCLUSION: Intimate partner violence is often a life-threatening event to both the mother and the fetus. This, in addition to the heightened level of feto-maternal morbidity and mortality, represents clear-cut justification for routine systematic screening for the presence of abuse during pregnancy.", "pub_date": "2004-01-01", "authors": ["Angie Boy", "Hamisu M Salihu"], "journal": "International journal of fertility and women's medicine", "doi": "", "source": "pubmed"}

We assessed the prevalence and risk factors for childhood depression during the Covid-19 lockdown. Methods After 100 days of lockdown, we sent a survey questionnaire by WhatsApp to parents of school-aged children (5-16 years) in Chennai. The Short Mood and Feelings questionnaire was used as an objective screening tool to assess depression, with a score of 12 as the cut-off. Results There were 874 responses. The prevalence of childhood depression was 13.7%. Girls were more likely to be depressed than boys; 11-16-year-olds were more likely to be depressed than 5-10-year-old children. Children who had more than 4 hours online education had a higher likelihood of depression. Those who used a cell phone for online classes had a higher likelihood of depression compared to other devices, such as tabs or laptops. Children who slept less than 8 hours a day had a higher likelihood of depression while those who either did not sleep in the afternoon or slept less than 1 hour had a lower likelihood of depression. Children who were interacting with family over 1 hour per day had a lower likelihood of depression.

Hormonal male contraceptive methods have undergone extensive clinical trials in healthy men and shown to be efficacious, reversible and appear to be well tolerated. RECENT FINDINGS: The success rate of male hormonal contraception using injectable testosterone alone is high and comparable to methods for women. Addition of progestins to androgens improved the rate of suppression of spermatogenesis. Supported by government or nongovernment organizations, current studies aim to find the best combination of testosterone and progestins for effective spermatogenesis suppression and to explore other delivery methods for these hormones. Translation of these advances to widespread use in the developed world will need the manufacturing and marketing skills of the pharmaceutical industry. Availability of male contraceptives to the developing world may require commitments of governmental and nongovernmental agencies. In a time when imbalance of basic resources and population needs are obvious, this may prove to be a very wise investment. SUMMARY: Male hormonal contraception is efficacious, reversible and well tolerated for the target population of younger men in stable relationships. Suppression of spermatogenesis is achieved with a combination of an androgen and a progestin. Partnership with industry will accelerate the marketing of a male hormonal contraceptive. Research is ongoing on selective androgen and progesterone receptor modulators that suppress spermatogenesis, minimize potential adverse events while retaining the androgenic and gonadotropin suppressive actions.", "pub_date": "2010-11-01", "authors": ["Christina Wang", "Ronald S Swerdloff"], "journal": "Current opinion in urology", "doi": "10.1097/MOU.0b013e32833f1b4a", "source": "pubmed"}

STUDY DESIGN: We asked participants from 3 clinical trials of investigational HMC methods-an oral pill (11β-Methyl-19-nortestosterone-17β-dodecylcarbonate, 11β-MNTDC), intramuscular or subcutaneous injection (Dimethandrolone undecanoate), and transdermal gel (Nestorone and testosterone)-to rank their top 3 preferred HMC providers from a list including: men's health doctor (urologist/andrologist), hormonal doctor (endocrinologist), reproductive health doctor (OB/GYN), family planning clinician (community health worker, midwife, nurse practitioner), regular doctor (family medicine/internal medicine), and community pharmacist. We examined preferences based on their rankings and conducted bivariate analyses. Collapsing the various specialists (men's health doctor, hormonal doctor, reproductive health doctor, and family planning clinician) into a single provider type, we examined participant demographics against provider preference (regular doctor, pharmacist, or specialist). RESULTS: Participants across the 3 trials (n = 124) ranked their regular doctor (44%) and community pharmacist (18%) as their most preferred HMC provider; these preferences did not differ significantly by trial and drug formulation. Specialists in family planning (13%), men's health (12%), reproductive health (10%), and hormones (4%) were least frequently ranked as their preferred provider.

Evidence from single-country samples suggests that IPV may be an important risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services, but there is little large-scale evidence on this association. This paper evaluates whether IPV is a risk factor for low utilization of maternal health services in a large cross-country sample, and also compiles evidence on the relative effects of different forms of IPV. METHODS: We analyze the association between intimate partner violence and utilization of maternal health care, using a dataset compiling all Demographic and Health Surveys that report data on intimate partner violence. Using data on 166,685 women observed in 36 countries between 2005 and 2016, we estimate logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between lifetime experience of IPV and utilization of antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery care, and postnatal care. We estimate both unadjusted models and models adjusted for geographic and sociodemographic characteristics that are generally correlated with utilization of maternal health care (including age, education, number of children, wealth status, marital status, and urbanity). RESULTS: Lifetime experience of any IPV is associated with decreased use of maternal health services in a broad sample of births observed in lower and middle-income countries: in particular, the utilization of four or more ANC visits, the number of ANC visits, and the utilization of facility care at birth. This association remains statistically significant even after adjusting for country of residence, subnational region of residence, and additional individual-level covariates; however, there is no statistically significant association between experience of any IPV and postnatal care. The only form of IPV significantly associated with care utilization is physical IPV. CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing physical intimate partner violence show lower levels of utilization of maternal health services in a large sample of developing and middle-income countries. Given that reduced utilization of maternal health services is correlated with maternal and neonatal health outcomes, this pattern suggests that IPV prevention may be an important component of interventions targeting enhanced maternal and neonatal health.", "pub_date": "2021-02-25", "authors": ["Jessica Leight", "Nicholas Wilson"], "journal": "BMC public health", "doi": "10.1186/s12889-021-10447-y", "source": "pubmed"}

Our aim was to develop and validate a non-invasive diagnostic test with a high sensitivity (80% or more) for symptomatic endometriosis patients, without US evidence of endometriosis, since this is the group most in need of a non-invasive test. METHODS: A total of 28 inflammatory and non-inflammatory plasma biomarkers were measured in 353 EDTA plasma samples collected at surgery from 121 controls without endometriosis at laparoscopy and from 232 women with endometriosis (minimal-mild n = 148; moderate-severe n = 84), including 175 women without preoperative US evidence of endometriosis. Surgery was done during menstrual (n = 83), follicular (n = 135) and luteal (n = 135) phases of the menstrual cycle. For analysis, the data were randomly divided into an independent training (n = 235) and a test (n = 118) data set. Statistical analysis was done using univariate and multivariate (logistic regression and least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) approaches in training- and test data set separately to validate our findings. RESULTS: In the training set, two models of four biomarkers (Model 1: annexin V, VEGF, CA-125 and glycodelin; Model 2: annexin V, VEGF, CA-125 and sICAM-1) analysed in plasma, obtained during the menstrual phase, could predict US-negative endometriosis with a high sensitivity (81-90%) and an acceptable specificity (68-81%). The same two models predicted US-negative endometriosis in the independent validation test set with a high sensitivity (82%) and an acceptable specificity (63-75%). CONCLUSIONS: In plasma samples obtained during menstruation, multivariate analysis of four biomarkers (annexin V, VEGF, CA-125 and sICAM-1/or glycodelin) enabled the diagnosis of endometriosis undetectable by US with a sensitivity of 81-90% and a specificity of 63-81% in independent training- and test data set. The next step is to apply these models for preoperative prediction of endometriosis in an independent set of patients with infertility and/or pain without US evidence of endometriosis, scheduled for laparoscopy.", "pub_date": "2012-06-26", "authors": ["A Vodolazkaia", "Y El-Aalamat", "D Popovic", "A Mihalyi", "X Bossuyt", "C M Kyama", "A Fassbender", "A Bokor", "D Schols", "D Huskens", "C Meuleman", "K Peeraer", "C Tomassetti", "O Gevaert", "E Waelkens", "A Kasran", "B De Moor", "T M D'Hooghe"], "journal": "Human reproduction (Oxford, England)", "doi": "10.1093/humrep/des234", "source": "pubmed"}

One of its severe effects is sub-fertility. The exact reason for endometriosis is still unknown and under investigation. Tracking the symptoms is not sufficient for diagnosing the disease. A successful diagnosis can only be made using laparoscopy. During the disease, the amount of some molecules (i.e., proteins, antigens) changes in the blood. Raman spectroscopy provides information about biochemicals without using dyes or external labels. In this study, Raman spectroscopy is used as a non-invasive diagnostic method for endometriosis. The Raman spectra of 94 serum samples acquired from 49 patients and 45 healthy individuals were compared for this study. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), k- Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used in the analysis. According to the results (using 80 measurements for training and 14 measurements for the test set), it was found that kNN-weighted gave the best classification model with sensitivity and specificity values of 80.5% and 89.7%, respectively. Testing the model with unseen data yielded a sensitivity value of 100% and a specificity value of 100%.

METHODS: A total of 20 neonates with sepsis who were hospitalized in the Department of Neonatology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, from January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2020 were enrolled as the sepsis group. Venous blood samples were collected on days 1, 4, and 7 after admission. Ten healthy neonates who underwent physical examination during the same period were enrolled as the control group. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for the metabonomic analysis of serum samples to investigate the change in metabolomics in neonates with sepsis at different time points. RESULTS: On day 1 after admission, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between the sepsis and control groups were mainly involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid skeleton. For the sepsis group, the differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 4 after admission were mainly involved in pyruvate metabolism, and those between days 4 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in the metabolism of cysteine and methionine. The differentially expressed serum metabolites between days 1 and 7 after admission were mainly involved in ascorbic acid metabolism.

Inhibitory activity of cannabinoids (CB) at the CB1 and CB2 receptors centrally and peripherally mediate the therapeutic effects that are wielded for palliation of pain, anxiety, inflammation, and nausea in indicated conditions. Cannabis dependence is also associated with anxiety; however, the direction of causality is unknown, such as whether anxiety disorders lead to cannabis use, or whether cannabis contributes to the development of anxiety disorder. The evidence hints that both may have validity. Here we present a case of cannabis-associated panic attacks following 10 years of chronic cannabis dependence in an individual with no prior psychiatric history. The patient is a 32-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented complaining of five-minute episodes of palpitations, dyspnea, upper extremity paresthesia, subjective tachycardia, and cold diaphoresis occurring in a variety of circumstances for the past two years. His social history was significant for 10 years of smoking marijuana multiple times daily, which he had quit over two years ago. The patient denied past psychiatric history or known anxiety problems. Symptoms were unrelated to activity and only relieved with deep breathing. The episodes were not associated with chest pain, syncope, headache, or emotional triggers. The patient had no family history of cardiac disease or sudden death. The episodes were refractory to the elimination of caffeine, alcohol, or other sugary beverages. The patient had already stopped smoking marijuana when the episodes began. Due to the unpredictable nature of the episodes, the patient reported a growing fear of being in public. On laboratory workup, metabolic and blood panels were within normal limits, as well as thyroid studies. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, and continuous cardiac monitoring revealed no arrhythmias or abnormalities despite the patient indicating multiple triggered events within the duration of monitoring. Echocardiography also showed no abnormalities. With organic cardiac causes of the subjective palpitation episodes ruled out, a psychogenic etiology of the episodes was presumed, and the patient was referred to behavioral health services. In conclusion, cannabis-induced anxiety or panic disorders should be considered in patients with no prior psychiatric history presenting with anxiety-like attacks following a period of cannabis dependence or current use. These patients should be advised to cease cannabis use and referred to behavioral medicine.", "pub_date": "2023-01-25", "authors": ["Grace A Johnson", "Lucy Guerra", "Asa Oxner"], "journal": "Cureus", "doi": "10.7759/cureus.34197", "source": "pubmed"}

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Nine Canadian ICUs. SUBJECTS: Three-hundred fifty-six septic patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical data and plasma levels of biomarkers were collected longitudinally. We used a complementary log-log model to account for the daily mortality risk of each patient until death in ICU/hospital, discharge, or 28 days after admission. The model, which is a versatile version of the Cox model for gaining longitudinal insights, created a composite indicator (the daily hazard of dying) from the \"day 1\" and \"change\" variables of six time-varying biological indicators (cell-free DNA, protein C, platelet count, creatinine, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and lactate) and a set of contextual variables (age, presence of chronic lung disease or previous brain injury, and duration of stay), achieving a high predictive power (conventional area under the curve, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94). Including change variables avoided misleading inferences about the effects of day 1 variables, signifying the importance of the longitudinal approach. We then generated mortality risk profiles that highlight the relative contributions among the time-varying biological indicators to overall mortality risk. The tool was validated in 28 nonseptic patients from the same ICUs who became septic later and was subject to 10-fold cross-validation, achieving similarly high area under the curve.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence, aetiology and outcomes of physician-diagnosed sepsis in hospitalised neonates who had previously been discharged home after delivery in Soweto, South Africa. METHODS: A retrospective review using data abstracted from clinical and laboratory databases identified physician-diagnosed sepsis cases in neonates admitted to the general paediatric wards at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital from January 2015 to September 2016. Neonates with physician-diagnosed sepsis were categorised into two groups based on putative pathogens recovered from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid specimens: (i) culture-confirmed sepsis; and (ii) culture-negative sepsis. RESULTS: Of 1 826 neonatal admissions, 1 025 (56.2%) had physician-diagnosed sepsis: 166 (16.2%) with culture-confirmed sepsis and 859 (83.8%) with culture-negative neonatal sepsis. The commonest pathogens causing culture-confirmed neonatal sepsis were Streptococcus viridans (n=53; 26.5%), S. agalactiae (n=38; 19.0%), and Staphylococcus aureus (n=25; 12.5%). The case fatality rates for culture-confirmed sepsis and culture-negative sepsis were 10.8% (18/166) and 2.6% (22/859), respectively. The odds of death occurring during hospitalisation was 10-fold (95% confidence interval 3.7 - 26.9) higher in neonates with culture-confirmed sepsis compared with culture-negative sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, physician-diagnosed sepsis represents a huge disease burden in previously healthy neonates hospitalised from home.

Several brainstem-regulated physiological processes undergo disruption during neonatal sepsis. Mechanistic knowledge gaps exist at the interplay between metabolism and immune activation to brainstem neural circuits and pertinent physiological functions in neonates. To delineate this association, we induced systemic inflammation either by TLR4 (LPS) or TLR1/2 (PAM3CSK4) ligand administration in postnatal day 5 mice (PD5). Our findings show that LPS and PAM3CSK4 evoke substantial changes in respiration and metabolism. Physiological trade-offs led to hypometabolic-hypothermic responses due to LPS, but not PAM3CSK4, whereas to both TLR ligands blunted respiratory chemoreflexes. Neuroinflammatory pathways modulation in brainstem showed more robust effects in LPS than PAM3CSK4. Brainstem neurons, microglia, and astrocyte gene expression analyses showed unique responses to TLR ligands. PAM3CSK4 did not significantly modulate gene expression changes in GLAST-1 positive brainstem astrocytes. PD5 pups receiving PAM3CSK4 failed to maintain a prolonged metabolic state repression, which correlated to enhanced gasping latency and impaired autoresuscitation during anoxic chemoreflex challenges. In contrast, LPS administered pups showed no significant changes in anoxic chemoreflex. Electrophysiological studies from brainstem slices prepared from pups exposed to either TLR4 or PAM3CSK4 showed compromised transmission between preBötzinger complex and Hypoglossal as an exclusive response to the TLR1/2 ligand. Spatial gene expression analysis demonstrated a region-specific modulation of PAM3CSK4 within the raphe nucleus relative to other anatomical sites evaluated.

METHODS: A rat model of cerebral palsy was established using perinatal anoxia and sensorimotor restriction of hindlimbs during infancy. Kaempferol (1 mg/ kg) was intraperitoneally administered during the neonatal period. RESULTS: Neonatal treatment with kaempferol reduces the impact of the cerebral palsy model on reflex ontogeny and on the maturation of physical features. Impairment of locomotor activity development and motor coordination was found to be attenuated by kaempferol treatment during the neonatal period in rats exposed to cerebral palsy. Neonatal treatment of kaempferol in cerebral palsy rats prevents a substantial reduction in the number of neural precursor cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, an activated microglia profile, and increased proliferation of microglia in the sub-granular zone and in the granular cell layer. Neonatal treatment with kaempferol increases gene expression of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the hippocampus of rats submitted to the cerebral palsy model.

OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the performance of a multicenter network for ultra-rapid genomic diagnosis in a public health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Descriptive feasibility study of critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions treated at 12 Australian hospitals between March 2018 and February 2019, with data collected to May 2019. A formal implementation strategy emphasizing communication and feedback, standardized processes, coordination, distributed leadership, and collective learning was used to facilitate adoption. EXPOSURES: Ultra-rapid exome sequencing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report. The secondary outcomes were the molecular diagnostic yield, the change in clinical management after the ultra-rapid exome sequencing report, the time from hospital admission to the laboratory report, and the proportion of laboratory reports returned prior to death or hospital discharge. RESULTS: The study population included 108 patients with a median age of 28 days (range, 0 days to 17 years); 34% were female; and 57% were from neonatal intensive care units, 33% were from pediatric intensive care units, and 9% were from other hospital wards. The mean time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 3.3 days (95% CI, 3.2-3.5 days) and the median time was 3 days (range, 2-7 days). The mean time from hospital admission to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 17.5 days (95% CI, 14.6-21.1 days) and 93 reports (86%) were issued prior to death or hospital discharge. A molecular diagnosis was established in 55 patients (51%). Eleven diagnoses (20%) resulted from using the following approaches to augment standard exome sequencing analysis: mitochondrial genome sequencing analysis, exome sequencing-based copy number analysis, use of international databases to identify novel gene-disease associations, and additional phenotyping and RNA analysis. In 42 of 55 patients (76%) with a molecular diagnosis and 6 of 53 patients (11%) without a molecular diagnosis, the ultra-rapid exome sequencing result was considered as having influenced clinical management. Targeted treatments were initiated in 12 patients (11%), treatment was redirected toward palliative care in 14 patients (13%), and surveillance for specific complications was initiated in 19 patients (18%).

Although there is uncertainty around causality, cannabis use may be one of a few modifiable risk factors for conversion to psychotic disorders in individuals with Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P) syndromes, characterized by functionally impairing and distressing subthreshold psychotic symptoms. To date, few recommendations beyond abstinence to reduce adverse psychiatric events associated with cannabis use have been made. This narrative review synthesizes existing scientific literature on cannabis' acute psychotomimetic effects and epidemiological associations with psychotic disorders in both CHR-P and healthy individuals to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and practical mental health intervention. There is compelling evidence for cannabis acutely exacerbating psychotic symptoms in CHR-P, but its impact on conversion to psychotic disorder is unclear. Current evidence supports a harm reduction approach in reducing frequency of acute psychotic-like experiences, though whether such interventions decrease CHR-P individuals' risk of conversion to psychotic disorder remains unknown. Specific recommendations include reducing frequency of use, lowering delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol content in favor of cannabidiol-only products, avoiding products with inconsistent potency like edibles, enhancing patient-provider communication about cannabis use and psychotic-like experiences, and utilizing a collaborative and individualized therapeutic approach. Despite uncertainty surrounding cannabis' causal association with psychotic disorders, cautious attempts to reduce acute psychosis risk may benefit CHR-P individuals uninterested in abstinence.

METHOD: Data were extracted from 202 children with ASD participating in a cluster randomized trial of An Individualized Mental Health Intervention for ASD conducted in 29 publicly funded mental health programs. Children with ASD were aged 5 to 13 years (M = 9.1 years, SD = 2.4), and were 84.2% male and 59.9% Latinx. Child ASD and cognitive functioning were determined by standardized assessment. Caregivers reported child psychotropic medication use, behavior problems, ASD symptom severity, mental health symptoms, family demographics, and caregiver strain at the baseline. RESULTS: Nearly half (49.5%) of participants used psychotropic medication(s) within the past 6 months, with stimulants being most commonly reported.

However, it is not known whether having information about these experiences can accurately identify individual children at higher risk of depression. OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which experiencing parental IPV and/or maternal depression before age 12 years is associated with depression at age 18 years at the population and individual level. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a UK population-based birth cohort, which initially recruited pregnant mothers with estimated due dates in 1991 and 1992. Data used in this study were collected from 1991 to 2009. Data analysis was performed from February to March 2022. EXPOSURES: Mother-reported parental IPV was assessed on 8 occasions (child age, 1-11 years). Maternal depression was assessed via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale or by the mother taking medication for depression, as reported by the mother on 8 occasions (child age, 2-12 years). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Depressive symptoms were measured with the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) and Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) when the child was aged 18 years. Binary indicators of a case of depression were derived the cutoff point of 11 points or above for the SMFQ and 12 points or above for the CIS-R. RESULTS: The study included 5029 children (2862 girls [56.9%]; 2167 boys [43.1%]) with a measure of depressive symptoms at age 18 years. IPV only was associated with a 24% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.97-1.59) higher risk of depression at age 18 years, exposure to maternal depression only was associated with a 35% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.11-1.64) higher risk, and exposure to both IPV and maternal depression was associated with a 68% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.34-2.10) higher risk. At the individual level, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.55-0.60) for depression according to the SMFQ and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.55-0.62) for the CIS-R, indicating a 58% to 59% probability (ie, 8%-9% above chance) that a random participant with depression at age 18 years had been exposed to IPV and/or maternal depression compared with a random participant who did not have depression. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, parental IPV and maternal depression were associated with depression in adolescence at the population level. However, estimation of an individual developing depression in adolescence based only on information about IPV or maternal depression is poor.

The purpose of the present study was to identify candidate genes of preterm infants who are susceptible to RSV infection and provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of RSV infection. METHODS: Three datasets (GSE77087, GSE69606 and GSE41374) containing 183 blood samples of RSV infected patients and 33 blood samples of healthy controls from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were downloaded and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out. The function and pathway enrichments were analyzed through Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for DEGs was constructed through Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). The module analysis was performed by Cytoscape software and hub genes were identified. Clinical verification was employed to verify the expression level of top five hub genes among 72 infants including 50 RSV infected patients and 22 non-RSV-infected patients hospitalized in our center. Further, the RSV infected infants with high-expression IFI27 and those with low-expression IFI27 were compared (defined as higher or lower than the median mRNA level). Finally, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) focusing on IFI27 was carried out. RESULTS: Totally, 4028 DEGs were screened out and among which, 131 most significant DEGs were selected. Subsequently, 13 hub genes were identified, and function and pathway enrichments of hub genes mainly were: response to virus, defense response to virus, regulation of viral genome replication and regulation of viral life cycle. Furthermore, IFI27 was confirmed to be the most significantly expressed in clinical verification. Gene sets associated with calcium signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix receptor interaction and so on were significantly enriched when IFI27 was highly expressed. Moreover, high-expression IFI27 was associated with more severe cases (p = 0.041), more requirements of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.034), more frequent hospitalization (p < 0.001) and longer cumulative hospital stay (p = 0.012).

Its accurate and timely diagnosis is hindered by vague symptoms and the urgent necessity for early antibiotic intervention. The gold standard for diagnosing the condition is the identification of a pathogenic organism from normally sterile sites via laboratory testing. However, this method is resource-intensive and cannot be conducted continuously. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to predict the onset of late-onset sepsis (LOS) with good diagnostic value as early as possible using non-invasive biosignal measurements from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) monitors. METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study, we developed a multimodal machine learning algorithm based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure that uses the power spectral density (PSD) of recorded biosignals to predict the onset of LOS. This approach aimed to discern LOS-related pathogenic spectral signatures without labor-intensive manual artifact removal. RESULTS: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic score of 0.810 (95 % CI 0.698-0.922) on the validation dataset. With an optimal operating point, LOS detection had 83 % sensitivity and 73 % specificity. The median early detection was 44 h before clinical suspicion. The results highlighted the additive importance of electrocardiogram and respiratory impedance (RESP) signals in improving predictive accuracy. According to a more detailed analysis, the predictive power arose from the morphology of the electrocardiogram's R-wave and sudden changes in the RESP signal. CONCLUSION: Raw biosignals from NICU monitors, in conjunction with PSD transformation, as input to the CNN, can provide state-of-the-art prediction performance for LOS without the need for artifact removal.

Literature has found reciprocal relations between parental depression and child psychopathology and effects of parental depression on children's cognition. The present study is the first to examine reciprocity among parental depression and child cognition, and pathways to child psychopathology. Structural equation models were conducted using data from the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project, a nationally representative sample of 3,001 economically marginalized families. Measures were collected in four waves from 14 months to 10-11 years. Reciprocal associations emerged between maternal and paternal depression at from 14 months to 5 years. Reciprocal parental depression was associated with greater psychopathology at age 10-11.

The development of innovative and efficacious targeted treatments for fatigue in multiple sclerosis has been marred by the limited knowledge of the underlying mechanisms. One of the hypotheses postulates that multiple sclerosis pathology might cause reduced monoaminergic release in the central nervous system with consequences on motivation, mood and attention. Here, we applied the recently developed Receptor-Enriched Analysis of Functional Connectivity by Targets method to investigate whether patients with high and low fatigue differ in the functional connectivity (FC) of the monoamine circuits in the brain. We recruited 55 patients with multiple sclerosis, which were then classified as highly fatigued or mildly fatigued based on their scores on the cognitive sub-scale of the Modified Fatigue Impact scale. We acquired resting-state functional MRI scans and derived individual maps of connectivity associated with the distribution of the dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin transporters as measured by positron emission tomography. We found that patients with high fatigue present decreased noradrenaline transporter (NAT)-enriched connectivity in several frontal and prefrontal areas when compared to those with lower fatigue. The NAT-enriched FC predicted negatively individual cognitive fatigue scores. Our findings support the idea that alterations in the catecholaminergic functional circuits underlie fatigue in multiple sclerosis and identify the NAT as a putative therapeutic target directed to pathophysiology.", "pub_date": "2021-03-05", "authors": ["Mara Cercignani", "Ottavia Dipasquale", "Iulia Bogdan", "Tiziana Carandini", "James Scott", "Waqar Rashid", "Osama Sabri", "Swen Hesse", "Michael Rullmann", "Leonardo Lopiano", "Mattia Veronese", "Daniel Martins", "Marco Bozzali"], "journal": "Brain communications", "doi": "10.1093/braincomms/fcab023", "source": "pubmed"}

There is no definitive gold standard for its treatment, the primary therapeutic objectives of which are the reduction of pain and the restoration of shoulder range of motion. The aim of our study was to analyze treatment outcomes based on quantitative measures of shoulder function and symptom relief. METHOD: Conducted between January 2022 and April 2023, the research involved 45 patients initially diagnosed with adhesive capsulitis and associated fibroadhesive bursitis. After excluding nine patients for other concomitant pathologies (five for calcific tendinopathy and four for rotator cuff injury), 36 patients were randomized into two groups: one group was treated with glenohumeral hydrodistension, the other with glenohumeral hydrodistension combined with bursal injection. Assessments were conducted at baseline and then 2, 4, and 6 months after treatment, focusing on changes in pain levels, functional scores, and range of motion in all planes. Each group followed a home-based rehabilitation protocol. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in both treatment groups, with the combined hydrodistension and bursal injection group showing notably superior outcomes. Specifically, the range of motion in flexion improved from an initial median of 80° to 155° in the combined treatment group, compared to an increase from 75.5° to 129° in the group treated with hydrodistension alone. This enhancement was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Regarding pain reduction, the combined treatment group demonstrated a dramatic decrease in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, from a baseline median of 7 to 1 at the 6-month follow-up. In contrast, the hydrodistension-only group showed a reduction from 7 to 3, with these differences also proving statistically significant (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided hydrodistension of the glenohumeral joint, if combined with bursal injection and specific exercises, effectively reduces pain, decreases disability, and improves range of motion in patients with second-stage adhesive capsulitis. This study highlights the importance of a combined approach in the management of this complex condition, especially after the histological changes that occurred after COVID-19 and related vaccinations.

Expanding research on the human microbiome now allows ME/CFS-associated pathogens to be studied as interacting members of human microbiome communities. Humans harbor these vast ecosystems of bacteria, viruses and fungi in nearly all tissue and blood. Most well-studied inflammatory conditions are tied to dysbiosis or imbalance of the human microbiome. While gut microbiome dysbiosis has been identified in ME/CFS, microbes and viruses outside the gut can also contribute to the illness. Pathobionts, and their associated proteins/metabolites, often control human metabolism and gene expression in a manner that pushes the body toward a state of illness. Intracellular pathogens, including many associated with ME/CFS, drive microbiome dysbiosis by directly interfering with human transcription, translation, and DNA repair processes. Molecular mimicry between host and pathogen proteins/metabolites further complicates this interference. Other human pathogens disable mitochondria or dysregulate host nervous system signaling. Antibodies and/or clonal T cells identified in patients with ME/CFS are likely activated in response to these persistent microbiome pathogens. Different human pathogens have evolved similar survival mechanisms to disable the host immune response and host metabolic pathways. The metabolic dysfunction driven by these organisms can result in similar clusters of inflammatory symptoms. ME/CFS may be driven by this pathogen-induced dysfunction, with the nature of dysbiosis and symptom presentation varying based on a patient's unique infectious and environmental history.

To learn of the relevant biological pathways involved in fatigue among cancer survivors, the authors tested for an association between fatigue levels and leukocyte gene expression profiles and determined the specific mediating immune cell types. METHODS: A sample of 89 Hispanic/Latino adults aged 60.5 years, 62% of whom were male, who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer and were 2.9 years since diagnosis provided blood for transcriptome profiling and completed a validated measure of fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form). The authors applied genome-wide transcriptional profiling of leukocyte RNA to identify gene expression activity associated with fatigue, tested for the activity of specific transcription factors involved in previously established markers of inflammation and immunologic activation, and identified the specific cell types mediating these transcriptional alterations. RESULTS: In analyses adjusting for demographic and behavioral health risk factors, results linked fatigue with increased activation of B lymphocytes and CD8-positive T cells, as well as several transcription factors involved in immune activation (nuclear factor κB [NF-κB], signal transducer and activator of transcription [STAT], and cAMP responsive element-binding protein [CREB]). Results also replicated several specific genomic effects previously observed in fatigued cancer survivors, including upregulated expression of α-synuclein (SNCA) and hemoglobin subunits (HBA and HBB). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors' heightened fatigue levels may be partially explained by activation of specific immune cell subsets, thereby providing a potential molecular biomarker for clinical interventions targeting the remediation of fatigue.

Sequence analysis of a 159-bp region of Tax extracted from CTCL cells proved to be homologous with the same region prepared from a cell line infected with prototypic HTLV-I. By in situ PCR, Tax has been demonstrated in the lymphocytes infiltrating the skin as well as in the keratinocytes of such patients. Apart from the pathophysiologic and clinical interest of these studies, these observations may have therapeutic implications. In vitro, the proliferation of HTLV-I-transformed cells can be inhibited by antisense to HTLV-I Tax.

However, GSEA cannot examine the enrichment of two gene sets or pathways relative to one another. Here we present Differential Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (DGSEA), an adaptation of GSEA that quantifies the relative enrichment of two gene sets. RESULTS: After validating the method using synthetic data, we demonstrate that DGSEA accurately captures the hypoxia-induced coordinated upregulation of glycolysis and downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation. We also show that DGSEA is more predictive than GSEA of the metabolic state of cancer cell lines, including lactate secretion and intracellular concentrations of lactate and AMP. Finally, we demonstrate the application of DGSEA to generate hypotheses about differential metabolic pathway activity in cellular senescence. Together, these data demonstrate that DGSEA is a novel tool to examine the relative enrichment of gene sets in transcriptomic data.

Oncolytic viral therapy has been evaluated in patients with pediatric gliomas elsewhere in the brain, but data regarding oncolytic viral therapy in patients with DIPG are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, dose-escalation study of DNX-2401, an oncolytic adenovirus that selectively replicates in tumor cells, in patients with newly diagnosed DIPG. The patients received a single virus infusion through a catheter placed in the cerebellar peduncle, followed by radiotherapy. The primary objective was to assess the safety and adverse-event profile of DNX-2401. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of DNX-2401 on overall survival and quality of life, to determine the percentage of patients who have an objective response, and to collect tumor-biopsy and peripheral-blood samples for correlative studies of the molecular features of DIPG and antitumor immune responses. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients, 3 to 18 years of age, with newly diagnosed DIPG received 1×10 CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral infusion of oncolytic virus DNX-2401 followed by radiotherapy in pediatric patients with DIPG resulted in changes in T-cell activity and a reduction in or stabilization of tumor size in some patients but was associated with adverse events.

Recently, a new market for cannabidiol (CBD) products has emerged called \"cannabis light\" or \"cannabis well-being\". In parallel, the experimentation of medical cannabis began on March 26, 2021, for specific indications. Some clinical effects of cannabis have been put forward for medical purposes; however, these are counterbalanced by adverse events (AEs). Data from addictovigilance and international literature on the risks associated with non-medical cannabis use have helped establish exclusion criteria for patients at risk of complications when using medical cannabis (such as those with psychotic disorders, severe cardiovascular, renal, or liver conditions). This also enables the early identification of AEs. Cannabis-based medications are composed of cannabidiol (CBD) and/or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in varying concentrations. We aimed to present the contribution of the addictovigilance data regarding cannabis-related reports to the ongoing French experimentation on cannabis used for medical purposes, to anticipate potential adverse drug reactions in the treated patients. Among the 3164 patients included in the French experimentation, 1186 of them presented at least one AE. Some of the AEs reported in addictovigilance surveys on non-medical cannabis and CBD were observed during the experimentation of medical cannabis such as cardiovascular AEs (myocardial infarction, strokes, transient ischemic attack), psychiatric AEs (suicidal idea and attempt, depression), worsening of epilepsy, cognitive and/or sedative disorders. Given the potential for pharmacodependence of cannabis medications, it seems important for clinicians to gather the addiction history of their patients (past or present), particularly the use of non-medical cannabis (illicit) and non-medical CBD, to prevent and early detect any risk of abuse. The generalization of the use of medical cannabis was adopted and defined in the 2024 Social Security Financing Act. These medications will be accessible to patients by medical prescription for defined indications. Addictovigilance as well as pharmacovigilance monitoring is crucial in this context of continuing to make medical cannabis available in France. Adverse effects of interest will need to be monitored in particular, including neurological disorders (epilepsy exacerbation, cognitive disorders), psychiatric disorders (substance use disorder, suicidal behaviour), and cardiovascular disorders as well as any unexpected AEs.

Disease-modifying therapies targeting T cells have, indeed, shown remarkable efficacy in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. However, these therapies do also target B cells, and a B-cell-depleting monoclonal antibody (ocrelizumab) has recently been approved for MS therapy and is efficacious not only in relapsing forms of MS but also in some patients with primary progressive MS. This suggests that B cells may play a more important role in the pathogenesis of MS than previously appreciated. We review the potential roles of B cells, which are the precursors of antibody-secreting plasma cells in the pathogenesis of MS. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the characteristics and clinical data for the four monoclonal antibodies (ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, rituximab, and ublituximab) that have been approved, are currently been used off-label or are being investigated as treatments for MS. These antibodies all target the cluster of differentiation (CD)-20 molecule and bind to distinct or overlapping epitopes on B cells and a subset of T cells that express CD20. This leads to B-cell depletion and, possibly, to depletion of CD20-positive T cells.

To mitigate these risks, teclistamab is initiated using step-up doses. This article examines safety event rates following the implementation of a 2-day separation between step-up doses at one institution to streamline patient care.MethodsThis was a retrospective, single-center study encompassing all patients who received teclistamab within a 1-year period. The primary endpoint was the overall incidence of CRS and ICANS. Secondary endpoints included hospital length of stay, hematological toxicities, infection rates, among other adverse events.ResultsA total of 27 patients were included in the analysis and stratified into accelerated (days 1,3,5) or standard (days 1,4,7) dosing groups. CRS occurred in 48% (11) of patients for the accelerated dosing and 50% (2) for the standard dosing group.

Lecanemab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid protofibrils for the treatment of early AD. In the phase II BAN2401-G000-201 trial (NCT01767311), lecanemab reduced amyloid accumulated in the brain and slowed progression on key global and cognitive scales evaluating efficacy after 18 months of treatment. METHODS: A disease simulation model was used to predict the long-term clinical outcomes of lecanemab for patients with early AD [i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and mild AD dementia] on the basis of BAN2401-G000-201 trial data and published literature. The model captures the pathophysiology and management of AD, with a focus on simulating the effects of disease modification and early intervention on disease progression. The model compares lecanemab in addition to standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone. RESULTS: Lecanemab treatment was estimated to slow the rate of disease progression, resulting in an extended duration of MCI due to AD and mild AD dementia and shortened duration in moderate and severe AD dementia. The mean time to mild, moderate, and severe AD dementia was longer for patients in the lecanemab + SoC group than for patients in the SoC group by 2.51, 3.13, and 2.34 years, respectively. On base-case analysis, lecanemab was associated with 0.73 incremental life years (LY) and 0.75 incremental quality-adjusted LYs (QALY), and the caregiver QALYs lost was reduced by 0.03 years. The model also predicted a lower lifetime probability of admission to institutional care in lecanemab + SoC versus SoC group (25% versus 31%).

An established measure of inter-class deviation, the enrichment score, is usually computed using a weighted running sum statistic over the whole set of gene symbols. Due to the lack of analytic expressions the significance of enrichment scores is determined using a non-parametric estimation of their null distribution by permuting the phenotype labels of the probed patients. Accordingly, GSEA is a time-consuming task due to the large number of required permutations to accurately estimate the nominal p-value - a circumstance that is even more pronounced during multiple hypothesis testing since its estimate is lower-bounded by the inverse number of samples in permutation space. RESULTS: We present rapidGSEA - a software suite consisting of two tools for facilitating permutation-based GSEA: cudaGSEA and ompGSEA. cudaGSEA is a CUDA-accelerated tool using fine-grained parallelization schemes on massively parallel architectures while ompGSEA is a coarse-grained multi-threaded tool for multi-core CPUs. Nominal p-value estimation of 4,725 gene sets on a data set consisting of 20,639 unique gene symbols and 200 patients (183 cases + 17 controls) each probing one million permutations takes 19 hours on a Xeon CPU and less than one hour on a GeForce Titan X GPU while the established GSEA tool from the Broad Institute (broadGSEA) takes roughly 13 days. CONCLUSION: cudaGSEA outperforms broadGSEA by around two orders-of-magnitude on a single Tesla K40c or GeForce Titan X GPU. ompGSEA provides around one order-of-magnitude speedup to broadGSEA on a standard Xeon CPU. The rapidGSEA suite is open-source software and can be downloaded at https://github.com/gravitino/cudaGSEA as standalone application or package for the R framework.", "pub_date": "2016-09-23", "authors": ["Christian Hundt", "Andreas Hildebrandt", "Bertil Schmidt"], "journal": "BMC bioinformatics", "doi": "10.1186/s12859-016-1244-x", "source": "pubmed"}

We examined the association between maternal and paternal depression, and the timing of their depression (before or after the child's birth) and outcomes for the child including incidence of child depression and poor educational attainment. METHODS: A linked routine data cohort study linking General Practitioner(GP), hospital and education records of young people (aged 0 to 30 years) in Wales. Parental and child diagnosis of depression was identified from GP data. Regression analysis examined the association of maternal and paternal depression with time to diagnosis of depression in the child and odds of attaining educational milestones. OUTCOMES: In adjusted models, the relative risk of offspring developing depression was 1.22 if the mother had depression before the child was born, 1.55 if the mother had depression after the child was born and 1.73 if she had depression both before and after the child was born (chronic depression), compared to those were there was no maternal depression history. For achieving milestones at end of primary school, odds were 0.92, 0.88 and 0.79 respectively. Association of depression in the child was similar if the male living in the household had depression with risk ratios of 1.24 (before), 1.43 (after) and 1.27 (before and after) for child diagnosed depression and 0.85, 0.79 and 0.74 for achieving age 11 milestones. INTERPRETATION: Children who live with a parent who has depression are more likely to develop depression and not achieve educational milestones, compared to children who live with a parent who has a history of depression (but no active depression in child's lifetime) and compared to those with no depression. This finding suggests that working closely with families where depression (particularly chronic depression) is present in either parent and treating parental depression to remission is likely to have long-term benefits for children's mental health and educational attainment.", "pub_date": "2021-11-17", "authors": ["Sinead Brophy", "Charlotte Todd", "Muhammad A Rahman", "Natasha Kennedy", "Frances Rice"], "journal": "PloS one", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0258966", "source": "pubmed"}

Evidence-based psychological treatments for common childhood mental health disorders (anxiety, depression and disruptive behaviour disorders) have not been systematically evaluated in young people with epilepsy despite their high prevalence in this population. The aim of this multi-site randomised controlled trial is to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of adding a modular psychological intervention to usual care for the mental health disorders in comparison to assessment-enhanced usual care alone. METHODS: In total, 334 participants aged 3-18 years attending epilepsy services will be screened for mental health disorders with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the diagnostic Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA). Those identified as having a mental health disorder and consenting to the trial will be randomised to either receive up to 22 sessions of the modular psychological intervention (MATCH-ADTC) delivered over the telephone over 6 months by non-mental health professionals in addition to usual care or to assessment-enhanced usual care alone. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6 months and 12 months post-randomisation. It is hypothesised that MATCH-ADTC plus usual care will be superior to assessment-enhanced usual care in improving emotional and behavioural symptoms. The primary outcome is the SDQ reported by parents at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include parent-reported mental health measures such as the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale, quality of life measures such as the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory and physical health measures such as the Hague Seizure Severity Scale. Outcome assessors will be blinded to group assignment. Qualitative process evaluations and a health economic evaluation will also be completed. DISCUSSION: This trial aims to determine whether a systematic and integrated approach to the identification and treatment of mental health disorders in children and young people with epilepsy is clinically and cost-effective. The findings will contribute to policies and practice with regard to addressing mental health needs in children and young people with other long-term conditions.

We assessed population-based incidence and outcomes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis in children in Switzerland. METHODS: We did a multicentre, prospective, cohort study at ten paediatric hospitals in Switzerland. We included neonates and children younger than 17 years with blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis. Children were eligible if they met criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome-according to 2005 paediatric consensus definition- at the time of blood culture sampling. Incidence was calculated by dividing the number of annual sepsis episodes in the study for the years 2012-15 by the end-of-year resident paediatric population in Switzerland. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in the first 30 days after sepsis onset. FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2011, and Dec 31, 2015, we enrolled 1096 children to our study. Of 1181 episodes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis, 382 (32%) occurred in 379 previously healthy children, 402 (34%) in 391 neonates, and 397 (34%) in 341 children with comorbidities. Incidence was 25·1 cases per 100 000 (95% CI 23·8-26·4) in children and 146·0 cases per 100 000 (133·2-159·6) in neonates. Central line-associated bloodstream infections and primary bloodstream infections accounted for 569 (48%) of 1181 episodes, and organ dysfunction was present in 455 (39%) of 1181 episodes. Escherichia coli (242 of 1181 [20%]), Staphylococcus aureus (177 of 1181 [15%]), coagulase-negative staphylococci (135 of 1181 [11%]), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (118 of 1181 [10%]) were the most prevalent pathogens in our study, accounting for 57% of episodes. The overall case-fatality ratio was 7% (82 of 1181 episodes; 95% CI 5·6-8·6), and it was higher in neonates (11%, 45 of 402 episodes; 8·4-14·8; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 4·41, 95% CI 1·75-11·1) and children with comorbidities (7%, 27 of 397 episodes; 4·6-9·9; OR 4·97, 1·84-13·4) compared with previously healthy children (3%, ten of 382 episodes; 1·3-4·9). The case-fatality ratio was 1% (five of 726 episodes [95% CI 0·3-1·7]) for children without organ dysfunction, which increased to 17% (77 of 455 episodes [13·7-20·8]) when organ dysfunction was present (adjusted OR 4·84, 95% CI 1·40-16·7). INTERPRETATION: The burden of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis on child health remains considerable. We recorded key differences in predominant organisms, severity, and outcome between neonates, previously healthy children, and children with comorbidities. Although for most episodes of blood culture-proven bacterial sepsis, no organ dysfunction was seen, presence of organ dysfunction was strongly associated with mortality.

However, associations between adolescent cannabis use, depression and anxiety disorders are inconsistently reported in longitudinal samples. AIMS: To study associations of adolescent cannabis use with depression and anxiety disorders. METHOD: We used data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986, linked to nationwide registers, to study the association between adolescent cannabis use and depression and anxiety disorders until 33 years of age (until 2018). RESULTS: We included 6325 participants (48.8% male) in the analyses; 352 (5.6%) participants reported cannabis use until 15-16 years of age.

It has been posited that characteristics of SMWGD's substance use companions (i.e., sexual orientation, gender identity) may influence their own use, but few studies have tested this. The current study aimed to examine whether quantity and consequences of substance use varied based on sexual orientations and gender identities (SOGI) of SMWGD's substance use companions. METHODS: We utilized a 30-day ecological momentary assessment study of substance use among a sample of 429 SMWGD. We examined event-level associations between characteristics of substance use companions and quantity and consequences of substance use. RESULTS: When SMWGD used alcohol/cannabis with most SOGI groups, they engaged in heavier drinking and cannabis use. Drinking with heterosexual men and SMW was associated with more drinking consequences. Drinking in settings with more SOGI groups and with both LGBTQ+ and heterosexual individuals was associated with heavier drinking and more consequences. Many contextual aspects of cannabis use settings predicted an increased likelihood of alcohol and cannabis co-use, while few contextual aspects of drinking settings were associated with co-use. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that SMWGD engage in heavier substance use when individuals from a range of SOGI groups are present, highlighting that heavy alcohol and cannabis use is not limited to use with SMW and nonbinary individuals. Drinking in setting with more SOGI groups present (e.g., parties and bars) appears to be associated with particularly heavy drinking and consequences.", "pub_date": "2023-12-10", "authors": ["Christina Dyar", "Emily R Dworkin", "Debra Kaysen"], "journal": "Addictive behaviors", "doi": "10.1016/j.addbeh.2023.107935", "source": "pubmed"}

Originally GSEA was developed for interpreting microarray gene expression data, but it can be applied to any sorted list of genes. Given the gene list and an arbitrary biological category, GSEA evaluates whether the genes of the considered category are randomly distributed or accumulated on top or bottom of the list. Usually, significance scores (p-values) of GSEA are computed by nonparametric permutation tests, a time consuming procedure that yields only estimates of the p-values. RESULTS: We present a novel dynamic programming algorithm for calculating exact significance values of unweighted Gene Set Enrichment Analyses. Our algorithm avoids typical problems of nonparametric permutation tests, as varying findings in different runs caused by the random sampling procedure. Another advantage of the presented dynamic programming algorithm is its runtime and memory efficiency.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that occupational exposure to pesticides (e.g., dieldrin, paraquat, rotenone, maneb, and ziram) is associated with a higher risk of developing PD in susceptible populations. Within dopaminergic neurons, environmental chemicals can have an array of adverse effects resulting in cell death, such as aberrant redox cycling and oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, unfolded protein response, ubiquitin-proteome system dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and metabolic disruption. More recently, our understanding of how pesticides affect cells of the central nervous system has been strengthened by computational biology. New insight has been gained about transcriptional and proteomic networks, and the metabolic pathways perturbed by pesticides. These networks and cell signaling pathways constitute potential therapeutic targets for intervention to slow or mitigate neurodegenerative diseases. Here we review the epidemiological evidence that supports a role for specific pesticides in the etiology of PD and identify molecular profiles amongst these pesticides that may contribute to the disease. Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, these transcripts were compared to those regulated by the PD-associated neurotoxicant MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine). While many transcripts are already established as those related to PD (alpha-synuclein, caspases, leucine rich repeat kinase 2, and parkin2), lesser studied targets have emerged as \"pesticide/PD-associated transcripts\" [e.g., phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class C (Pigc), allograft inflammatory factor 1 (Aif1), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3, and DNA damage inducible transcript 4]. We also compared pesticide-regulated genes to a recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in PD which revealed new genetic mutant alleles; the pesticides under review regulated the expression of many of these genes (e.g., ELOVL fatty acid elongase 7, ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a1, and bridging integrator 3). The significance is that these proteins may contribute to pesticide-related increases in PD risk. This review collates information on transcriptome responses to PD-associated pesticides to develop a mechanistic framework for quantifying PD risk with exposures.", "pub_date": "2019-01-25", "authors": ["Fangjie Cao", "Christopher L Souders Ii", "Veronica Perez-Rodriguez", "Christopher J Martyniuk"], "journal": "Frontiers in genetics", "doi": "10.3389/fgene.2018.00701", "source": "pubmed"}

Higher maternal average urinary concentrations of europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), dysprosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), and ytterbium (Yb) across three trimesters, either individually or jointly, were significantly associated with lower BW-for-GA Z-scores and higher odds of small for gestational age (SGA) [β = -0.092; 95 % confidence interval (CI): -0.149, -0.035 for BW-for-GA Z-scores, and odds ratio = 1.60; 95 % CI: 1.14, 2.24 for SGA involved in each unit increase in weighted quantile sum index of REEs mixture]. When stratified by cord blood vitamin D levels, the associations mentioned above persisted in participants with relatively low vitamin D levels (<13.94 μg/L, the first tertile of distribution), but not among those with relatively high levels (≥13.94 μg/L) (all p-values for interaction < 0.05). The mediation analyses taking account of exposure-mediator interaction showed that the relationships between REEs (as individual and mixture) exposure and lower BW-for-GA were partly mediated through decreasing cord blood vitamin D levels. The proportions mediated by cord blood vitamin D levels were 24.48 % for BW-for-GA Z-scores and 29.05 % for SGA corresponding to the REEs mixture exposure. Conclusively, our study revealed that prenatal exposures to Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, and Yb were related to fetal growth restriction. Cord blood vitamin D might alleviate toxic effects of these REEs and its reduction might partly mediate REE-induced fetal growth restriction.", "pub_date": "2023-12-09", "authors": ["Xingjie Fang", "Ya Xie", "Shuting Cao", "Jiangtao Liu", "Yujie Shi", "Ling Yu", "Tongzhang Zheng", "Hongxiu Liu", "Yuanyuan Li", "Shunqing Xu", "Wei Xia"], "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169222", "source": "pubmed"}

Fatigue is a symptom often associated with autoimmune diseases. Chronic inflammatory response and activated cell-mediated immunity are associated with cardiovascular myopathies which can be driven by muscle weakness and fatigue. Thus, we hypothesize that immune dysfunction-driven changes in myocyte mitochondria may play a critical role in fatigue-related pathogenesis. We show that persistent low-level expression of IFN-γ in designated IFN-γ AU-Rich Element deletion mice (ARE mice) under androgen exposure resulted in mitochondrial and metabolic deficiencies in myocytes from male or castrated ARE mice. Most notably, echocardiography unveiled that low ejection fraction in the left ventricle post-stress correlated with mitochondrial deficiencies, explaining how heart function decreases under stress. We report that inefficiencies and structural changes in mitochondria, with changes to expression of mitochondrial genes, are linked to male-biased fatigue and acute cardiomyopathy under stress. Our work highlights how male androgen hormone backgrounds and active autoimmunity reduce mitochondrial function and the ability to cope with stress and how pharmacological blockade of stress signal protects heart function. These studies provide new insight into the diverse actions of IFN-γ in fatigue, energy metabolism, and autoimmunity. © 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Its use is largely concentrated among young people (15- to 34-year-olds). There is a variety of cannabis use patterns, ranging from experimental use to dependent use. Men are more likely than women to report both early initiation and frequent use of cannabis. Due to the high prevalence of cannabis use, the impact of cannabis on public health may be significant. A range of acute and chronic health problems associated with cannabis use has been identified. Cannabis can frequently have negative effects in its users, which may be amplified by certain demographic and/or psychosocial factors. Acute adverse effects include hyperemesis syndrome, impaired coordination and performance, anxiety, suicidal ideations/tendencies, and psychotic symptoms. Acute cannabis consumption is also associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle crashes, especially fatal collisions. Evidence indicates that frequent and prolonged use of cannabis can be detrimental to both mental and physical health.

Since this process is physiologically needed in bones, but is pathological in arteries, a great deal of research has been devoted to finding a possible link between vitamin K and the prevention of osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, the current knowledge does not allow us to make a decisive conclusion about such a link. One possible explanation for this is the diversity of the biological activity of vitamin K, which is not a single compound but a general term covering natural plant and animal forms of vitamin K (K1 and K2) as well as their synthetic congeners (K3 and K4). Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) is found in several vegetables.

We aimed to determine if transcriptomic profiles could discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective, observational, double-cohort study was conducted in very low birth weight infants with clinical signs and culture-positive sepsis. Blood samples were collected when clinical signs became apparent. Total RNA was processed for transcriptomic analysis. Results were validated by both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and a mathematical model. RESULTS: We included 25 septic preterm infants, 17 with Gram-positive and 8 with Gram-negative bacteria. The principal component analysis identified these two clusters of patients. We performed a predictive model based on 21 genes that showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. Eight genes were overexpressed in Gram-positive septic infants: CD37, CSK, MAN2B2, MGAT1, MOB3A, MYO9B, SH2D3C, and TEP1. The most significantly overexpressed pathways were related to metabolic and immunomodulating responses that translated into an equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic profile allowed identification of whether the causative agent was Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The overexpression of genes such as CD37 and CSK, which control cytokine production and cell survival, could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. IMPACT: Transcriptomic profiles not only enable an early diagnosis of sepsis in very low birth weight infants but also discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents. The overexpression of some genes related to cytokine production and cell survival could explain the better clinical outcome in sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and could lead us to a future, targeted therapy.", "pub_date": "2021-03-25", "authors": ["María Cernada", "Alejandro Pinilla-González", "Julia Kuligowski", "José Manuel Morales", "Sheila Lorente-Pozo", "José David Piñeiro-Ramos", "Anna Parra-Llorca", "Inmaculada Lara-Cantón", "Máximo Vento", "Eva Serna"], "journal": "Pediatric research", "doi": "10.1038/s41390-021-01444-3", "source": "pubmed"}

METHODS: Descriptive retrospective study of children under 14 years of age diagnosed with IBIs in a PED of a tertiary hospital between January 2008 and December 2009. RESULTS: In this period we registered 123 396 episodes and 59 patients who were diagnosed with IBIs (22 patients under 1 year of age, 37.2%). Of these, 11 (18.6%) had some severe underlying condition and 38 (64.4%) were stable on arrival. The most common diagnoses were sepsis with/without meningitis (23, 38.9%) and bacteraemia (14, 23.7%), while the pathogens most frequently isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (23, 38.9%) and Neisseria meningitidis (18, 30.5%). Pathogens were isolated from blood in 57 patients and from the cerebrospinal fluid in eight (in these, the same bacterial species was isolated in the blood, except for two cases with S. pneumoniae). Of the pneumococci isolated, 80% corresponded to serotypes included in the 13-valent PCV13. In seven cases, pathogens were detected using only PCR analysis (N. meningitidis, four; S. pneumoniae, three). Twenty-five patients were admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit.

Ublituximab (ublituximab-xiiy) is the latest approved chimeric glycoengineered anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS. AREAS COVERED: In this narrative review, the authors explore the safety and effectiveness of data derived from the Phase 2 and Phase 3 ublituximab trials and from their respective post-hoc analyses. Moreover, they consider the similarities and differences between the currently available anti-CD20 antibodies for treatment of relapsing MS. Lastly, the authors discuss the role and place of ublituximab in the current disease modifying therapy landscape. EXPERT OPINION: Ublituximab is a rapid-acting and effective anti-inflammatory option as a treatment in people with relapsing MS that significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate and MRI-based disease activity. When compared to the Phase III trials of the other two anti-CD20 mAbs (ocrelizumab and ofatumumab), ublituximab did not result with reduction of 3 or 6-month confirmed disability progression. These differences may be attributed to the overall low rate of progression in both the ublituximab and the active comparator teriflunomide arm. Future data from open-label extensions are warranted.

Lecanemab is a humanized anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody directed towards Aβ protofibrils. Lecanemab is the only drug that targets Aβ soluble protofibrils and has shown statistical differences in mild AD or mild cognitive impairment. In its landmark phase III trial, lecanemab was shown to slow the progression of clinical decline, and a reduction in amyloid protein accumulation. The difference in mean CDR-SOB score improvement between the treatment and placebo groups was -0.45, of which the clinical significance could be argued. Amyloid burden was also considerably reduced as well, but the true clinical consequence of this reduction remains to be seen. This beneficial impact on daily living is offset by rare but serious side effects including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) causing cerebral edema (ARIA-E) or cerebral microhemorrhages or hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H). Benefits of therapy must be considered against the risk of cerebral microhemorrhages and edema. Affordability must also be taken into consideration. The current estimated yearly cost for twice monthly lecanemab infusion is $26,500. In addition to the significant cost challenges, the frequent infusions may pose concerns related to access.

Median overall survival is only one year. Currently, the scientific focus is on expanding the knowledge base of the molecular biology of DIPG, and identifying effective therapies. Oncolytic adenovirus DNX-2401 is a replication-competent, genetically modified virus capable of infecting and killing glioma cells, and stimulating an anti-tumor immune response. Clinical trials evaluating intratumoral DNX-2401 in adults with recurrent glioblastoma have demonstrated that the virus has a favorable safety profile and can prolong survival. Subsequently, these results have encouraged the transition of this biologically active therapy from adults into the pediatric population. To this aim, we have designed a clinical Phase I trial for newly diagnosed pediatric DIPG to investigate the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of delivering DNX-2401 into tumors within the pons following biopsy. This case report presents a pediatric patient enrolled in this ongoing Phase I trial for children and adolescents with newly diagnosed DIPG. The case involves an 8-year-old female patient with radiologically diagnosed DIPG who underwent stereotactic tumor biopsy immediately followed by intratumoral DNX-2401 in the same biopsy track. Because there were no safety concerns or new neurological deficits, the patient was discharged 3 days after the procedures. To our knowledge, this is the first report of intratumoral DNX-2401 for a patient with DIPG in a clinical trial. We plan to demonstrate that intratumoral delivery of an oncolytic virus following tumor biopsy for pediatric patients with DIPG is a novel and feasible approach and that DNX-2401 represents an innovative treatment for the disease.", "pub_date": "2018-03-12", "authors": ["Sonia Tejada", "Ricardo Díez-Valle", "Pablo D Domínguez", "Ana Patiño-García", "Marisol González-Huarriz", "Juan Fueyo", "Cande Gomez-Manzano", "Miguel Angel Idoate", "Joanna Peterkin", "Marta M Alonso"], "journal": "Frontiers in oncology", "doi": "10.3389/fonc.2018.00061", "source": "pubmed"}

Increasing use of cannabis has been associated with an increased risk of co-morbid psychotic spectrum disorders with worse outcomes. This risk increases with increased use in a dose-dependent manner. A very complex association exists between cannabis use and mental illness hence it is essential to understand the relationship between the two to facilitate better care and management. AIM: The present study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile and psychiatric co-morbidities of cannabis users attending a tertiary mental health establishment in Goa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case record study was carried out among self-reported cannabis users attending services at a tertiary mental health establishment from June 2021 to June 2022. Data regarding cannabis use, clinical profile, and socio-demographic profile of the individuals was obtained and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four cannabis users were evaluated which consisted of 140 males and 24 females, the mean age being 28 years with a standard deviation of 7.68. Ganja was the most commonly used form smoked as joints. The median age of initiation was 18 with females starting at a later age than males. Later initiation was associated with using lower quantities. Concurrent alcohol and nicotine use was present in 90% of the cases. The most commonly associated diagnosis was substance-induced psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in individuals with mental illness is more common in males and an early age of initiation was linked to earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness.", "pub_date": "2023-09-05", "authors": ["Soumya Jha", "Rupa Jha", "Wenona Fernandes", "Ashish Srivastava"], "journal": "Indian journal of psychiatry", "doi": "10.4103/indianjpsychiatry.indianjpsychiatry_239_23", "source": "pubmed"}

Since this law took effect, increased availability and use of cannabis in Michigan have led to increased emergency department (ED) visits associated with the drug's psychiatric effects. OBJECTIVES: To describe cannabis-induced anxiety disorder's prevalence, clinical features, and disposition in a community-based study. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive patients diagnosed with acute toxicity related to cannabis use (ICD-10 code F12). Patients were seen at seven EDs over a 24-month study period. Data collected included demographics, clinical features, and treatment outcomes in ED patients who met the criteria for cannabis-induced anxiety disorder. This group was compared to a cohort experiencing other forms of acute cannabis toxicity. Chi-squared and t-tests were used to compare these two groups across key demographic and outcome variables. RESULTS: During the study period, 1135 patients were evaluated for acute cannabis toxicity. A total of 196 patients (17.3%) had a chief complaint of anxiety, and 939 (82.7%) experienced other forms of acute cannabis toxicity, predominantly symptoms of intoxication or cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. Patients with anxiety symptoms had panic attacks (11.7%), aggression or manic behavior (9.2%), and hallucinations (6.1%). Compared to patients presenting with other forms of cannabis toxicity, those with anxiety were likelier to be younger, ingested edible cannabis, had psychiatric comorbidities, or had a history of polysubstance abuse.

Clinical examination, transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are significant preoperative non-invasive diagnosis procedures for the accurate assessment of endometriosis. Although TVS is used as the primary line for diagnosis, MRI is commonly utilized to achieve a better anatomical overview of the entire pelvic organs. The aim of this systematic review article is to thoroughly summarize the research on various endometriosis diagnosis methods that are less invasive. (2) Methods: To find relevant studies, we examined electronic databases, such as MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar, choosing 70 papers as references. (3) Results: The findings indicate that various approaches can contribute to diagnosis in different ways, depending on the type of endometriosis. For patients suspected of having deep pelvic endometriosis, transvaginal sonography should be the first line of diagnosis. Endometriosis cysts are better diagnosed with TVS, whereas torus, uterosacral ligaments, intestine, and bladder endometriosis lesions are best diagnosed using MRI. When it comes to detecting intestine or rectal nodules, as well as rectovaginal septum nodules, MRI should be the imaging tool of choice. (4) Conclusions: When diagnosing DE (deep infiltrative endometriosis), the examiner's experience is the most important criterion to consider. In the diagnosis of endometriosis, expert-guided TVS is more accurate than routine pelvic ultrasound, especially in the deep infiltrative form. For optimal treatment and surgical planning, accurate preoperative deep infiltrative endometriosis diagnosis is essential, especially because it requires a multidisciplinary approach.", "pub_date": "2022-07-21", "authors": ["Alexandra Baușic", "Ciprian Coroleucă", "Cătălin Coroleucă", "Diana Comandașu", "Roxana Matasariu", "Andrei Manu", "Francesca Frîncu", "Claudia Mehedințu", "Elvira Brătilă"], "journal": "Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)", "doi": "10.3390/diagnostics12071767", "source": "pubmed"}

It remains however unclear whether FUS is being introduced in an ethically and methodologically sound manner. The IDEAL-D framework for the introduction of surgical innovations and the SYRCLE and ROBINS-I tools for assessing the risk of bias in animal studies and non-randomized trials, respectively, provide a comprehensive evaluation for this. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature review on FUS in neuro-oncology was conducted. Subsequently, the included studies were evaluated using the IDEAL-D framework, SYRCLE, and ROBINS-I tools. RESULTS: In total, 19 published studies and 12 registered trials were identified. FUS demonstrated successful BBB disruption, increased drug delivery, and improved survival rates. However, the SYRCLE analysis revealed a high risk of bias in animal studies, while the ROBINS-I analysis found that most human studies had a high risk of bias due to a lack of blinding and heterogeneous samples. Of the 15 pre-clinical stage 0 studies, only six had formal ethical approval, and only five followed animal care policies. Both stage 1 studies and stage 1/2a studies failed to provide information on patient data confidentiality. Overall, no animal or human study reached the IDEAL-D stage endpoint. CONCLUSION: FUS holds promise for enhancing drug delivery to the brain, but its development and implementation must adhere to rigorous safety standards using the established ethical and methodological frameworks.

Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a debilitating disorder of unknown aetiology, characterised by severe disabling fatigue in the absence of alternative diagnosis. Historically, there has been a tendency to draw psychological explanations for the origin of fatigue; however, this model is at odds with findings that fatigue and accompanying symptoms may be explained by central and peripheral pathophysiological mechanisms, including effects of the immune, oxidative, mitochondrial, and neuronal pathways. For example, patient descriptions of their fatigue regularly cite difficulty in maintaining muscle activity due to perceived lack of energy. This narrative review examined the literature for evidence of biochemical dysfunction in CFS/ME at the skeletal muscle level. Methods. Literature was examined following searches of PUB MED, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, using key words such as CFS/ME, immune, autoimmune, mitochondria, muscle, and acidosis. Results. Studies show evidence for skeletal muscle biochemical abnormality in CFS/ME patients, particularly in relation to bioenergetic dysfunction. Discussion. Bioenergetic muscle dysfunction is evident in CFS/ME, with a tendency towards an overutilisation of the lactate dehydrogenase pathway following low-level exercise, in addition to slowed acid clearance after exercise.

AREAS COVERED: A phase 3 clinical trial of solanezumab in preclinical Alzheimer's disease. In the A4 study, solanezumab did not reduce the decline in cognition or function and had no effect on brain amyloid burden. EXPERT OPINION: After the poor results in the EXPEDITION series of trials, the development of solanezumab should have been terminated. The rationale for undertaking the A4 trial was questionable, and the lack of benefit was probable. The controversial approval of two anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (aducanumab and lecanemab) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), despite a high incidence of amyloid-related imagining abnormalities (ARIA), may be fueling this continuation of clinical development of agents such as solanezumab.

Guidelines recommend IV anesthesia when second-line ASMs have failed, but potential harms can outweigh the benefits. Novel treatments are needed to stop and durably control RSE without escalation to IV anesthetics. Ganaxolone is an investigational neuroactive steroid in development for RSE treatment. This study's objective was to determine the appropriate dosing for IV ganaxolone in RSE and obtain a preliminary assessment of efficacy and safety. METHODS: This was an open-label, phase 2 trial conducted from February 19, 2018 to September 18, 2019, at three sites in the United States. Patients were aged ≥12 years, had convulsive or nonconvulsive SE, and failed to respond to ≥1 second-line IV ASM. Twenty-one patients were screened; 17 were enrolled. Patients received IV ganaxolone added to standard-of-care ASMs. Ganaxolone infusion was initiated as an IV bolus (over 3 min) with continuous infusion of decreasing infusion rates for 48-96 h followed by an 18-h taper. There were three ganaxolone dosing cohorts: low, 500 mg/day; medium, 650 mg/day; and high, 713 mg/day. The primary end point was the number of patients not requiring escalation to IV anesthetic treatment within 24 h of ganaxolone initiation. RESULTS: Most of the 17 enrolled patients (65%) had nonconvulsive SE, and had failed a median of three prior ASMs, including first-line benzodiazepine and second-line IV ASM therapy. Median time to SE cessation following ganaxolone initiation was 5 min. No patient required escalation to third-line IV anesthetics during the 24-h period following ganaxolone initiation. Two treatment-related serious adverse events (sedation) were reported. Of the three deaths, none was considered related to ganaxolone; all occurred 9-22 days after completing ganaxolone.
