      "The burden of human trypanosomiases in European hospitals is linked to imported cases from travelers, tourists, migrants, or expatriates who have been in endemic areas. While specific annual case numbers are not provided, Spain has the highest burden of Chagas disease (a form of trypanosomiasis) in Europe. The presence of Trypanosoma species in Europe is typically associated with travel or immigration history or infected animals. Despite progress in reducing human African trypanosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa, its occurrence in Europe remains a consideration for differential diagnosis among certain patient groups. Additionally, the region faces broader healthcare challenges, such as primary care crises and hospital pressures post-COVID-19, which could impact the management of these diseases.",
      "Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, poses a significant global threat, affecting approximately 70 million people in 36 African countries. Although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the burden of HAT in European hospitals is relatively low or negligible, given that HAT is primarily confined to Africa and there is no mention of significant cases or outbreaks in European regions. However, it's essential to note that Chagas disease, another form of trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, has a substantial presence in Latin America, but its direct burden in European hospitals is not quantified here. Nonetheless, considering the geographical distribution and prevalence of these diseases, it appears that the primary concern regarding trypanosomiases in European hospitals relates to imported cases rather than local transmission, highlighting the importance of vigilance and preparedness among clinicians in diagnosing and managing these conditions in non-endemic settings.",
      "Between 2011-2020, 49 cases of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) were diagnosed in 16 non-endemic countries across five continents, with a majority caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense in tourists visiting Africa and T. b. gambiense in African migrants returning from endemic areas. The prevalence of HAT diagnosis in non-endemic countries is rare but significant, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance to support the World Health Organization's (WHO) elimination goals.",
      "The burden of human trypanosomiases in European hospitals is primarily associated with Chagas disease and human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, has a prevalence of approximately 4.2% among Latin American migrants in Europe, with significant underdiagnosis and lack of screening programs. The disease can lead to severe complications such as cardiomyopathy and gastrointestinal issues. Human African trypanosomiasis, though less common, poses a risk to travelers and migrants from endemic regions. The increasing incidence of these diseases in Europe is attributed to migration and tourism, highlighting the need for improved awareness, diagnosis, and treatment in healthcare settings.",
      "The burden of human trypanosomiases in European hospitals is relatively low. Between 2011 and 2020, there were 49 cases of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) reported across multiple non-endemic countries, including those in Europe. These cases were primarily among tourists and migrants from Africa, indicating that the disease is mostly imported and not endemic to Europe."

      "The decision to perform gender-affirming surgery (GAS) on individuals under 18 years of age involves balancing medical, psychological, and ethical considerations. Data indicates that breast and chest surgeries are the most common procedures in adolescents aged 12-18, often aimed at alleviating gender dysphoria and improving mental health outcomes. Hormonal therapy plays a preparatory role for some patients, though its long-term impact on surgical results is still under study. More complex procedures, such as genital reconstruction, are primarily performed on older patients due to additional medical and psychological considerations. The appropriateness of GAS for minors requires a multidisciplinary approach, careful assessment of individual circumstances, and comprehensive informed consent to ensure the best possible outcomes.",
      "Gender-affirming surgery can be performed on individuals under 18 under specific circumstances, supported by international guidelines and when deemed appropriate for the individual's mental health and quality of life. While restrictions and legal guidelines often set 18 as the age of consent, there are instances where these surgeries, such as chest wall masculinization, have been provided to individuals under 18 to support their gender identity and improve mental health outcomes.",
      "Studies suggest that gender-affirming surgeries are being increasingly performed on transgender adolescents, with many undergoing procedures such as mastectomies before the age of 18. These interventions, when conducted in accordance with international guidelines, have been associated with improvements in mental health and quality of life for gender-diverse individuals. However, the legal and regulatory landscape varies, with some regions requiring individuals to be at least 18 years old for certain surgical procedures. This highlights a tension between current medical practices and legal restrictions, underscoring the need for further discussion and clarification on the appropriate age for such interventions.",
      "While there is a lack of consensus, current evidence suggests that gender-affirming surgeries should generally be reserved for those aged 18 and over due to the irreversible nature of the procedures and ethical concerns regarding maturity and consent. However, puberty blockers and hormone therapies are commonly used in adolescents to support gender transitions.",
      "Gender-affirming surgery may be considered in carefully selected individuals under 18 years of age, particularly adolescents diagnosed with clear and persistent gender dysphoria, following thorough evaluation and multidisciplinary team assessment. However, the decision to proceed with surgery should take into account the individual's physical and emotional maturity, potential long-term implications, and available evidence-based guidelines. In some cases, such as clitoroplasty for clitoromegaly, surgical intervention during infancy has been shown to yield highly satisfactory outcomes, suggesting that early intervention can be beneficial when medically indicated. Nevertheless, each case requires a nuanced consideration of the unique circumstances, weighing the potential benefits against the risks and uncertainties associated with irreversible surgical interventions in minors."

      "Fatigue is a complex symptom with multiple pathophysiological pathways. Key mechanisms include alterations in gut-brain axis activity, gut dysbiosis, and increased gut permeability, as seen in conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome. In fibromyalgia, metabolic disruptions such as tyrosine, purine, and pyrimidine pathway changes, as well as glutaminergic neurotransmission abnormalities, play a role. Cancer-related fatigue involves phospholipid metabolism disturbances, endocannabinoid system changes, and glycerophospholipid imbalances. Post-COVID-19 fatigue is linked to dysautonomia, micro-clotting, impaired oxygen delivery, and disruptions in cellular energy metabolism. These pathways highlight the importance of tailored therapeutic strategies to address the underlying causes of fatigue.",
      "Fatigue involves multiple pathophysiological pathways, including central nervous system dysfunction characterized by inflammation, reduced glucose metabolism, brain atrophy, demyelination, and axonal damage. It also implicates hypofunction of the glutamatergic system due to decreased acetyl-carnitine uptake in specific brain regions. Additionally, metabolic changes, particularly in response to stress, play a role. Abnormalities in neuromuscular junctions and myotendinous junctions contribute to fatigue symptoms, especially in conditions like major depressive disorder. The involvement of inflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and the autonomic nervous system is suggested, though further research is needed. In fibromyalgia, fatigue is linked to chronic widespread pain and disruptions in both ascending pain and descending inhibitory sensory pathways. These mechanisms underscore the complexity of fatigue across various chronic illnesses.",

Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and -6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and tryptophan catabolites, are implicated in the mechanisms causing fatigue. Additionally, dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems, including GABAergic/glutamatergic transmission, and alterations in brain networks involved in cognitive/attentional processes are also associated with fatigue. Mitochondrial dysfunction, driven by immune dysfunction-related changes in myocyte mitochondria, is proposed as a critical role in fatigue-related pathogenesis. Furthermore, studies indicate that inflammation may be a common link between fatigue, pain, and depression, and that biologic agents targeting inflammatory cytokines can be effective in alleviating fatigue.",

    "ideal_answer": [
      "Depression in children under 11 is influenced by multiple factors. Psychological causes include internalizing disorders and emotional dysregulation, as reflected in increased prevalence with self-reported emotional disorders. Biological causes involve dysregulations in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, with alterations in cortisol and immune biomarkers observed in children with ADHD. Additionally, environmental stressors, such as high parental stress and caregiver burden, can negatively impact children's emotional well-being, increasing their risk for developmental and mood disorders.",
      "Depression in children under 11 can be caused by various interrelated factors. Key causes include the influence of parental depression or bipolar disorder, stressful events, and loss. Children with psychological conditions such as attention, learning, conduct, or anxiety disorders are at a higher risk of depression. External influences like traumatic experiences and socioeconomic stress, such as community poverty and unemployment, also play a role. Children's self-perception, specifically a tendency towards depressive attributional styles and low self-perceived competence, are additional contributors.",
      "Research suggests that various factors contribute to the development of depression in children under 11. Studies indicate that children who experience stress, loss, or have attention, learning, conduct, or anxiety disorders are at higher risk for depressive disorders. Additionally, children living with a parent who has depression are more likely to develop depression themselves. Other significant predictors include family history of depression, subclinical depressive symptoms, anxiety, stressful life events, and neurobiological dysregulation. Furthermore, being female, having low paternal age or low birth weight, experiencing negative events in the family, childhood emotional abuse, and adverse socioeconomic conditions are also associated with an increased risk of depression in children.",
      "Depression in children under 11 can be caused by a variety of factors including child abuse and neglect, bullying, chronic stress, parental depression, loss of significant relationships, and pre-existing mental health disorders like attention, learning, conduct, or anxiety disorders. Additionally, broader socio-economic factors such as community poverty and unemployment, as well as low self-perceived competence, can contribute to the development of depressive symptoms in children.",
      "Depression in children under 11 is influenced by a combination of factors, including parental mental health issues such as maternal depression and anxiety, which can affect children both during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal stress during pregnancy is particularly linked to increased risks of depression in later childhood, especially if the child was born small for gestational age. Exposure to abuse, neglect, or intimate partner violence also significantly elevates the risk of depressive symptoms. Bullying at school further contributes to such risks, along with young maternal age and lower intelligence test scores. Additionally, cognitive factors like a child's ability to regulate emotions play a role, while post-traumatic stress disorder often co-occurs with depression in trauma-exposed children. Together, these genetic, environmental, and social elements create a multifaceted landscape of risk factors for childhood depression.",
      "Depression in children under 11 can be caused by various factors, including parental intimate partner violence, maternal depression, and paternal concurrent affective symptoms. Studies have shown that increasing maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of symptoms of moderate to severe depression in 11-year-old children, especially those who were born small for gestational age (SGA). Additionally, child abuse and neglect are linked to a higher risk of developing depression, with physically abused children and those experiencing multiple types of abuse being at increased risk of lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD). Furthermore, gender nonconformity is a strong predictor of depressive symptoms in children, particularly among males and heterosexuals. Other factors such as being bullied at school, lower intelligence test scores, and young maternal age can also contribute to the development of depression in children under 11. Overall, these studies suggest that a combination of genetic, environmental, and social factors can contribute to the onset of depression in young children."

These trials focus on evaluating the effectiveness and acceptability of various hormonal substances for male fertility regulation, including different combinations of androgens and gestagens, as well as cyproterone acetate.",
      "Yes, there are clinical trials on hormonal male birth control methods. As of June 2023, two hormonal male contraceptive methods are undergoing phase II clinical trials for safety and efficacy. These methods involve the use of a long-acting combination of an androgen plus a progestin, which have been shown to be efficacious, reversible, and well-tolerated in clinical trials with healthy men. Additionally, a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial by the pharmaceutical industry has demonstrated the effectiveness of a combination of testosterone undecanoate and etonogestrel in suppressing spermatogenesis in volunteers. Overall, these developments suggest that the first marketed male hormonal contraceptive method is likely to be a long-acting hormonal method.",
      "Yes, there are ongoing clinical trials on hormonal male birth control methods. Studies have shown that these methods, which involve administering hormones such as testosterone alone or in combination with a progestin, can effectively and reversibly suppress sperm production in men, making them a potential new option for male contraception. Several regimens, including injectable testosterone undecanoate, dimethandrolone undecanoate, and transdermal Nestorone plus testosterone gel, have been tested in clinical trials with promising results, demonstrating high efficacy and reversibility. However, further research is needed to identify the best delivery system and formulation for widespread use. Several large-scale phase IIb and III trials are ongoing or planned to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of these methods in preventing pregnancies.",
      "Yes, there are clinical trials on hormonal male birth control methods. Recent advancements in male contraception have led to the development of various hormonal approaches, including combinations of androgens and progestins. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and reversibility of these hormonal methods, with some formulations showing contraceptive efficacy rates higher than condoms. Notable agents currently in clinical trials include dimethandrolone undecanoate and testosterone combined with segesterone acetate. These trials are crucial for expanding contraceptive options for men and addressing the global need for effective male contraceptives."

There are also no established non-invasive methods to diagnose patients with endometriosis. Therefore, there is a need for non-invasive or minimally invasive tests to accurately diagnose the location and extent of endometriotic lesions. Low invasive tests including imaging, genetic tests, biomarkers, or miRNAs could be potential solutions. At present, the only conclusive way to diagnose endometriosis is through laparoscopic inspection with histological confirmation. Noninvasive markers of endometriosis have the potential to enable sooner diagnosis, leading to more timely treatment and better surgical planning, particularly for early-stage endometriosis.",
      "MRI, transvaginal ultrasound with bowel preparation (TVUS-BP), and Raman spectroscopy are among the best non-invasive methods for diagnosing endometriosis. MRI and TVUS-BP provide reliable imaging to detect various forms of endometriosis, while Raman spectroscopy offers a promising diagnostic potential by analyzing blood sera.",
      "The best non-invasive methods to diagnose endometriosis are transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), and potentially Raman spectroscopy. These imaging modalities, particularly TVUS and MRI, provide high sensitivity and specificity and are effective alternatives to the invasive laparoscopy procedure. In addition, Raman spectroscopy is emerging as a non-invasive diagnostic technique for endometriosis.",
      "The best non-invasive methods to diagnose endometriosis include transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), MRI, Raman spectroscopy, and FTIR spectroscopy. TVUS and MRI are particularly good at detecting pelvic endometriosis and deep infiltrating endometriosis with high accuracy, whereas Raman and FTIR spectroscopy show promise as non-invasive diagnostic approaches using blood sera and cervical swabs, respectively.",
      "Several studies have investigated non-invasive methods for diagnosing endometriosis, with varying degrees of success. Transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) has been found to be a highly accurate and reproducible method for diagnosing deep endometriosis, with sensitivity and specificity comparable to diagnostic laparoscopy. Additionally, studies have explored the use of biomarkers in plasma samples, such as annexin V, VEGF, CA-125, and sICAM-1/or glycodelin, which have shown promising results in diagnosing endometriosis with high sensitivity and acceptable specificity. Other non-invasive techniques, including MRI, FTIR spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, have also been investigated, with MRI being capable of detecting many manifestations of endometriosis in a reliable manner. Overall, while no single method has emerged as the definitive non-invasive diagnostic tool, TVUS and biomarker analysis appear to be the most promising approaches, offering a balance of accuracy and invasiveness."
